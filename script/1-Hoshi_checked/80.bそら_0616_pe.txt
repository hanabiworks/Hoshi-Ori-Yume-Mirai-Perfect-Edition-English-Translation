The next day.
I feel someone poke me in the back as I'm walking to school.
％Ｂ
「Hm?」
I turn around. It's Ousaka. I didn't even notice she was behind me.
Sora
「...Morning.」
％Ｂ
「Y-Yeah... Ousaka... Morning.」
I don't see her much in the mornings.
I'm a little nervous from how sudden this is.
％Ｂ
「Wait, do we take the same bus?」
Sora
「...Probably.」
％Ｂ
「Really. I never noticed.」
Sora
「...Because I'm small...」
％Ｂ
「It's not like I couldn't spot you 'cause you were buried in other people...」

No need to be so self-deprecating...
Sora
「...Mm.」
％Ｂ
「Hm?」
Ousaka turns away from me.
It's then that I notice something swaying to and fro on her bag. 
％Ｂ
「Oh... Is that the strap from yesterday?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
She's put the strap I got in the lottery yesterday on her phone.

Sora
「...I like it.」
％Ｂ
「O-Oh really... I'm glad.」
It's not a strange thing for her to say, but it makes me happy inside.
It's not like it's something I bought for her.
But seeing her like and make use of something I gave her just makes me happy.

％Ｂ
「Oh, right. I need to stop by the committee office for a second after school, so I'll be a bit late in showing up to the astronomy club. Could you wait for me?」


Sora
「...The forecast said it's going to be cloudy again starting in the afternoon. I'll read books again depending on the weather.」

％Ｂ
「Oh, really. I'll come read with you again after I'm done, then. Same classroom as last time?」

Sora
「...I'll contact you if it happens.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, that'd be great.」
Sora
「...I'm this way.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah.」
The first and second years' classrooms are on different floors.
This is where I part ways with Ousaka.
％Ｂ
「See you after school, then.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
I watch Ousaka as she walks to her classroom.
Until her back completely disappears.
％Ｂ
「...Phew.」
I wonder why...
I felt really sad about having to part with Ousaka just now.
Maybe it's because I've been doing stuff with her a lot lately. It's become pretty natural for me to be with her.

％Ｂ
「...I guess I'm being a little too conscious of her.」
Classical Literature Teacher
「Did you know? Though the moon appears quite often in Japanese songs and classical text, the stars are not featured very much at all.」


％Ｂ
「...」
Classical Literature Teacher
「I don't know the precise reasons why, but it seems Japanese people of the past held little admiration for the stars.」

...Ousaka would probably get mad if she were here.
Classical Literature Teacher
「However, there is still one famous Japanese classical text containing writings on the subject of stars. I'm sure you're all very familiar with it. What is its name? Let's see... Narusawa-san.」


Rikka
「Yes... The Pillow Book.」
Classical Literature Teacher
「Correct. "The Pillow Book," penned by Sei Shounagon in the Heian era, has musings related to the stars. I will now read an excerpt.」


Classical Literature Teacher
「"Stars beg of Pleiades, Hikoboshi, Hesperus. Curious is the falling star. Curiouser yet, tailless."」

Classical Literature Teacher
「There are four different stars referred to in that excerpt. First is "Pleiades," next is "Hikoboshi," then "Hesperus." "Falling star" would be the last.」


Classical Literature Teacher
「I imagine many of you are already familiar with the Pleiades stars from musical references. Hikoboshi would refer to Hikoboshi from the legend of Tanabata. Does anyone know, then, what the third star, "Hesperus," is?」


...I bet Ousaka'd know.
She probably would've answered right away.
Classical Literature Teacher
「I will give you a hint. Hesperus is also known as the "Evening Star."」
％Ｂ
「Oh...」
Isn't that...?
Classical Literature Teacher
「
Hino-kun, 
You, 
do you know the answer?」
％Ｂ
「Oh, uh... Is it Venus?」
Classical Literature Teacher
「Correct. You're very knowledgeable.」
...Only because Ousaka told me about it.
Classical Literature Teacher
「The "falling star" refers to meteors, not one specific star. With what we've gone over so far in mind, I will now attempt to translate the text into modern language.」


Classical Literature Teacher
「"The Pleiades are a good example of stars. Hikoboshi and Venus are good too. The uniqueness of meteors also makes them beautiful. But they would be even better without tails"... would be a rough translation.」


Classical Literature Teacher
「One can see from this that Sei Shounagon was very scholarly, even on the subject of stars.」

...Ousaka knows way more than Sei Shounagon, though.
Wait... Why the heck have I been bringing up Ousaka this whole time?

After I was criticizing myself for being too conscious of her this morning, too...
％Ｂ
「Sigh...」
What's gotten into me...?
Sora
「...
Ryou
Mm
.」
Sora
「...
Ryou
Mm
.」
Sora
「...Sour.」
Sora
「...You won't get tired this way.」
Sora
「...Salty.」
Sora
「...
Ryou
Mm
.」
％Ｂ
「...O...Ousa...」
Classical Literature Teacher
「...kun... 
Hino-kun, please 
Please 
wake up.」
％Ｂ
「Fueh?」
Classical Literature Teacher
「Not "Fueh," no. Please do not sleep during class.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, whoops... I'm sorry...」
...I fell asleep.
So then... that was a dream just now.
Rikka
「What are you doing?」
％Ｂ
「Ughh... More like, you should've woken me up.」
Rikka
「I decided to leave you be because you looked so happy.」
％Ｂ
「...Did I?」
Rikka
「You were grinning.」
％Ｂ
「...Uh huh.」
all
So I was dreaming about Ousaka, and grinning...
I guess this is pretty serious...
I've come to the event committee office after classes.
It's time to make the weekly Monday progress report on the astronomy club that Shuuichi asked me to do.

Shuuichi
「So how are things with the astronomy club?」
％Ｂ
「Well... Looking at the stars is ridiculously fun!」
Shuuichi
「...Hm?」
％Ｂ
「You know how we stayed here late the other day? I got to see the moon at night, and it was way prettier than during the day! I was floored! And also, the Summer Triangle! You know all three stars?」


Shuuichi
「...No... What are you talking about?」
％Ｂ
「Vega in Lyra, Altair in Aquila, Deneb in Cygnus. Those three stars make a big triangle in the sky. That's the Summer Triangle.」


Shuuichi
「...Oh really. So anyway, about the astronomy―」
％Ｂ
「Altair's Hikoboshi. Vega's Orihime. Did you know?」

Shuuichi
「...Yeah, I did know that. More importantly, the astro―」
％Ｂ
「And the Big Dipper! That's actually a part of a larger constellation called Ursa Major, from the end of its tail to its hips.」


Shuuichi
「...」
％Ｂ
「It's so fun learning new things! I don't think I'll ever get enough of this!」

Shuuichi
「...Yes, I agree. But what I want to know is how things are progressing in terms of you getting the astronomy club to participate in the Tanabata Festival.」


％Ｂ
「Huh?」
Shuuichi
「It's great that you're having fun in the astronomy club, but you better not forget your actual objective there.」

Shuuichi
「You're over there right now to try to get the club to participate in the Tanabata Festival, remember?」

％Ｂ
「Y-Yeah... I know.」
Shuuichi
「Do you? It sounds more like you've pretty much just become a member of the astronomy club...」

all
Marika
「Excuse me.」
all
Natsuki
「What's uuuup!? Huh? 
Hino? What are you doing here? 
What are you doing here? 
Aren't you going to the astronomy club today?」
％Ｂ
「...I'm going after I'm done here.」
all
Marika
「So has Ousaka-san decided to participate in the Tanabata Festival?」
％Ｂ
「No... Not yet.」
Marika
「Really～ So she's still not interested～ Want me to come with you to try to convince her, then?」

％Ｂ
「Uh...?」
Marika
「The naturalist club's doing pretty well right now, so I can help at least a little too now.」

Shuuichi
「Yeah, that'd be fine. 
Ryousuke. 

If it's looking hard for you to do this alone, then have Shinozaki help you.」
％Ｂ
「N-No, I'm fine on my own! I'll ask for your help a little later!」

Marika
「But―」
％Ｂ
「I'll handle the astronomy club. I swear I'll convince Ousaka!」
Marika
「You sure? Okay then...」

Natsuki
「Hmm... I seeee.」
％Ｂ
「Wh-What's there to see, Segawa?」
Natsuki
「Mmm? Just something personal～」
％Ｂ
「Sigh...」
I totally shot down Shinozaki's offer to help...
And I got so frantic about it too...
I honestly thought back then that I didn't want anyone getting in the way of my time together with Ousaka.

％Ｂ
「I hope Shuuichi and the others didn't notice...」
Segawa was kinda acting like she did...
％Ｂ
「Not good... What the heck am I doing...?」
％Ｂ
「Hm...?」
【Sora】「Getting cloudy. I'm #Ngoing to read today.」
【％Ｂ】「Got it. I'll head over #Nnow.」
【Sora】「I'll be waiting.」
％Ｂ
「...She'll be waiting.」
I can't stop myself from smiling.
％Ｂ
「...Gasp!? No, no... I'm working to try to convince Ousaka to participate in the festival, as a member of the event committee.」

I need to pull myself together a bit...!
Sora
「...There was once a queen named Europa, in the country of Phoenicia. Europa was incredibly beautiful. One day, while she was enjoying herself with her handmaidens by the seaside, a single bull approached her.」


Sora
「Europa got onto the bull's back to entertain herself. The bull then began running with Europa still on its back. The bull abducted her.」


％Ｂ
「What's with that bull?」
Sora
「...The bull was Zeus.」
That old man again!?
Sora
「...Zeus placed the shape of his own transformation into the stars. That's Taurus.」

％Ｂ
「...I guess Zeus is a narcissist as well as an old pervert.」
Sora
「...In addition, Zeus gave Europa new land, and bestowed that land with her name. That's the origin of what we know as Europe.」


％Ｂ
「Huh, really. So that's where the name "Europe" comes from.」
Ousaka and I met up in the same classroom, and now she's telling me about the stars again.

It's fun talking to her.
I always want to hear more.
％Ｂ
「Hey, what other kinds of stories are there?」
Sora
「...There was once a hero named Bellerophon. He was very strong, but that also made him really proud and full of himself.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, people like that exist.」
Sora
「...Bellerophon rode his beloved steed Pegasus toward the heavens, trying to become one of the gods. But Zeus got angry in response.」


％Ｂ
「There's the old man again.」
Sora
「...Zeus released a single gadfly. Pegasus panicked after being stung by the gadfly, and threw Bellerophon to the ground. Bellerophon died.」


％Ｂ
「That's terrible... Though I bet Zeus thought he deserved it.」
Sora
「...Pegasus continued up into the heavens and became a constellation. That's Pegasus.」

％Ｂ
「Wait a second... So Bellerophon didn't even matter for the story? And Pegasus just killed his master and became a constellation without him...」


Sora
「...There are lots of constellation myths that are unfair.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, seriously. Though that makes them interesting.」
Sora
「...Do you like these kinds of stories
, Ryou

?」
％Ｂ
「Y-Yeah... I dunno if it's I like them or that they're just interesting... Oh, sorry, I wasn't getting in the way of your reading, was I?」


Sora
「...*shake shake shake*」
Sora
「...It's fine because I like talking about stars.」
％Ｂ
「Really. Could you tell me a bit more, then?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
all
...I ended up having Ousaka tell me about the stars the entire time until we had to leave.
That's all we did today.\n\r
Even though I told myself I need to pull it together right before seeing her...
But instead of feeling bad about it, here I am feeling satisfied after enjoying my time together with Ousaka again today...

％Ｂ
「...I can't just keep doing this, can I...」
Sora
「...Something wrong?」
％Ｂ
「Uhh... No... Nothing.」
Sora
「...」
Sora
「...How are Misa's preparations going?」
％Ｂ
「Hm? You mean the naturalist club's aquarium? I remember Shinozaki said they were going pretty well.」

Sora
「...Really. That's good.」
％Ｂ
「Curious?」
Sora
「...Because the fish were pretty. I want to see them again.」

％Ｂ
「They apparently take care of them every day, so they'll probably show them to you if you go after school. Wanna go sometime?」

Sora
「...*nod*」
Sora
「...」
Sora
「Are Misa and the others having fun?」
％Ｂ
「Huh? Are you starting to get interested in the festival?」
Sora
「...Interest...」
She's never reacted like this before.
Maybe she's...
Sora
「...*shake shake*」
Oh, I guess not.
Sora
「...I don't really know.」
％Ｂ
「Okay... Well, there's still time. You can think it over carefully.」
Sora
「...」
But still, that reaction of hers just now...
It may have just been her wondering about how the naturalist club is doing, but it seems like Ousaka's feelings on the matter have changed at least a little.

Maybe her tagging along with the rest of us to catch the fish for the aquarium's affected her...
