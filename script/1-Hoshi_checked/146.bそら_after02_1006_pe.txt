The exterior of Shuuichi's house is done by October.
Shuuichi
「Ohh... Oohhhhh! It's definitely a capital-L Love Nest for Kaori and me! I love it!」

％Ｂ
「R-Really...」
I was personally going for a "spacious and stylish" design...

Well, if "capital-L Love Nest" is what he wants, then that's fine...
Shuuichi
「When's this going to be fully completed?」
％Ｂ
「It's progressing pretty steadily, so the interior'll be done by December. You'll be able to live in it by the end of the year if you want.」

Shuuichi
「So I'll be able to welcome the new year in a new home! I like the sound of that! Thanks so much, man.」

％Ｂ
「What are you talking about? I should be the one thanking you for deciding to entrust a newly opened firm with something as big as a house.」

We exchange a firm handshake and thank each other.
I head to Azuma-san's firm in the afternoon.
It's to have him check over the final blueprint for the cultural hall that I've drafted.

％Ｂ
「...What do you think?」
Azuma
「Yeah... Hmmh...」
％Ｂ
「U-Um...? Is there a problem of some sort?」
Azuma
「...Not good...」
％Ｂ
「...What!?」
Azuma
「I don't have anything left to complain about.」
％Ｂ
「Wha... Please don't do that. You're going to give me a heart attack.」
Azuma
「Still though, I'm surprised you've done this well on your first facility design. It's impressive.」

％Ｂ
「Thank you very much.」
No matter what happens, it always makes me happy when Azuma-san praises me.

Azuma
「The rest's up to my firm now. You can move onto a different job now.」

％Ｂ
「But I need to be there for the meeting with the contractors―」
Azuma
「I told you it's up to us, didn't I? Just let us handle it. It's a distributed effort.」

％Ｂ
「Uh huh...」
...Wait a second, did Azuma-san take on all of the bureaucratic work so I could fully concentrate on the design and blueprint drafting...?


％Ｂ
「...」
Well, I doubt he'd give me an answer if I asked him.
He's never honest when it comes to these sorts of things...
Azuma
「What? You still got something you wanna say?」
％Ｂ
「...Thank you very much... Teacher.」
I bow my head low to him.
I try to communicate all of my gratitude and thoughts with the gesture.
Azuma
「...Hmph... Either way, don't worry about it. I'll still have you come by when construction's about to start, though.」

all
He waves me away and leaves the room.\n \n\r

I bow my head low once more to his back.
Sora
「...Good evening.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, evening.」
Sora shows up after work while I'm finishing up some work.
She seems excited in general.
Sora
「...I want to show you something.」
％Ｂ
「Hm? What?」
She pulls out a small vial about three centimeters tall from her bag.

There's white, star-shaped sand inside.
％Ｂ
「Oh, it's star sand!」
Sora
「...It got delivered to the science museum today.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, this is what I was talking about!」
Sora
「...We're planning on handing them out in bags labeled with "Shooting Star Children."」
％Ｂ
「I like it. I bet the kids'll love it. I think it's just the something extra you wanted for your show.」

Sora
「...*nod*」
Sora
「...Hearing you say that makes me feel more confident. Thank you, Ryou.」

Sora
「...Hearing you say that makes me feel more confident. Thank you.」

％Ｂ
「I hope it goes well. I just submitted the blueprint for the cultural hall to Teacher today myself. That's one big job done.」


Sora
「...That's good. Can you take a bit of a break now?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. Let's line up our breaks sometime next month or so and take a trip together. I'm pretty tired, so I wanna relax a little.」

Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「How about we see the stars from some hot springs again?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「We'll do that, then.」
We imagine our hot springs trip for next month as we look at the star sand.
As if we were making a wish on the "Shooting Star Children" in our hands.
Sora
「
Ryou,
Do 
 you still have work do to?」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Yeah, sorry. I've finished the design for the community hall, but I want to have the materials ready by today.」

Sora
「Alright. Want me to get you some coffee?」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「That would be great, thanks.」
Sora
「Umhm」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Sorry that you can't go home yet, Sora.」
Sora
「It's fine. I have stuff to do anyways.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Alright then.」
She probably wants to work on her projection program now that the star sand has arrived.
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Is that desk fine? If you need a computer, then I can give you my spare laptop.」

Sora
「It's fine.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Oh, okay then.」
all
Well, if she needs anything, I'm sure she'll holler.
I return to my own desk and continue dealing with the remaining work I have left.
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Alright, it's done!」
I print the materials I collected from my computer and bind then in a folder. I finally finished the work for the Community Hall.

Sora
「Good job. Here's some tea.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Ah, thanks.」
all
The timing couldn't be any better. I take a sip of the warm tea.
The heat emanates through my stiff body and sore eyes. 
As I'm drinking, I look at the time.

％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Damn, it's almost midnight. Didn't think I'd stay for this long...」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「You must have finished by now, right Sora?」
Sora
「I still have a bit left.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Alright then. I won't bug you then. Work for as long as you want.」

Sora
「Umhm」
But exactly is she doing?
I can't it see to well from my desk, but I have a feeling she's going back and forth from the kitchen table and the reception desk.

Sora
「
Ryou, are 
Are 
 you hungry?」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Hmm? Oh yeah, I didn't even eat dinner.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「I guess you haven't either, Sora? What do you want? Since it's so late, I guess something like ramen or gyudon wouldn't sound too bad now.」


％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Oh, there might be a diner that's open.」
Sora
「Hehe...」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Are you hungry?」
Sora doesn't reply, instead she stares at the clock.
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Sora?」
Sora
「10... 9... 8... 7... 6...」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「You're counting down?」
Sora
「5... 4... 3... 2... 1!」
*Bang*
In place of zero, I feel Sora hugging me.
Frankly, it catches me off guard as I did not see this coming.

％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Uh, what's wrong?」
Sora
「It's now the 7th...」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「7th? Oh yeah, the date changed.」
Sora
「Happy birthday.」
Happy... Birthday...?
...
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Oh, right! It's my birthday today!
Sora
「You forgot?」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「I mean, I noted the date down, but I guess my birthday must have slipped from my mind.」

Since I started working, I've noted down days for important deadlines.
I've made sure to remember Sora's birthday too.

Sora
「It's fine. Even if 
Ryou forgets, 
you forget, 
I won't forget.」
Sora
「Today's the day the most imporant person in my life was born. Ot course it would be a special day for me.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Thank you, Sora.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「That being said, the thing you said you had to do...」
Sora
「I was waiting for the date to change so I could wish 
Ryou 
 you 
 a happy birthday.」
Sora
「And...」
all
Sora heads to the kitchen and opens the fridge. She comes back with a small cake in hand.

Sora
「I made it for you!」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「A homemade cake!」
all
She made a cute and small cake. 
The cake has small silver beads sprinkled throughout.
On top of a cake is a chocolate board and written in white chocolate is the phrase
「
Happy Birth Day 
Ryou」.
On top of a cake is a chocolate board and written in white chocolate is the phrase「
Happy Birth Day
％Ｂ」.
Sora
「You made me hamburgers for my birthday, so I'm returning the favour.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「That makes me so happy. Thanks so much.」
I feel myself welling up with emotion looking at the cake.
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「So what's with the silver balls?」
Sora
「They're silver dragee. It's made with sugar and strach that is groudned up and covered in edible silver dust. It's a topping for sweets.」

％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「So they're sweet... And they kind of look like stars.」
Sora
「Umhm」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「And you made the 12 major constellations around the rim.」
Sora
「Mm!」
Sora
「You noticed right away...」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Haha... that's elementary. I've been with you for so long that the 12 major constellations are drilled into my head.」

％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「But what constellations are you hiding on top of the cake...?」
all
I stare at the cake.
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Tch... Hmm... Uhh...?」
They look like constellations but their name escape me.
I give Sora a quick glance.
Sora
「Mmph.」
She's getting cocky.
Damn it, I can think about this all day, but the answer won't come to me.
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「I give up. What constellation are you hiding?」
Sora
「Chamaeleon, Pavo, Sourthern Cross and Centaurus.」

She points at the silver dragee as she explains.
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「I don't think I've heard of them much...」
Sora
「They're constellations in the Southern Hemisphere. You can't see them here in Japan.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「How... could I have know them...?」
I've been hoodwinked!
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Wait... Centaurus and Sagittarius are different?」
Sora
「They're different. Sagittarius was inspired by one of the wise centaurs, Chiron.」

％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Okay, then Centaurus just represent the other centaurs in general?」
Sora
「Centaurus is based on Pholus.」

％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Oh, is he also wise?」
Sora
「Pholus was a close friend of Heracles.」
Sora
「Once, Heracles fought a centaur tribe over a bottle of wine.」

Sora
「Heracles used the arrow dipped in the hydra's blood to drive them away.」

Sora
「Pholus took interest in the arrows that drove away the centaurs, so he collected them.」

Sora
「However, he was stuck in the leg when he dropped one.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Huh? And?」
Sora
「He died.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Pholus...」
Sora
「And so, watching above from Olympus, Zeus made him into a constellation.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「It's been a while since I last heard his name, but Zeus is a jerk.」
He's prety good at shaming others...
I feel myself sympathizing for the heroes of yore as I stare at the silver dragee making up the Centaurus constellation.

all
％Ｂ
「Hmm?」
I look down at the cake again and notice that some of the silver dragee are larger than the others.

They're right under the chocolate board.
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「And this is?」
Sora
「Tucana.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「I don't remember that one either... What is it again?」
Sora
「I's a bird with a large beak that lives in the south. It has a black body and colourful beak.」

％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Huh... that sounds familiar. And this bird got a constellation!?」

Sora
「Umhm. It's a new constellaion, so it's not based on myths.」 
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Those constellations exist...?」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「And what's with this silver dragee? 
Why is it sticking out so much?」
Sora
「Hehe...」
Sora
「The zeta star in the Tucana constellation is about 266 trillion kilometres from Earth.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「That's incredibly far away...」
Sora
「It's 28 light years away. Which means the light we see now was emitted when
Ryou was 
 you were 
 born!」
 
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Oh, that makes sense!」
Sora
「You can't see Tucana in Japan, but I thought I would recreate it here in this cake.」

％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「You've thought this one out. That makes me so happy...」
Sora
「
Ryou, you 
 You 
 did so much for my birthday too.」
Sora
「It's only fair if I do the same.」
Sora
「As long as you're satisfied, I am too.」
Sora breathes a sigh of relief from seeing my smile, as she returns one too.
I give my amazing girlfriend a kiss.
Sora
「Nn... Chuu...」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「I was able to talk about stars with you on my birthday this year.」

Sora
「We promised.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Spending time with you on my birthday is plenty.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「But looking at the stars together and listening to you talk about them...」
Sora
「Umhm」
Sora
「We promised.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Ah, you're right.」
It started as a small promise, but as time went on, it forged into strong bond between us.

Every time we celebrate our birthdays, that bonds only strengthens.

％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Thank you so much, Sora.」
Sora
「Umhm」
I give her another kiss.
