We welcome in the new year and three days pass.
I originally planned to start working yesterday, 
but I took Saturday off because of it being the weekend. 
And with today being Sunday, that means another day of rest for me. 
With that, I'm in the kitchen preparing a meal.
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「She should be coming soon.」
I look at the time and it's approaching noon.
I turn off the stove and check my LIME messages.
【Sora】「I'll be there soon」
【％Ｂ】「Sounds good」
【Sora】「Do you want me to buy you something?」
【％Ｂ】「It's fine, you don't have to」
【Sora】_st_0109
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Alright.」
Sora will be here soon.
All that's left is to tidy my room, then I'll be ready to greet her.
*Ding Dong*
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「T-that was quick!」
It hasn't even been 10 seconds since Sora's last message...
I can see Sora through the intercom as well.
Sora
「Happy new year.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Y-yeah, happy new year.」
We bow our heads and respectfully wish each other a happy new year.
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Didn't we already wish each other a happy new years on the phone?」

Sora
「I wanted to properly wish
Ryou 
 you 
a happy new year the first time I saw you in person.」
Sora
「It now feels like the new year has finally begun.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Yeah, seeing your face again makes me feel refreshed.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Oh yeah, and one more thing, Sora.」
Sora
「One more?」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Yeah, happy birthday, Sora.」
I give Sora the bouquet I prepared for her.
The bouquet has many Showy baby's-breaths of various size as well a few roses here and there.
Sora
「It's lovely...」
With the bouqeut in hand, Sora has a radiant smile on her face.
Sora
「I'm so glad... you make it look like the stars...」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Oh? You noticed it right away?」
Sora
「I can read 
Ryou's 
 your 
thoughts like a book.」
Sora takes a sniff and smiles.
Sora
「The Showy baby's-breaths are the whole galaxy while the rose makes up the Rosette Nebula in the Monoceros constellation.」
Sora
「Near the roses, the blue Showy baby's-breaths also trace out the shape of the Monoceros constellation.」
 
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「You really didn't miss a thing.」
Sora
「I'm still a planetarium navigator.」
She sticks out her chest in pride.
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「That was a bit cocky on my part, huh?」
Sora
「Haha... it's still wonderful.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「But there's still one thing you didn't notice.」
Sora
「Hmm?」
As I chuckle, Sora takes a second at the bouquet.
While she might think there's another constellation hidden in there, she probably won't notice the other thing.

Sora
「Huh? Hmm...? Tch...」
After staring at the bouquet, Sora gives me troubled expression.
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「I've been trying to stick to a particular type of Showy baby's-breath.」
Sora
「Type?」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「You've noticed the different sizes, yeah? There's Altair, Polaris, Antares and Pleiades. They're all types that are named after stars.」


Sora
「Wonderful... This really is a star-filled present.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「When I was searching for Showy baby's-breaths, I was surprised that there were so many named after stars. It's pretty neat.」

Sora
「There are more named after stars?」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「They have types like Starmine, Cassiopeia and the Milky Way. They even have the Million Star.」
Sora
「Wow...」
Her eyes are sparkling in amazement.
But she look down in dejection immediately afterwards.
Sora
「For a planetarium navigator to not even know this...」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「I mean, what can you do? This is all related to botany, not astronomy. I didn't even mean to learn about this.」

Sora
「I still feel inferior though...」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Knowing that I've one upped you in astronomy makes me a bit happy.」
Before I know it, I'm smiling.
With that, Sora tugs at my sleeve.
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Yeah?」
When I turn to her, her lips graze mine.
With the scent of bouquet drifting through the air, we share our first kiss of the new year.
Sora
「Nn... Chuu...」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「That was sudden.」
Sora
「I'm thanking you...」
Sora
「You always find a way to surprise me for my birthday. Thank you
, Ryou

.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「As long as you like it, I'm happy.」
This time, it's my turn to give Sora a kiss. 
Sora
「Chuu... Mm... Chuu...」
Sora
「Is this... also a present?」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「I was just thanking you. I'll give you a proper birthday kiss now.」
Sora
「Umhm」
She gives me a small, but delightful, nod. It only makes me love her even more.
Sora gently places the bouquet on the table and then hugs me.

Sora
「I have so many wishes...」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Yeah...」
I hug her tight and kiss her.
all
Before we know it, we make our way to the bed.
We indulge in our love for a while.
Sora
「We've been doing it since lunch...」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Well, it is our first time this year.」
Sora
「Huah～～～ It's been a wild new year already.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Did it feel good?」
Sora
「Umhm」
Sora
「You showed me so much love today 
, Ryou, 

because it was my birthday」
Sora
「You were more gentle than usual.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「You're making it sound like I'm usually never gentle.」
Sora
「Sometimes you can get too rough.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「That's also love.」
Sora
「That kind of love can be a bit difficult.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「You've been quite horny.」
Sora
「Tha's because of 
Ryou
 you
.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Looks like I've finally made your hidden side finally blossom.」
Sora
「You're making it sound like I was always horny.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「And you aren't?」
Sora
「Huah～～～」
She hit my arm over and over, but of course it doesn't hurt.
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Haha, you're cute when you're horny. That's part of the reason I love you so much!」
Sora
「Huah～～～ Augh～～～」
Sora blushes even more and continues beating my arm.
She's just too damn cute.
All of a sudden, I hear a quiet rumbling coming from her stomach.
The strikes to my arm cease as well.
Looking at Sora, she's hanging her head in shame. 
Sora
「Hngh～～～」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「You're also a big eater too, huh?」
Sora
「Hmm～～～！　Argh...」
She starts hitting my arm again.
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Alright, I'll get cooking. I'll make something light, since we have a reservation for that nice restaurant tonight.」

Sora
「Okay, then I'll make something.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「No, it's your birthday, Sora. You're the guest of honour today.」
Sora
「You're getting catering?」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「I made something. Hold on, I'll just put the finishing touches.」

Sora
「Umhm」
all
I put my clothes back on and head to the kichen to finish the meal I was making for Sora.
I oil the frying pan and and start frying the laid out ingredients.

％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Here you go, Sora.」
I return to the living room where I see Sora with her clothes on sitting at the seat of honour.
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「For you, a Hino style burger, with pickles removed.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「For you、a ％Ａ style burger, with pickles removed.」
I serve my homemade burger to Sora. 
To add some colour to the dish, I added a small salad as garnish.
Sora
「Ah...」
Sora's eyes are sparkling looking at the burger before her.
Sora
「Amazing... 
Ryou 
 you 
 made a burger...」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「I experimented countless times to make sure it fit your tastes.」
Sora
「Hehe...」
Sora
「Of course it'll be delicious.
Ryou 
you 
 made it after all.」
 
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Really? I'd like to hear your thoughts after you have a bite.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「If you have any criticisms, I'll be sure to implement them next time.」
Sora
「Wow... It looks so good though...」
Sora still has her mouth open as she ogles at the burger.
Being able to see her like this made it worth all the effort of making it. 
Sora
「Eating it would only defile it...」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「I'm glad to hear that, but you better eat it before gets cold.」
Sora
「Umhm」
Sora places her hands around the burgers as she begins steeling herself.
Sora
「Here I go.」
She gives me a quick bow as she sinks her teeth into the burger.

Sora
「Mgh... Ngh...」
She chews then promptly swallows.
She takes the next bite without a second thought.
Sora
「Mgh... Ngh...」
She closes her eyes as if she's soaking in the burger completely.
She swallows and bites into the burger again right away.

Sora
「Mgh... Ngh... Hngh, Agh.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Umm... Sora?」
Sora
「Ngh!」
Sora opens her eyes in shock after hearing my voice.
She quickly swallows and looks at me.
Sora
「It's so unbeliveable! 
I's the first time I had a burger this incredible!」
Sora
「It was so good, it was like I was in a daze.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Being able to make you this happy with my cooking is all the satification I need.」
Sora
「Hehe... I'm not just happy.」
Sora
「This is... pure bliss.」
Sora
「
Ryou's 
 your 
 cooking is pure bliss.」
Sora
「It's so good, I want to make this into a constellation.」
Sora
「And then I'll present it in planetarium.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「You'd go that far for my cooking? Anyways, how many stars will make up this constellation?」
Sora
「We'll use the whole sky! Three isn't enough!」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「You better get ready to eat the whole sky.」
Sora
「Teehee...」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「You better eat up before it gets cold. I even have seconds.」
Sora
「What about take out?」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「That's possbile.」
Sora
「And delivery?」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「If you want.」
Sora
「Umhm」
Sora
「But... eating with you makes it the most delicious.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Is that so?」
I take a seat beside Sora and grab my own burger.
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Alright, let's eat together.」
Sora
「Umhm」
Sora's eyes narrow, her face showing off a wide smile.
Night comes and Sora and I head to the restaurant we had reservations for. 
We were served quite the splendid meal.
The theme of the meal was related to the stars, as Sora's eyes glittered every time we were served a dish.

Sora
「I had so much wonderful food today..」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Your satisifcation is what's most important to me.」
I was successfully able to make Sora's birthday a special day and that makes me happy. 

％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Are you cold?」
We're at the park near the ocean and it's quite chilly.
Sora
「I'm fine... Besides...」
Sora looks up at the sky.
Sora
「The stars tonight are lovely.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Ah, you're right. The winter air so is dry, which makes the star shine that much more.」

Sora
「Umhm」
As she nods, Sora points her finger to the sky.
Sora
「There's Orion's star, Betelgeuse...」
Sora
「And over there is the blue-white giant Sirius from Canis Major. And by the upper left is Procyon of Canis Minor.」

％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「That's the Winter triangle.」
Sora
「Umhm」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Those were the stars you taught me when we were still in school.」
Sora
「You remember?」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Of course I do. We were on the rooftop waiting for the stars to come out. I also ate the cookie you made.」

％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「That's when you told me about those stars.」
Sora
「Umhm」
Sora
「
Ryou 
You 
 ate Sirius.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「I also ate the large Betelegeuse.」
Sora
「Back when... I remember my heart racing when my fingers touched
Ryou's 
 your 
 lips.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Really? You semeed so calm too. You sure your heart was racing?」
Sora
「Umhm」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Haha, so that's the truth from the past. That makes me happy.」
Sora
「Happy?」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Yeah. I'm glad I wasn't the only one who was nervous back then.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Knowing that makes me happy.」
Sora
「Ah... you're right...」
Sora
「Knowing that
Ryou was 
 you were 
 nervous too makes me happy too.」
Sora gives me bashful smile and grasps me hand.
Sora
「Thank you...」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「For what?」
Sora
「For bringing me to stars for my birthday again.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「No worries. For as many years possible, I'll make sure to watch the stars with you too.」
Sora
「Umhm」
all
I squeeze her hand back as I gaze at the sky above.
What greets me is the glitteirng stars, never changing in their nature.
I'll watch these stars with my beloved Sora, forever and always.
