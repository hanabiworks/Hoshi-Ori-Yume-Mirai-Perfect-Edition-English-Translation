It's finally time to start building the planetarium.
I've already looked up how to do it, and gathered up the materials.
All that's left is to actually try putting it together.
％Ｂ
「Let's just try making one, as a prototype.」
Misa
「I understand. What should we do?」


Sora
「...Star map. Copy the stars onto these hemispheres.」

Ousaka points to two acrylic hemispheres.
They're going to be the body of the planetarium.
Misa
「I see, I see. So once we cut holes into this and illuminate it from inside, the light will be projected outward as stars.」


％Ｂ
「You're very quick on the uptake, Okihara-senpai.」
all
Touko
「So this is... a map of stars? ...You're not saying we need to cut out for all of these stars, are you?」


Yukimura looks surprised.
I understand why. There's an enormous number of stars on the star map.

Sora
「...I drew lines on the major constellations. Those are absolutely necessary... and so are the planets and fixed stars with names written in... and also as many of the others as possible.」


Touko
「...So you're saying they're all absolutely necessary.」
％Ｂ
「It'll look better the more stars there are. But it won't be possible to do all of the stars on that map.」

all
We'll be making the holes larger for brighter stars, and smaller for dimmer ones.
I'm intending for us to use a drill to make the holes, but there's a limit to how big we can make them.

％Ｂ
「Stars of 4th magnitude and above are essential. For stars that are dimmer, just try to do as many as you can.」

Sora
「...You can see up to 4th magnitude stars in urban areas with the naked eye. There's no point in having a planetarium with fewer stars.」


Marika
「That's true. It'd be disappointing if there were even fewer stars than you could normally see by going outside.」

％Ｂ
「So please do your best getting at least the stars that are 4th magnitude and above.」

all
Touko
「Yeah, yeah, fiiine.」

Misa
「Then Yukimura-san and I will attempt it, with Ousaka-san's supervision.」

％Ｂ
「Please do. Shinozaki and I will be in charge of the support and the light bulb.」

Touko
「I see, already getting to work on your first team activity, eh?」
all
Marika
「Oh, we already...」
Shinozaki starts to give a serious answer to Yukimura's teasing.
She must be referring to the watermelon splitting.
But what would others think if they heard that...

Touko
「Huh? Already...? Wait, have you two already...?」

She's not having some kinda weird misunderstanding, is she?
Marika
「...Already what?」
Though it looks like Shinozaki doesn't get it.
Touko
「I see～ You're actually pretty quick about stuff like that.」
％Ｂ
「S-Stop it. Don't jump to weird conclusions! We're not like that yet...」

Sora
「...Yet?」
Marika
「Like what?」
％Ｂ
「W-Well, uh... A-Anyway, the planetarium! No time for chit-chat!」

Touko
「Yes, yeees. Hehe.」
％Ｂ
「Phew. I'm tired...」
Marika
「Looks like we ended up helping with the starmaking.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, that seemed like it was more work.」
None of us were particularly used to doing anything like that, and there were just a ton of stars.

Marika
「What are we going to do about the support and the light source?」
％Ｂ
「I guess I'll just have to do it at home.」
Marika
「I'll help out too, then. I can come over after this, right?」

％Ｂ
「Right now? But it's already pretty late. It's dark out.」

Marika
「Don't worry, I'll let my parents know. I'm sure my mom won't be worried if it's your house.」

Marika
「Don't worry, I'll let my parents know. I'm sure my mom won't be worried if it's your house.」

Marika
「I'll try calling them now.」
％Ｂ
「All right...」
Is... that really the case?
all
Shinozaki ended up coming over.
Her mom apparently immediately said it was okay.
She was told that she should come home first to change into normal clothes, so her uniform wouldn't get dirty.

Marika
「But she said I should come home before my dad comes home.」
％Ｂ
「Your dad, huh... We'll have to make sure we follow what your mom says, then.」
Marika
「Let's get started then!」
％Ｂ
「Yeah.」
all
And after working for a while...
Marika
「Wow, it's so pretty～!」
Our homemade light source turns on.
Though of course I bought the light bulb itself from a store, so it wasn't actually anything difficult to put together.

％Ｂ
「All that's left to see is how it actually projects the stars.」
As for whether this'll be enough light... We won't know for sure until we actually try it out.

Marika
「But, you know... it kind of sets the mood.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, it does.」
The warm-colored light illuminates the room.
The light's still relatively dim, so it's filling the room with a completely different ambiance.

％Ｂ
「Hm...」
I feel warmth on my arm. Shinozaki's leaned against me.

Marika
「...」
I can feel her nervousness through her skin.
And my heart's beating so hard I feel like I can hear it in my ears.
This is incredibly comfortable.
But I want to feel her closer.
Much, much closer...
％Ｂ
「Shinozaki...」
I say her name as I pull her closer.
Marika
「Oh...」
She makes a sound, but she doesn't resist.
She easily allows herself to fall into my arms.
Marika
「Hauh...」
She looks up from within my embrace.
We stare into each other's eyes, close enough to feel the other breathing.
％Ｂ
「Shinozaki...」
And then we find ourselves kissing.
Marika
「Amh... nh...」
I feel like her lips have a nice, sweet smell to them.
And they're really smooth, and unbelievably soft.
I want to taste them forever, but my breath's running out fast from how nervous I am. I pull away.

Marika
「Ah, nh... hahhh...」
Shinozaki's shoulders are heaving up and down like mine.
Her face is bright red.
％Ｂ
「Sorry, that was sudden.」
Marika
「Huh? N-No, it's okay... It made me happy.」
％Ｂ
「D-Did it?」
Marika
「Of course it did... because... I wanted to kiss you too, Hino-kun...」

Marika
「Of course it did... because... I wanted to kiss you too...」

％Ｂ
「Shinozaki...」
We kiss once more, neither one really being the one to initiate.
Marika
「Amh... mmh...」
I want to get closer and closer.
I kiss her deeper.
I feel like her scent's pouring into me.
It's different from the smell of soap or shampoo...
I didn't know girls smelled this good.
Marika
「Aah... Hahh, nh... aah...」
We pull away again when we can't hold our breaths anymore.
Her face is completely flushed.
That bashful expression. Those wettened eyes. Those lips glistening with our saliva. They're all just so precious to me.

％Ｂ
「Marika...」
I call her by first name without thinking.
Marika
「Wha...」
Shinozaki looks surprised.
％Ｂ
「Is it weird if I call you that?」
Marika
「N-No, it's not weird at all! ...It'd make me happy if you did it more～」

％Ｂ
「Really? Then... Marika.」
Marika
「...Yes.」
％Ｂ
「Marika.」
Marika
「Mhm... What is iiit?」
％Ｂ
「You're just so cute, Marika.」
Marika
「...Th-That's not true... geez...」
And the way Marika turns red and looks downward is, of course, cute.
％Ｂ
「Marika...」
Marika
「Aahn...」
I pull her into my arms again.
Her soft chest presses against mine.
My heart starts thumping.
The more I try not to think about her breasts, the more I do.\n\r

And I can't ignore them any longer.
Marika
「My heart... is beating so fast...」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Me too. My chest is pounding.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Hey, Marika...」
Marika
「Huh? W-what～...?」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「I want to feel... your heartbeat...」
Marika
「Sure... Take a listen...」
Marika responds with a feeble voice. Blushing like crazy, she turns away embarrassed. 

Marika
「Ah...」
I place my hand over her chest.
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Wow... it's so clear.」
Marika
「Y-yeah～ I mean, the person I love is right beside me.」

Marika
「My chest is beating so much... it might burst.」
Marika
「I love you so much...」
She stares at me with moist, blazing eyes.
Each pulse goes directly from her right to me.
％Ｂ
「...」
I gently reach out toward them.
Marika
「Oh...」
Marika shivers for a moment when my fingertip touches her.\n \n\r

But she doesn't try to run away, nor does she say no.
％Ｂ
「Marika...」
I try gently massaging her breast.
Marika
「Fuaah, nh... Ryousuke-kun... Nnnh...」
Marika
「Fuaah, nh... kh, fhh... Nnnh...」
Marika says my name as she moans.
I could swear I could feel her temperature rise in my arms.
And I feel like that sweet scent's gotten stronger.
I slowly rub her breast, dizzy from the heat and fragrance.

Marika
「Aahn, nh... hyahn, nh... a-aahh...」
The way she makes those cute moans in time with the movement of my hand is just so adorable.

Before I know it, I'm almost painfully hard.
Marika
「Huh? ...Oh...」
And it looks like Marika's noticed that change too.
％Ｂ
「Oh, uh... this is...」
Marika
「...It's okay.」
Her voice sounds like it might disappear.
Marika
「If it's you, Ryousuke-kun... then it's okay.」
Marika
「If it's you... then it's okay.」
％Ｂ
「Marika...」
...My body flushes hot.
But there's a part of me that's still rational, thinking, "Is it really okay to continue like this?"


％Ｂ
「...Sorry.」
And I loosen my arms around Marika.
Marika
「H-Haeh...?」
％Ｂ
「Sorry. I got ahead of myself. But we can't do this today, right?」

Marika
「...Why not?」
％Ｂ
「'Cause, you know... We've only just started dating... Well, I guess that might not really matter...」

％Ｂ
「But I don't have any... condoms... or contraceptives right now...」
Marika
「Oh...」
She goes red again at those words.
％Ｂ
「We gotta make sure we do our due diligence with that stuff... I think that's my responsibility as a man. I care about you.」

I don't want her to have to worry about things like that.
If we're gonna do it, then I want to prepare properly, to put Marika at ease.
Marika
「Thank you... That makes me happy.」
Tears well up in her eyes.
％Ｂ
「D-Don't cry... It's the obvious thing to do, isn't it?」
Marika
「Yeah, I'm so happy... I'm... just so glad I fell in love with you.」

％Ｂ
「It-It isn't that big of a deal.」
Marika
「No, it is. I love you!」

％Ｂ
「Mm...」
This time, Marika starts the kiss.
I can't believe she's acting this boldly...
But it makes me crazy happy.
Marika
「Oh... Sorry, just a second...」
all
％Ｂ
「Huh? Marika?」
Marika suddenly leaves my room at a frantic pace.
She grabs her bag before leaving.
Marika
「I-I'm going to borrow your bathroom for a second!」
％Ｂ
「Huh? The bathroom?」
$$smh_OpenCHK
Marika
「U-Umm... S-So.」
She comes back looking embarrassed, and raises her hand just a bit.
％Ｂ
「Y-Yes, Marika-san.」
Marika
「...It appears I'm on my period.」
...Is what that was all about, apparently.
％Ｂ
「R-Really...」
I've never had a girl talk to me about periods before, so I have absolutely no idea how to respond.\n\r

It was something that had nothing at all to do with me up until now...
But I guess things are different now.
Marika
「So it looks like today was no good either way.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. Good thing we decided not to.」
Marika
「Yeah, it was. But...」

Marika turns bright red and stops herself from continuing.
％Ｂ
「Y-Yeah, well...」
I can kinda guess at what she was about to say, but I make my response just as vague.

Marika
「But... we can kiss as much as we want, right?」
％Ｂ
「Oh...」
Marika
「Mmh... Chu...」
％Ｂ
「Marika... Mh...」
And so we begin kissing once more.

With the closing ceremony behind us, today marks the first day of summer break.
That being said, we have little time to waste.
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Let's see how this works... Hmph...」
Almost immediately, we head to the old building to work on the planetarium again.
It took a lot of blood, sweat and tears, but we're nearing the end.
I feel surge of energy, willing me to complete this.
It really is so much fun being able to create something.
And it's even better when I get to do it with everyone else.
Well, with the way things are, I'm all alone, but...
Marika
「Sorry to keep you waiting～...」
As if right on cue, Marika makes her appearance.
She's tired and worn out.
Marika
「Sorry I'm late～ Huh?　There's no one else here...」

％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Segawa has stuff with the yearbook committee, and Okihara and Ousaka have some stuff with their clubs.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「I mean, summer break's right around the corner, so I'd imagine they have stuff to do.」

％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Yukimura and Narusawa... well, they should be coming by soon enough.」
Marika
「Oh, okay. But good thing I rushed over. That way, I can help!」

％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Thanks a bunch. How about you bring me that pipe over there?」
Marika
「Alright～」
all
Marika sets down her bag and starts helping out.
She brings me the pipe in her dainty hands.
I continue working, with Marika as my support.
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「You know, homeroom felt so long today.」
Marika
「Yeah for sure. They talked for so long about do and don'ts.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「I mean your homeroom teacher was also a counselor once.」
Marika
「Yeah, but I'm a good kid, you know～ I don't even go out at night...」

Marika
「What about you, Ryousuke?」
Marika
「What about you?」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Hmm, good question. I usually don't go out at night.」

％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「But if it's not dangerous, it's not like doing it once or twice will hurt, yeah?」

Marika
「Like, what do you mean?」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Like going to a friend's house... or your boyfriend's house...」
Marika
「Wah～ That's so improper...」
She blushes as if she's imagining something.
She said it was improper and all, but she looks like she's enjoying it a bit.
Marika
「I'd have to keep that a secret... from my family.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Y-yeah, you're right. Probably a good idea to keep that a secret.」

Marika
「Yeah... I might become a naughty girl... What should I do～...」

I stare at the pipe in my hands. 
Hearing her say that make  sme realy happy.
Marika
「But now that I think about it... I might already be naughty...」
Marika
「I mean, I secretly went to your house the other day...」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「You sure did...」
I recall when she went to my house the other day.
We worked on the planetarium, we kissed, and then...
My heart is pounding thinking back on that.
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Oh yeah, umm... how is your body doing?」

Marika
「Well...」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「You're on your period, yeah? I heard that's pretty painful...」
Marika
「Ah, I'm all good～ I felt a bit slumpy yesterday, but I'm all good today!」


％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Oh yeah, that's good to hear.」
Marika
「Thanks for worrying...」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「I mean, I heard some stories here and there like how some people can't move, but as a guy, I'm pretty ignorant on these things.」

Marika
「I'm fine. I can move and all. Oh, but I sometimes get really hungry...」

Marika
「I ate two cups of pudding for dessert yesterday...」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「That's a lot for you.」
Marika
「Yeah. I've been losing weight, so maybe I should eat more...」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Losing weight...? Have you been dieting?」
Marika
「Oh, not at all～...」
Marika
「It's because... from now on... I'll have more chances to take my clothes off...」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Ah...」
I instantly stop what I'm doing.
So it really is about that, huh...
Marika
「Umm... you know, I'll be wearing my bikini more too, so there's that...」

Marika
「H-here! I'm holding it done for you, so you can start working on it!」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「S-sure thing.」
As if to distract ourselves, we turn our complete attention on the planetarium.

all
Natsuki
「Sorry for the wait!」
Marika
「Ah, Segawa.」
all
Misa
「I'm finished with my business as well! Let me help out!」
Sora
「The planetarium is calling for me...」
With Segawa leading the way, everyone comes in.
all
Touko
「Sorry for barging in on your lovey-dovey time.」
Rikka
「I saw you guys in the hallways, so I thought I would follow. I didn't mean to interrupt.」
all
Natsuki
「Ah, now hat you say that, you two were here the whole time. And the look on your faces too.」

Natsuki
「I can't believe I missed the chance to snap a pic like this.」
Clearly a bit vexed, Segawa makes a frame with her fingers and points it towards us.

all
Touko
「I agree that something does seem a litle different than usual.」
Marika
「Ahaha... what do you mean～?」
Touko
「There's just something so liberating about summer break. I mean, it's always the pirm and proper types that have the darkest secrets.」

Marika
「It's not like that～... I'm always well behaved.」
Marika
「Come on everyone, let's start working on the planetarium!」
all
Sora
「Yeah... We don't have time for idle chit-chat.」
Marika
「Y-yeah, Ousaka.」
Sora
「But, I am a bit interested...」
Misa
「I feel the same way.」
Marika
「Come on you two, it's nothing～...」
Our embarrassment is hidden between playful jests.
all
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Alright, let's get working!」
We shift our focus from an awkward subject to the planetarium.

Touko
「Hmm...」
But instead of the liberation of summer break, we're currently experiencing a strange sense of disappointment.


Natsuki
「It's not reeeally that impressive, is it?」
And that's because the prototype planetarium we've finally finished putting together doesn't really pack much of a punch.

％Ｂ
「Yeah...」
all
The starry sky being projected onto the classroom ceiling's a far cry from the breathtaking sight that we had expected.\n\r

First off, there's a shockingly small number of stars.
Rikka
「About how many stars is this right now?」

Sora
「...Magnitude 4 and above, so about five hundred.」
％Ｂ
「So this is five hundred stars...」
all
It was a ton of work making all those holes for five hundred stars.
But from the looks of it, five hundred won't be even close to enough.
％Ｂ
「What do we have to do if we wanna project more stars?」
Sora
「...We have to open lots of pinholes. We'll have to make the main structure bigger for that.」


Misa
「That's true... At this size, I believe that what we have currently may be the limit for the biggest holes we could make.」

％Ｂ
「I get it. So we just need to make it bigger.」
all
It's simple logic. Making it bigger means more surface area, which means more room for more holes.

Sora
「...If we make it bigger, then we need a correspondingly brighter light.」
％Ｂ
「That makes sense... Wait. So that means this isn't even close to bright enough.」

I thought it might be a little too dim even for our current setup, but we're going to need it to be even brighter.\n\r

Looks like there's still a mountain of issues ahead of us.
all
Marika
「But now we know what we need to do.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. We'll make the whole thing bigger and go from less than a thousand stars to ten thousand. And we'll need to switch to an even brighter light source.」


％Ｂ
「...Which is easier said than done.」
Marika
「But I'm sure we'll be able to do it if we all work together! And summer break starts tomorrow!」

Misa
「That's right. There's still time.」
Touko
「Weeell, we've more or less figured out how to actually make it now, so all that we need now is time and perseverance.」

Everyone looks optimistic.
％Ｂ
「All right! Then let's all work together and do this!」
all
％Ｂ
「I'm done with the cleaning!」
Azuma
「Man, you're a huge help with how neat you do it.」
I dropped by the architectural firm after the closing ceremony and volunteered to clean up.
It's the least I could do to thank him for the water tank caulk.
Azuma
「Maybe I should employ you as a legitimate janitor?」
％Ｂ
「Please employ me as an architect if you're willing to hire me.」
Azuma
「Ahahah, yeah, fair enough. So, you been making something lately?」

％Ｂ
「Oh, well actually...」
I pull out the rough sketch of the stargazing aquarium.
％Ｂ
「This is the concept image for the stargazing aquarium I was talking about before. Could I have you take a look at it?」

Azuma
「Now let's see here... Hoh. This is better put together than I expected.」
Mr. Azuma smiles the moment he looks it over.
I'm relieved to see that he seems to like it.
％Ｂ
「I don't know if we'll be able to get it to come out exactly like this...」

Azuma
「Of course you don't. If you could do that by just thinking about it, then you wouldn't need knowledge, skills, or experience.」

Azuma
「But to imagine is to create. It's impossible to give form to something unimaginable, but if you can imagine it, then no matter how hard it might be, it's still possible to make it real.」


Azuma
「...That's my personal philosophy, at least.」
％Ｂ
「If you can imagine it, then you can make it real...」
It's kind of a revelation to me.
It means that I can definitely make my thoughts into reality.
％Ｂ
「That's so inspiring! I need to write that down...」
Azuma
「By the way, are you going to keep the floor like that?」
％Ｂ
「The floor? I didn't have any particular plans for it...」
Azuma
「Hmm, that'd be a waste. You've got an ocean of fish tanks surrounding you, a full night sky of stars above you, but when you look down it's just some classroom floor?」

Azuma
「It's the only hole in your immersive experience. It'd be a bit of a killjoy to get dragged back into reality once you looked down.」


％Ｂ
「D-Do you think so?」
Firm Staff A
「Mr. Azuma, this is a student's design, right? It's impressive enough that he planned all of this out. Don't you think it'd be expensive to redo the floor?」


Firm Staff B
「And it might come out a bit cheap-looking if he were to use some kind of makeshift floor covering...」

％Ｂ
「That's true. It's not like it'd be fine if we just laid out some painted cardboard or something...」

Azuma
「Isn't there some kind of no-cost option?」
Firm Staff A
「Well let's see... Oh, how about you project something onto the floor as well?」
％Ｂ
「Huh? Project onto the floor?」
Firm Staff B
「Oh, like a symbol spotlight. Maybe you could use some of those to project something like waves.」

Azuma
「Hm, that's a good idea. It'll be safer if you illuminate the floor too. But it'll take away from the planetarium if it's too bright.」


Firm Staff A
「That's true. You'd have to think about where you'd want to project from. You'd need to at least make sure that the light doesn't reach above the knees.」

Firm Staff B
「Then how about projecting in a line along the paths? That way, you could project from a lower position. As for the actual light placement... You could go for a shallow angle around here, and...」


Firm Staff A
「Maybe he should make the BGM the sound of ocean waves while he's at it.」
Azuma
「No, don't you think it should be something more star-related? I've heard of stuff like "Whispers of the Stars" before. It sounds crisp and refreshing. Not a bad image.」


Firm Staff B
「Then maybe...」
This is... kinda amazing!
It's just one idea after another!
It was just supposed to be some casual conversation about some stranger's design, a student's at that. But everyone's really into it!

So this is what it's like to be a professional.
I wanna work alongside people like this one day.
But to be able to do that, I need to make sure this stargazing aquarium's a success.
