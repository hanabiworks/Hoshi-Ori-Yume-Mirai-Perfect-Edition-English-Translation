「...Sigh.」
Marika
「What are you sighing for? You passed your exams.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, I did... but applying for the license cost a lot of money.」

Marika
「Whaaat～? How much?」
％Ｂ
「I've gotta get a local architectural guild to issue me a license... and it's gonna cost about 100,000 yen.」


Marika
「What!? It's that expensive!? Are you okay～ Are you sure that isn't some evil architectural guild～?」

％Ｂ
「An evil architectural guild...? It's the same all across the country. It's a national qualification.」


Marika
「Really. That's so expensive...」
％Ｂ
「And with all the prep school and textbooks... and the cost of taking the exams themselves, it's probably more than 100,000 in total.」

Marika
「It's rough even when you pass...」
％Ｂ
「I'm on the luckier side, since I passed on my first try, but it's still pretty harsh.」

％Ｂ
「That's why, uh... it's pathetic, but...」
I open up my bankbook.
Marika
「Oh no... You don't have any savings.」
％Ｂ
「Sorry I'm so lame.」
Marika
「Ahaha, I'm not worried about that at all～」
％Ｂ
「But getting married costs money too...」
Marika
「I don't think we need to spend that much money, you know.」
％Ｂ
「No, we can't do that. It's a once-in-a-lifetime thing.」

And the wedding ceremony's probably especially important for a girl.
A pretty wedding dress, a gorgeous ceremony, and a luxurious honeymoon...

Marika
「It really doesn't have to be so extravagant. I'm okay with a simple ceremony.」

％Ｂ
「But...」
Marika
「The wedding ceremony isn't what I want. What I want is to be your bride, Ryousuke.」

Marika
「The wedding ceremony isn't what I want. What I want is to be your bride.」

％Ｂ
「Marika...」
She just smiles quietly.
She's definitely not just saying that.
I can tell from that smile that she really means it.
But hearing something like that just makes me feel like I really need to get it together.

Marika
「And I actually have a lot saved up, you know. It's not like we're going to have the ceremony right away... so let's save up together, bit by bit.」


％Ｂ
「You're right. I'll save up and try my best too.」
Marika
「And so... Tada!」
Marika pulls out a box from the shopping bag she brought.
It's a big can.
It says "Let's save up 100,000 yen" on it.
％Ｂ
「A savings box?」
Marika
「Yeah. Let's save up money for our marriage in this, okay? We can put the small change we have left over at the end of the day in this.」

She happily places the can in the entranceway.
Marika
「I'll put money in here when I come over too.」
％Ｂ
「Okay, got it. I'll fill that thing up in no time.」
Marika
「Ahaha, you don't have to try too hard. Let's do it nice and slow.」

I need to hurry up and get it together... is what I think, but Marika's really calm and composed compared to me.\n\r

She even looks like she's enjoying our current situation.
Just seeing her like that gets me to calm down too.
％Ｂ
「I'm glad I fell in love with you, Marika.」
Marika
「Huh? Why so suddenly...?」
％Ｂ
「Nah, I just really felt that way just now.」
Marika
「Whaaat? That just makes me more embarrassed... I'll make some tasty food today, then! Just a minute～」


all
She rolls up her sleeves and heads toward the kitchen.
Honestly, she's wasted on me as a girlfriend... as a bride.
Marika
「Can I use the stuff in fridge?」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Sure, get what you want.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「That being said... I don't think I have anything good in there.」
Marika
「Looks like you've been eating out a lot.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Yeah, I mostly pick something up at the convenience store for lunch... and I usually head to the ramen place by the office for dinner.」

Marika
「Ahaha～ Seems like you've been really busy.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「At the very least, I try to make sure to have a healthy breakfast.」

all
Marika
「Yeah, there's a lot of breakfast foods in the fridge.」
Marika
「Seems like you have milk and egg... there's not a lot though.」
Looks like Marika is carefully analyzing everything in the fridge.
She has all the ingredients out of the fridge and lined up on the counter.
Marika
「There's also ham and bacon... but will it be enough?」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「You better not use up all of it.」
That's the pain of living alone...
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Besides that, what else do you have?」
Marika
「There's some coked pasta and some onions as well.」

％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Ah, I made some pasta last week when I was off.」
Marika
「Oh yeah? How did you make it?」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「I cooked it with shimeji and bacon and fried it with mentsuyu and soy sauce. It's nice and easy.」

Marika
「Ah, is that the dish I made before?」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Oh yeah, you did.」
I remember when Marika came over and made exactly that for me for lunch.
Marika
「I mean, it's delicious～ And using butter pairs well with soy sauce.」

Marika
「Anyways... I hope there's some butter left somewhere.」
all
Realizing the current situation, Marika start digging deep into the fridge.
Marika
「Ah, butter! You have some left～!」
Her face is sparkling, as if she found a precious jewel.
Marika
「I think I should be fine with these ingredidents.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Really? I can go out and buy something.」
Marika
「It's fine～ Leave it to me!」
Marika
「Oh, I'm borrowing an apron.」
all
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Alright, I'll let you handle everything.」
She really knows every nook and corner of my apartment.
She takes the apron out of the closet and gets ready.
When I moved out, I wondered if I needed one, so I bought it just in case.
I ended up never using it anyways...
So now that apron is basically Marika's.

Marika
「Alright, let's get cooking!」
With the slightly oversized apron on her, she rolls up her sleeves.
The ribbon tying the apron on her back starts fluttering as she begins cooknig right away.
I'll never get tired of looking at her like this.
Marika
「Tada! It's all ready!」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Oh!」
I patienly waited for about ten minutes.
A rich aroma drifts from the kitchen.
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Holy shit!」
Glittering in front of me is a golden plate of food.
Marika
「I made omelette rice.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「It looks so damn good...」
Marika
「No way～ The edges are a bit burnt... I should have been more quick with frying it.」

％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Sure, it's a bit burnt, but who cares? It still looks delicious.」


Marika
「Really～?　That makes me happy. I guess I should thank my mom for teaching me a lot.」

Marika
「And I have one more dish afterwards. I made some soup.」
Marika
「I put some canned tomato for flavouring, so it's basically a tomato soup.」

％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Oa yeah, I think I remember buying that before.」
Marika
「Canned foods take a long time before they go bad, so it's all good.」
Marika
「But some of the tomatoes were already poured out... so I ended up adding some ketchup to the soup...」

％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Well, tomatos are good for you.」
Marika
「Ahaha, that's true～」
Marika
「Alright, here. Here's a spoon and some tea.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Thanks. Time to dig in!」
Marika
「Hope you like it～」
I put some of the ketchup covered omelette into my mouth.
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Ah, it's delicious!」
Marika
「Really? That's good to hear～」
The rice is thoroughly coated and fried in butter 
as I also taste the sweetness of the onion and ham.
But most of all...
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「The egg is really light and fluffy. It's basically restaurant quality.」

Marika
「The trick is to add a bit of milk to the egg before cooking.」
Marika
「That way, it won't harrden and it'll end up being all fluffy.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Oh, I see... Yeah, this is the shit. And the soup is... Tsh...」

％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「The tomtao soups feels strangely rich for some reason.」
Marika
「It's my secret ingredient, grated cheese.」
Marika
「Cheese and tomato go well together and really bring out each other's flavour.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「This is the best, like I have no words...」
Marika
「Ehehe...」
I continue devouring my meal, without giving myself time to pasue.
Marika is seemingly content with watching me eat.
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「You know, I feel kinda bad for being the only one eating here...」
Marika
「Don't worry, it's fine.」
Marika
「I can eat when I get home. Otherwise we won't be together.」

Marika
「Besides, it's so much fun watching you eat and rave about the food.」

％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Yeah, you said that before.」
Marika
「Yeah, I'm a small eater anyways.」
Marika
「That why I want to watch you eat a lot. It makes all the effort worth it.」

％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「I get you, but you know...」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Aren't you hungry, Marika?」
Marika
「Ah, well... a bit.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Have a bite then. It's so damn good, in my opinion.」

Marika
「A-are you sure? Well, if you don't mind.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Come on, open you mouth.」
Marika
「Ah...」
She scoops up some of the omelette rice and puts it in her small mouth.
She closes her eyes a bit, as if to soak in the flavours.
Marika
「It's good～」
Her face instantly lights up.
Marika
「Thanks for letting me have a bite～」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「I mean, you made it yourself.」
Marika
「Ahaha, you're right. It feels weird though.」
Marika
「But I'm glad I was able to make something good.」
all
With that, I continue eating as Marika and I exchange cordial banter.
And finally...
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Thanks for the meal!」
The plate is spick and span. 
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「That was so good, Marika.」
Marika
「You're welcome.」
She promptly clean the dishes.
I'm grateful for everything she's done.
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「If I'll be able to eat food this delicious, I am so looking forward to marriage.」

Marika
「Now that my cooking skills have gotten better, I'll be able to listen to any requests you have.」

％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Thank you so much. I know that cooking for me too is a huge time sink.」

Marika
「Not at all! I love doing it!」
Marika
「Being able to cook for the man I love is a special feeling.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Really?」
Marika
「Yeah, I mean, wouldn't you want to put your all into making something amazing?」
Marika
「I guess that's what love does to you.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「And I'll make sure to tell you that it's delicious.」
Marika
「I'll look forward to it～...」
Being able to spend my days with Marika by my side...
It feels like my joy has increased twofold.
I think I finally understand what that entails.
