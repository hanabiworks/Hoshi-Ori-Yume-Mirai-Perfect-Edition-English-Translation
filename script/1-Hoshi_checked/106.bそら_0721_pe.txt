Today's our first day of work.
Sora and I go to the office of the local chamber of commerce again at 9 a.m., like we were told.

Staff
「Hey, morning.」
％Ｂ
「Good morning.」
Sora
「...Good morning.」
Staff
「I'm looking forward to working with you two starting today. Could you get changed right away?」

％Ｂ
「Oh, yes.」
I guess we're going to be given the uniforms we were measured for when we were here before.
I think I might kinda like the idea of working with Sora while wearing matching uniforms...

all
％Ｂ
「...」
I stand there, mouth agape, looking at myself in the mirror.
I guess it'd be more accurate to say that it isn't me in the mirror.
I'm looking at the mascot costume I'm currently inside.
And─
There's a cat next to me too. Sora's inside that one.
Staff
「Oh, looks like they were just the right size! You two look great!」

all
％Ｂ
「Um... What are these...?」
Staff
「They're the unofficial mascots we created for Shionagi. They're named "Shio-wan" and "Shio-nyah"!」

％Ｂ
「...Shio...wan, I see...」
So this dog with singular horizontal lines for eyes... is Shio-wan.
Sora
「...Nyah...」
And that the cat with those hollow eyes must be Shionyan.
I remember drawing this character in the lottery earlier.
Sora was enraptured by said keychain so it's now hanging on her bag...
And now I'm face to face with its life sized figure.
I mean, I knew it was this market's mascot and all..
Seems like Shionyan（Sora） is enjoying the star on her stomach.
And she's caressing it...
Don't tell me that this job is growing on Sora.
Staff
「Alright, I'll give you the rundown.」
all
It's just as Sora said, we'll be in charge in of reception.
We'll be wearing these costumes and enticing customers with the market's various campaigns.
Looks like we'll have breaks every 30 minutes.
However, if things start to get dire, we can signal to the staff nearby.
Heatstroke is pretty much the only thing we have to worry about.
And so...
When we wear the costumes, we have to become the characters.
Shiowan is cautious and always moves in slow motion.
For Shiowan, time moves at a lackadaisical pace.
I can feel myself becoming one with Shiowan, but it's probably just due to gravity.
Shionyan is an apathetic cat, but when it receives praise, it collapses from embarrassment.


％Ｂ
「We have to stay in character...」
Sora
「...」
I have to move in slow motion and Sora has to collapse every time she receives praise.
I can barely see, it's so hot in here and my neck is completely strained.
With her low constitution and all, I hope Sora can keep up. 

％Ｂ
「You think you'll be fine. Sora?」
Sora
「Yeah...」
Shionyan gives me a thumbs up.
I can see her face, but I can imagine a blissful smile on Sora's face. For some reason that catches me off guard...

Staff
「I'll let you two have at it then.」
Sora... or Shionyan, I should say, and I head out to the market.
It looks like we're startling the people who come here for some light shopping.
That comes as no surprise...
How many people even know these mascots even exist...?
Will we be even able to promote the market's campaigns with these costumes?


Little Boy
「Oh, it's Shionyan and Shiowan!」
Wait what!?
Someone knows us!?
Little Boy
「Shionyan!　Shiowan!」
A boy rushes up when he sees us.
Okay, umm... Gotta move slow here...
Shiowan
「...」
I pat his head as slowly as I can.

Little Girl
「Mama, I see Shionyan!」
And now a girl and her mom are here.
Little Girl
「Shionyan, let's shake hands!」
Shionyan
「...」
Sora shakes hands with her.
Little Girl
「Shionyan, you're cute!」
Shionyan
「...」
all
After hearing such praise, Shionyan covers up its face in eambarrassment and falls down.
That's a pretty convincing fall. What a hidden talent.

Little Boy
「Shiowan, let's take a picture together!」
As slowly as possible, I give him an okay sign.
I can not talk at all and the only way I can communicate is through these slow gestures.
This might be a bigger problem than initially anticipated...
Half an hour passed and we return to Chamber of Commerce building for our break. 
I remove the headpiece.


％Ｂ
「Fuah... Ha... Ha... Heh...」
My body is drenched in sweat.
I look at Sora and she's in the same boat as me.
Sora
「It's hot...」
％Ｂ
「Are you fine?」
Sora
「Umhm」
I give her a bottle of water.
％Ｂ
「So this is what's it's like working reception...」
Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「Yeah?」
Sora is staring at me intently.
％Ｂ
「what's wrong?」
Sora
「Hauh...」
Sora blushes and turns away...
％Ｂ
「Uh, what?」
Sora
「It's nothing...」
Sora's acting a bit weird.
％Ｂ
「If you want to say something, just say it.」
Sora
「It's just that 
Ryou,
,
right now...」
％Ｂ
「Go on.」
Sora
「It's like after sex...」
％Ｂ
「What?」
Like after sex?
％Ｂ
「You mean because of all the sweat?」
Sora
「Umhm」
％Ｂ
「I'm that sweaty?」
Sora
「…Umhm」
％Ｂ
「Damn... I was not expecting that at all.」
Anyways, I get a towel to wipe off the sweat.
％Ｂ
「Hey Sora, come here, I'll wipe your face too.」
Sora
「Okay.」
Sora comes over and I wipe of her sweat too.
She closes her eyes like a kitten and entrusts her body to me. 
Her face is red from the heat.
She's definitely giving off the post-sex vibes...
％Ｂ
「Alright, all good.」
Sora
「...」
She opesn her eyes and stares at me.
Out of nowhere, we draw closer to each other and kiss.
Sora
「Nn... Hmm... Nnh...」
Today's kiss felt a bit salty.
all
We finish our first day of work with no further issues and head back to school.
Marika
「Ah, good job you two!」
Misa
「Good job on the hard work!」
Both of them arrived holding cardboard the same time as us. 
％Ｂ
「Thanks. How did collecting go today?」
Marika
「It went well I guess.」
all
Marika
「I should be asking you how your job went.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah... it's more demanding that I thought.」
Marika
「Makes sense. So what kind of stuff do you do in reception?」

％Ｂ
「Well...」

Before I can answer, Sora is incessantly tugging at my shirt.
％Ｂ
「Huh?」
Sora
「...」
She's staring at me.
all
％Ｂ
「Well, um... We have to promote the market's campaigns and attract customers... and we have to walk out in heat the whole day.」


Marika
「Wow, that does sound hard.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, for sure....」

Misa
「Marika, I shall go check up on the fish tanks.」
Marika
「Oh, I'll get going too. See you two later.」
％Ｂ
「S-sure...」
all
％Ｂ
「Why didn't you want me to tell about our job?」
Sora
「If our friends see us, it'll be embarrassing. 
If we say anything, they'll come and look.」
％Ｂ
「You have a point. Segawa will definitely use that chance to snap a pic.」

％Ｂ
「Oh yeah, about our pay...」
all
I take the envelope out of my pokcet.
Inside I check to make sure we received 9,000 yen each. 
％Ｂ
「Looks ikes there's 18,000 yen between the two of us.」
Only 62,000 until we reach 80,000
％Ｂ
「At the rate we're going, we'll be able to save up soon. Let's keep up the good work!」
Sora
「Umhm」
