「Oh man... Look at that wind...」
I see the trees in the yard swaying violently. The rain that started up earlier in the afternoon's only getting stronger.

％Ｂ
「Good thing we wrapped things up early today.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
all
We spent the morning sorting the cardboard everyone had collected by size. We didn't want to have even a single day go to waste, with the limited time we have.


But we can't fight nature.
According to the weather forecast, there's a hurricane that's about to bear down on Shionagi.
It's going to hit us directly, and it'll apparently be at its strongest sometime tonight.
％Ｂ
「Good thing we finished working yesterday. If things were off by a day, the events would've been canceled and we wouldn't have gotten paid for the day.」


Sora nods as she looks outside the window next to me.
％Ｂ
「You sure you didn't need to go straight home?」
Sora
「...Nothing to do at home. I can't see stars with this weather.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, can't really see that happening...」
Sora
「...But I won't be bored with you
, Ryou

.」
％Ｂ
「Hm?」
Sora
「...I'm always excited just being around you. I could never be bored like this.」

％Ｂ
「...You know you're making me wanna hug you tight when you say stuff that cute, right?」
all
Sora crumples over at my words.
Sora
「...Gasp...! I did it again...」
％Ｂ
「...You've picked up a weird habit.」
％Ｂ
「Still... The wind and rain are seriously crazy right now... You might not be able to go home at this rate.」

Sora
「...That's all in the plan.」
％Ｂ
「What? You say something?」
Sora
「...*shake shake*」
％Ｂ
「Anyway, wanna watch those movies we rented?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
all
We rented a few movies on the way home.
It's mostly science fiction stuff with "stars" as a key term.
Sora picked one out too, and...
％Ｂ
「Let's start with the one you picked. What'd you get?」
Sora
「...Mm.」
She proudly shows me the film she rented. "NATURAL GEOGRAPHIC Mysteries of Space: The History of the Solar System." Not a movie, but a documentary.




％Ｂ
「Mhm. Never change, Sora.」
Sora
「?」
all
We sit together on the living room couch and gaze upon the mysteries of space.\n\r

I've never really watched stuff like this before, but wow.
They're not using CG. They're talking about the solar system using photos of planets that were taken by a telescope that was apparently flown out to space.

And it's easy to understand too.
I notice Sora's looking at me.
She's smiling. Maybe she's happy that I'm so into learning about space.

I smile too.
Man... This is nice.
Getting to smile and enjoy some quiet time with the girl you like is just plain amazing.

all
The wind and rain pick up even more as the sun begins to set.
％Ｂ
「...This doesn't look good... I feel like you could get blown away by the wind if you stepped outside right now, Sora.」


Sora
「...I could see it.」
％Ｂ
「Uh, that was supposed to be a joke...」
all
I change the channel. There's an inset in the corner of the screen that constantly shows information about the hurricane.

There's a flash flood warning for Shionagi right now.
％Ｂ
「Jokes aside though, you probably won't be able to go home like this...」
It's affected transportation too. There's text on the screen warning us of temporary suspension of bus and train services.

And it's too dangerous to go walking outside anyway.
An umbrella wouldn't even help. It'd either turn inside out or get blown away immediately.

％Ｂ
「Hey, how are you gonna get home? We could probably still call a taxi...」

％Ｂ
「Wait, what? Sora?」
She's suddenly disappeared.
I spot her a little further away with her cell phone up to her ear.
...Is she calling someone?
Sora
「...I'm... still at a friend's house... Yeah... I know...」
Sora
「...It's dangerous going home like this... I'll stay the night here.」
Sora
「...Don't worry... No issues... Okay then...」
She hangs up and turns toward me.
％Ｂ
「Sora? ...You said you're staying the night at a friend's house... You mean...?」
She gives me a thumbs-up while I'm trying to piece things together.
Sora
「...Just as planned.」
When'd you put together a plan like that...?
％Ｂ
「I don't mind if you stay over... but what are you gonna do about clothes? I can lend you a T-shirt or something...」

But the same won't go for underwear and stuff, obviously.
Sora
「...No issues. I brought a change of clothes.」
She points at her bag.
Sora
「...Just as planned.」
She snaps her thumb up at me again.
all
I'm excited now that I know Sora's going to be staying the night.
Which... is probably why I'm making this request.
％Ｂ
「I wanna see you in a naked apron.」
Sora
「...???」
Sora looks confused.
Though I guess that's natural, considering that was my response to her telling me she was going to make dinner.

Sora
「Naked apron? As in, wearing an apron while naked?」
％Ｂ
「Yep. It's exactly what it sounds like.」
Sora
「Does that mean we're going to do dirty stuff now?」
％Ｂ
「No, I want you to make dinner.」
Sora
「I'm cooking, but I'm naked?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah.」
Sora
「I don't really understand, but I'll try it if that's what you want
, Ryou

.」
％Ｂ
「Please do!」
all
Naked in the kitchen...
She told me she didn't want me to look until she was ready because she was embarrassed about the complete contextual mismatch.

％Ｂ
「Y-You about ready, Sora?」
Sora
「...Not yet.」
I don't hear the sounds of her changing anymore.
％Ｂ
「You ready?」
Sora
「...Ready.」
％Ｂ
「Then... can I turn around?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
My heart's pounding just as hard as the rain and wind against the windows. I turn around.

％Ｂ
「...」
Whooooooooaaahhh!?
bそら_エッチシーン６_pe
After dinner, we took a bath together and now we're cuddling in a futon together.
Sora
「Mmm～～～」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「What's up?」
Sora
「I opened my eyes and
Ryou
 you
 appeared.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Huh, I guess you're right.」
Sora
「Mmm～～～」
Sora
「I'm so happy...」
She blushes as she whispers that.
Sora
「When I close my eyes, I know you're nearby.」
Sora
「Feeling
Ryou's
 your
 heat when I sleep makes me so happy.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Me too, Sora.」
I caress her head.
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Seeing you before I go to bed is pure bliss.」
Sora
「Umhm」
Sora
「And when I wake up,
Ryou
 you
 will be the first thing I see.」
Sora
「I feel so blessed...」
Upon hearing that, I immediately hug Sora, as caresses are not enough to satisfy me any longer.

％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Ah...」
Sora
「Hmm?」
There's a faint scent of shampoo lingering on her hair. 
It's the same one I use, but why does it smell so much better on her?
Still, smelling this scent on Sora makes me conscious of her. 
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「...」
Sora
「
Ryou
 Hmm
?」
Turn a blind eye
Continunig hugging her
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「It's nothing.」
I'm probably acting too modest.
However, while Sora might be fine with it, I won't be able to forgive myself.
It'll only damage me further if I let these thoughts rot my mind.
Turn a blind eye to this, you can do it man.
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「...」
She's so cute, now that I'm seeing her up close. 
My girlfriend is so fucking cute.
Yep, I'll have to calm myself down.
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「We should be sleeping soon.」
I turn to Sora and smile at her.
If I end up doing it again, that'll relfect poorly on me.
At the very least, I want to feel Sora when I sleep.
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「I want to keep hugging you when I fall asleep Sora.」
Sora
「That's... fine.」
She sounds a bit embarrassed, but she's pleased hearing that.
Our overlapping heartbeats seem to be communing as one in a rhythmical fashion.
Hearing that calms down my surging urges.
Sora
「I just want to say one more thing」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「What?」
Sora
「Good night
Ryou

.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, good night Sora.」
While this is my first time hugging someone when I'm
going to bed, I never felt so satified before.
Perhaps if I marry Sora, I'l be able to feel this every day.
Okay, that thought has a dangeorus level of bliss.
I can feel myself drifting to sleep feeling the heat from her skin and her slow and steady breaths.
In the face of the violent storms outside,
our hearts are calm and peaceful, bringing us immense joy.
