Marika
「G-Good morning...」
％Ｂ
「H-Hey...」
Our first morning together as lovers.
There's no way we've actually changed or anything... but it's still an incredibly special morning.

％Ｂ
「W-Wanna get going?」
Marika
「Y-Yeah.」
It's awkward, but I'm also kinda happy.
Marika
「We'll have to get back to working hard for the Tanabata Festival starting today.」
But I can't just sit here on cloud nine.
Now that exams are over, our preparations for the Tanabata Festival resume today.
％Ｂ
「Should get working on the planetarium soon, too.」
Marika
「Oh, you're right. I'm excited for how that's going to turn out, too.」

％Ｂ
「We'll get to see the stars together for sure this time.」
Because Shinozaki didn't get to come to the stargazing night back in grade school.
Marika
「Yeah, I'm looking forward to it... Oh, so... are we going to tell the others about...?」

％Ｂ
「Yeah... Good question.」
About the fact we're dating now.
％Ｂ
「It'd be weird to hide it. We should say it properly.」
Marika
「Right? But being formal about saying it's getting me nervous... How should we say it～?」


％Ｂ
「I was the one who confessed, so I'll explain things. Just leave it to me.」

Marika
「O-Okay! Th-Then... Please do～」
Or so I say, but it really is pretty nerve-racking.
I wonder how everyone's gonna react.
all
Misa
「This may be enough tropical fish for now. I would like to display some slightly rarer fish as well, so perhaps we could go survey the capture spots on the weekends?」


So what she's saying is we'll go for rarity over sheer numbers from now on.

It's not like that's completely necessary either, and we still have a decent amount of time, so we'll just take our time with this...

all
％Ｂ
「And so, I'm thinking we should start making some headway on the planetarium now.」

Sora
「...I've been waiting.」
％Ｂ
「Sorry for making you wait. But I'll be doing everything I can to support you starting now.」

Ousaka nods solemnly.
％Ｂ
「As for the planetarium...」
Sora
「...Here.」
She pulls out a sphere of some kind from the bag at her feet.

Touko
「...That's a planetarium?」
Sora
「...For home use.」
It seems to be one of those ones you can buy normally that project stars onto your ceiling.
％Ｂ
「It's not like we really know what planetariums are like, right? I've seen them before, but I've never really paid attention to how they work and stuff.」

％Ｂ
「So I had her bring this as a sample.」
all
Misa
「Which means... that will show us stars?」

Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「Let's try turning it on, then. It's better to see it than hear about it.」

all
Sora
「...Roger.」
Marika
「I'll close the curtains, then.」
all
The classroom goes dark.
Sora
「...Turning it on.」
Hazy pinpricks of light project onto the ceiling.

Misa
「Oh my... It's very pretty.」
I can tell this is pretty atmospheric for everyone.
There are way more stars than I expected too.
Rikka
「I feel like just this much might be enough.」
Sora
「...No. There isn't enough illumination to project all of it onto the ceiling.」
Touko
「Really? You sure it isn't because the room's bright?」
Sora
「...It's only projecting partially right now.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, you're right.」
all
The stars are only projecting onto the portion of the ceiling right above us.
It makes sense once you think about it.
It's not like flashlights can illuminate a wide area either.
A laser-like light is bright, but there's a trade-off between brightness and coverage.

Sora
「...This only has enough luminance to put fuzzy projections onto the ceiling of a small room.」

Sora
「...It isn't even close to enough to get clear images on a classroom ceiling.」
％Ｂ
「So what you're saying is we need a way stronger light source.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
all
Marika
「So our first issue is the light.」

Touko
「Are we going to make it ourselves, like the water tank?」
Sora
「...Making it is possible.」
all
％Ｂ
「I found lots of different ways to make one on the internet. I think we'll be able to make it work.」

％Ｂ
「And actually, you can't really buy light bulbs stronger than household ones. So I'll look into a doable-looking method on the internet.」

Sora
「...Me too.」
And so it seems like this might be about as much as we can discuss for the planetarium for today.

all
...Onto the main topic, then.
Though that just now was also the main topic.
％Ｂ
「So there's one more thing I wanna talk to you guys about...」
Marika
「Oh...」
Shinozaki realizes where this is going, and her expression becomes tense.
I'm obviously going to talk about us two.
Misa
「Are there any issues?」
all
％Ｂ
「No, it's not an issue...」
all
Shinozaki steps up next to me.
Marika
「...」
Natsuki
「What's going on? What's with this weird itchy mood!? Is there something between you two?」

％Ｂ
「Well, uh...」
all
Misa
「Oh... Are you two perhaps...」
Oh, has she figured it out?
Okihara-senpai sure is sharp.
Misa
「You're getting married!」
Touko
「What!?」
Rikka
「Whaaat!?」
all
Natsuki
「Marrieeeeeeeeeeeeed!?」
Marika
「Wha, no, not married...」
％Ｂ
「Whoa!?」
Natsuki
「This is an incredible moment! My name might echo forever in the halls of the grad-alb committee for this!!」

％Ｂ
「Why the hell would us getting married mean that your name's the one that gets echoed forever!?」

％Ｂ
「And that's not it! We're not getting married! We're just dating now!!」

Natsuki
「Wha...?」

Sora
「...Engaged?」
％Ｂ
「No.」
all
Touko
「Whaaat?」
％Ｂ
「What's that supposed to mean?」
all
I was so nervous about this too...
Misa
「Um, I'm very sorry... It appears my hasty conclusions created a disappointed mood...」

％Ｂ
「No, it isn't your fault...」
Misa
「But, this is a very wonderful thing. Congratulations to you two.」


Natsuki
「Well, I guess it's still a happy moment. Here, I'll take a photo to commemorate you guys starting your relationship then.」

％Ｂ
「To commemorate...」
all
That might be kinda nice.
I look at Shinozaki. She's smiling happily at me.
all
％Ｂ
「Could you do that, then?」
Natsuki
「There's the request! Okay then, stand over there!」
％Ｂ
「Here?」
Natsuki
「No, no! What are you putting your backs to the window for!? You'll add backlighting! You gotta stand kinda diagonal relative to the window.」


Marika
「Like this?」
Natsuki
「Yeah, yeah, that's it! Natural light's the best for this!」

Natsuki
「Mmm, get closer, you two! What are you standing so far apart for? You're not unrelated anymore!」


Rikka
「Not unrelated anymore...」
No, we're still not related...
But I'd feel like a jerk for saying something like that out loud, so I'll keep quiet.

all
Shinozaki's face is bright red.
Not unrelated... Huh.
There may or may not be a part of me... that's thinking that it'd be nice if we really ended up that way.

Touko
「How about you link arms?」
all
Yukimura's smirking a bit.
She's definitely trying to mess with us, isn't she?

Natsuki
「Oh, that's a good idea. Let's do that!」
But her suggestion is immediately approved.
all
Marika
「L-Like this?」
Shinozaki places her hands on my arm.
She's just kinda touching me.
Natsuki
「That's called "touching." You know what "linking" is? You go after him hard! Real hard!」

Marika
「A-Auh... L-Like this, maybe?」
This time, she actually wraps her arm around mine.
At the same time, she brings her soft body closer...
Squish...
Th-This sensation is... Shinozaki's breasts...
Natsuki
「Oooh～ I like it, I like it♪」
all
％Ｂ
「H-Hurry up and take the photo!」
Natsuki
「Don't rush me. I'm adjusting the exposure right now.」
I don't have the time for that.
If she doesn't hurry up, my face'll go slack from how Shinozaki's breasts feel.
I'll end up making an absolutely pathetic face!
％Ｂ
「H-Hurry up!」
Marika
「...???」
Natsuki
「Oh, shut up. Here goes, then. Gimme a smile♪」

Click!
Natsuki
「Okay!」
all
％Ｂ
「Phew...」
Marika
「Wah, are you okay? You're sweating so much... Was it hot from how close I was?」

％Ｂ
「N-No, that's not...」
I managed to get through that, but it was close...
Marika
「Just a second. I'll wipe away your sweat.」
She dabs at my forehead with a handkerchief.
％Ｂ
「R-Right... Thanks.」
Touko
「Whew, whew! Very passionate.」
Marika
「Th-That's not whyyy... He'll catch a cold otherwise...」
all
Sora
「...It's like a surgery.」
Misa
「You're very composed, Sora-san.」
And same goes for you, Okihara-senpai...
Misa
「Congratulations again, you two. May you experience everlasting happiness.」

％Ｂ
「Everlasting... Th-Thank you very much.」
all
Touko
「Invite me to the wedding, okay～?」

Natsuki
「I'll take your wedding photos too!」
Rikka
「You're really jumping the gun here...」
all
Marika
「...」
％Ｂ
「Y-Yeah, seriously.」
But I'm glad that everyone's supportive.
More than anything...
Marika
「Ehehe.」
Because Shinozaki looks so happy.
That's the most important thing. I'm so glad.
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Oh, okay. So if it's like this, the shaft won't be stable.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「So that means I need to change blueprint to this. At this rate, we'll probably have to get more materials.」

It's completely dark out now.
I'm going over the design for the planetarium and adding the final touches on the base outline. 

％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「I think we should be fine with the budget, but I should ask Ousaka just in case. I can probably do that after school tomorrow when we're out shopping.」

Everything should be perfect, with all the planning we're doing.
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「We should start working on making it soon. Damn, I'll have to copy the blueprint. I guess I'll use the photocopier at school.」

％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Huh...?」
All of a sudden, I hear a vibration from somewhere.
Is that my phone?
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Ah...」
One look at the call display and my heart starts throbbing.
_smh_st_02
_smh_st_btn02
_smh_st_02
_smh_st_btn05
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Hey.」
I immediately answer her call.
Marika
『Ah, hello! Good evening, it's me, Shinozaki!』
Marika
『Is it alright to be calling right you now～?』
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Umm, what's with the stitled voice?」
Marika
『Ahahaha... That's something my mom always says...』
Marika
『Whenever I'm calling someone, I don't know if they're busy or not.』

％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「I guess it's good to be considerate.」
Marika
『Yeah, that's why I copy her verbatim.』
Marika
『So Hino, what'cha doing?』
Marika
『So, what'cha doing?』
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Oh, I'm just working on prep for the plaentarium.」
Marika
『Oh, were you doing something important?』
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Nah, I was just taking a breather when you called.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「How about you, Shinozaki?」
Marika
『Oh, me? I just finished my homework, so you know...～』
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Do you have errands to do or something?」
Marika
『No, not at all, It's just that...』
Marika
『I just... wanted to talk to you.』
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Oh...」
That's somewhat of an embarrassing thing to say.
Even though I'm only on the phone with her, I recall the face Shinozaki makes when she blushes. All of a sudden, I get really warm.

％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Thanks. I wanted to talk to you too. Glad we're on the same page.」

Marika
『H-huh～ Really...?』
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Yeah, of course.」
Marika
『That's good～...』
Marika
『Ahaha... we're always togeher at school, but it feels a bit weird now.』
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Well, we're always together during school hours. Talking with you at night is a completely new experience though.」

Marika
『I mean, you know... it sort of feels like we're adults. It's like at night... I become a different person.』

％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Yeah, you become more sexy.」
Marika
『No way～...』
I can hear her giggling.
This tingling sensation is really comforting.
Marika
『Oh yeah, did you see the pics Segawa took?』
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「The ones she sent on LIME? Yeah, I saw those.」

Marika
『They were so pretty! I feel so moved looking at them.』
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Yeah, they're good pics. The lighting was good and it was well focused.」


Marika
『True! Having everyone congratulate us and capturing that in picture... That makes me so happy～』

％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「That'll definitely be a memento for us.」
Marika
『Yep, a memento!』
Marika
『I should print it and hang it in my room... But if my dad sees it, that would be awkward...』

Marika
『I guess I'll settle for looking at it on my phone once in a while.』
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Hahaha, I guess so.」
Marika
『But you know, there's something I regret about that pic.』
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「And what's that?」
Marika
『Well... I look so stiff and nervous. I should have had a better smile.』

％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「You think so? I think you look cute.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Besides, we can just take more in the future, you know.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「I mean... we're dating after all.」
Marika
『Ah... Y-yeah... Yeah, you're right... Yep～』

％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「You're exaggerating it.」
Marika
『No, not at all～...』
Her bubbly voice tickles my ear again. 
Combined with that fact that she's lowering her voice, it's like she's whispering directly into my ear.
Marika
『Ah... sorry, can you hold on for a moment?』
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Yeah, sure.」
Marika
『Yes! Just hold on, I'll be in there soon!』
I can hear her voice through the phone.
Marika
『Sorry, my mom told me that the bath was ready.』
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Oh yeah, I guess it's getting pretty late.」
Marika
『Yeah...』
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「See you tomorrow then.」
Marika
『Yeah, see you tomorrow. We'll see each other again.』

Seems like Shinozaki doesn't want to hang up.
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Oh yeah, want to go to school together tomorrow?」
Marika
『Oh, yeah! Let's do it! I think that's great!』
Marika
『I'l pick you up then!』
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Sure, I'll be waiting then.」
Marika
『Ahh～ I'm so excited～ I'll probably drop by a little earlier then.』
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「If you get here too early, I still might be asleep.」
Marika
『Then I'll just wake you up!』
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Sure thing. See you tomorrow!」
Marika
『Yeah, see you tomorrow!』
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Yeah, sweet dreams.」
Marika
『Good night!』
_smh_st_04
Hearing her sweet voice, I hang up.
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「So she's coming... to wake me up.」
This is a such classic trope for any couple!
I can't wait for tomorrow!
