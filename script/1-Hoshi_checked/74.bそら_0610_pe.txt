After school.
I'm heading to the event committee office with Segawa and Shinozaki for another meeting.


Narusawa's with us, of course.
Though that's only because Segawa pretty much kidnapped her again...
％Ｂ
「Oh, I'm gonna go to the bathroom, so you guys go ahead without me.」
Natsuki
「Sure thiiing. Let's go, Rikka.」
Rikka
「Sigh... Fine.」
all
％Ｂ
「Phew... All right, let's go. Hm? Isn't that...?」
_00cutinBS
I spot Ousaka waddling toward me with the telescope from the other end of the hallway.

_00cutinBS
％Ｂ
「Yo, Ousaka.」
Sora
「...」
She must not be able to see me too well because the telescope's getting in the way.
Sora
「...
Ryou?

」
％Ｂ
「Hey. Club activities starting now?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
She conks her head against the telescope as she nods like she always does.
％Ｂ
「...Y-You okay...?」
Sora
「...Hurts.」
％Ｂ
「You're going up to the roof, right? I'll carry that for you.」
I grab the telescope out of her hands and we head up to the roof together.
The two of us set the telescope up in the same spot as always.
The usual tanzaku flutters in the wind on the telescope.
％Ｂ
「This fine?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「All right. I'll be going, then.」
Sora
「...Not going to look?」
％Ｂ
「I've got an event committee meeting right now, for the Tanabata Festival. Wanna come with? It's pretty fun just listening.」

Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「All right. Feel free to let me know if you ever feel like it.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
all
％Ｂ
「Later then.」
Sora
「...Wait
, Ryou

.」
％Ｂ
「Hm?」
Sora
「...Thanks for carrying the telescope.」
％Ｂ
「Sure thing.」
all
I exit the rooftop.
Today's meeting is a more formal affair, with other event committee members in charge of various other things also present.

Okihara-senpai's here too, to show everyone her face now that the naturalist club's formally decided to participate.

Shuuichi announced at the beginning of the meeting that the naturalist club would be participating, as well as the fact that Narusawa would be helping us out as a temporary committee member.

Shuuichi
「Which means that the astronomy club is the only club who's deferred its decision on participating. We're currently in the middle of negotiating.」


Shuuichi
「We'd like for all of the clubs to participate. Having every single club participate would be an incredible achievement in the Tanabata Festival's history.」


Event Committee Member A
「Yeah, but thinking realistically, we don't have much time when you consider the time you'd need to prepare. We still need to designate who's using which classrooms and stuff too.」


Event Committee Member B
「We can't delay everyone for the sake of just the astronomy club.」
Shuuichi
「That's... Well, that's true.」
all
Event Committee Member A
「The astronomy club said it would defer, but worst-case scenario, we might have to rule that the club must withhold their participation for this year if it takes too long.」


％Ｂ
「W-Wait a second, please! We're going to say not to participate after we finally got the astronomy to take back its nonparticipation status!?」


Event Committee Member B
「We're just talking about what might happen. We'd love for every club to participate, but the event committee has to consider the Tanabata Festival as a whole.」


％Ｂ
「But saying not to participate's... Hey, Shuuichi.」

Shuuichi
「Hm... We're not denying the astronomy club its right to participate. But the others aren't wrong. We can't afford to inconvenience the other clubs for the sake of just one.」


％Ｂ
「But it's just a matter of location, right? The club's not gonna do anything like barge in after everyone else and demand to use the gym.」


all
Event Committee Member A
「But we don't know what the club would do yet, right? What if the club wants to use the gym for something?」

％Ｂ
「That's...」
Event Committee Member B
「We're not being mean-spirited, you know. We're talking about how we can make things the best they can possibly be with the limited time and manpower we have.」


Event Committee Member C
「Getting every club to participate sounds nice, but I dunno if we want to really get too caught up with that... and I dunno if I should bring it up here, but the astronomy club's only got one member, right?」


Event Committee Member A
「That's right. Which means the club probably wouldn't be able to make anything particularly impressive even if it did participate.」

％Ｂ
「Now hold on a second. You're right, the astronomy club's only got one member. But that one member still does stuff for her club every single day.」


％Ｂ
「She carries heavy equipment up to the roof every day even though she's small, and she's serious about her club. You're right, one person might not be able to do much, but I don't think that means she doesn't need to participate.」


Event Committee Member A
「Gh...」
Event Committee Member C
「...Mgh... I apologize. I shouldn't have said what I did...」
％Ｂ
「Oh... I'm sorry too... I know someone new like me shouldn't act this way...」
％Ｂ
「...It's just... when I first transferred into this school, I was surprised to hear about the event organization committee.」

％Ｂ
「Because I've never heard of a committee whose job was to do everything it could to support school life in this way.」

％Ｂ
「Personally... I think that the role of this committee is to support clubs that want to do things that they couldn't do with a small number of people... or just one person.」


Event Committee Member B
「That's...」
Shuuichi
「...」
Misa
「Excuse me... May I also make a statement on the matter?」
％Ｂ
「Senpai...?」
Shuuichi
「Please.」
Misa
「The naturalist club also only has one member, but that does not impede our activities. I am only doing what I personally enjoy doing, and so my everyday activities are very fun.」


Misa
「However, I have recently begun to wish to share this enjoyment with others.」

Misa
「It is because I have learned that, while doing things you like by yourself is well and good, doing things with other people is also very fun.」


Misa
「I would like for nothing more than for Ousaka Sora-san, the astronomy club president who is in the same situation as myself, to also know this feeling.」

Misa
「This year's Tanabata Festival will be my first and last time participating. However, Sora-san is still a first year.」

Misa
「If she comes to know this enjoyment this year, then she may also wish to participate again next year, and the year after that.」


％Ｂ
「In any case, please don't do anything to prevent the astronomy club's participation from our end! Please!」

Natsuki
「That's some pretty good stuff they're saying. Come on, Nirasawa. How's the event committee chair gonna wrap all this up?」

all
Shuuichi
「
Ryousuke
This guy
's got a point... However, we still have to continue our work as the event committee. We don't have the time to devote the entire committee to the astronomy club.」


％Ｂ
「But that doesn't mean─」
Shuuichi
「That's why I'm formally appointing you as the astronomy club's exclusive support staff. You're gonna convince the astronomy club to participate.」

％Ｂ
「...Wha?」
Shuuichi
「And if the astronomy club decides to participate, then you're going to with its preparations. You won't be able to rely on the other committee members since they're going to be supporting the participating clubs starting today.」


Shuuichi
「We need to work on everything simultaneously if we don't want it all to fall apart at once. It might be a heavy responsibility for a new member like you, but...」

％Ｂ
「No, I'll do it! I'll handle it!」
Shuuichi
「Okay. But the event committee will have more things to do the closer we get to the Tanabata Festival. Narusawa may be helping us this time, but to be honest, we're still short on people.」


Shuuichi
「If it's looking like the astronomy club won't decide to participate in time, I'm going to have you give up on its participation right then and there and support other clubs.」


Shuuichi
「And of course, I'm going to have you do general event committee work while you're negotiating with the astronomy club too. And I want a weekly progress report every Monday. Understand?」


％Ｂ
「Got it. Fine by me.」
Shuuichi
「Everyone else good with that too?」
all
Event Committee Member A
「Yeah. No complaints from me.」
Event Committee Member B
「We'd like for every club to participate if it's possible, after all.」
Event Committee Member C
「We'll leave the astronomy club to the new guy.」
Marika
「That's great.」
Misa
「Please do your best.」
％Ｂ
「Thank you very much, Senpai... You too, Shinozaki... and...」

all
Rikka
「...I just have to do event committee work for you while you're convincing Ousaka-san, right?」

％Ｂ
「My bad... Sorry for the trouble, Narusawa.」
Rikka
「It's fine... I was already expecting this.」
Natsuki
「Oh, that's Rikka for you! She's so sharp!」
Rikka
「You'll be helping me too of course, Segawa-san. You need to take responsibility for forcing me to do all this.」

Natsuki
「Oh, you're still sore about that...」
all
I immediately go back up to the roof after the meeting.
I'm going to tell Ousaka, who's watching the moon like always, how the meeting went.

％Ｂ
「So I've been formally appointed to support the astronomy club.」
Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「Let's get along.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「So well, let me just ask right away. You think of anything you wanna try doing for the Tanabata Festival?」

Sora
「...*shake shake*」
％Ｂ
「Figured. Not the kinda thing you could come up with in just a day.」
But that's exactly why I'm supposed to support her.
％Ｂ
「All right, got it. So I'll be tagging along with the astronomy club's activities for a while starting today. Looking forward to it.」


Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「Hm? You look like you wanna ask why I'll be tagging along. Wanna know why? I bet you do. Yeah, I can see why you'd wanna know.」


Sora
「...I didn't say anything.」
％Ｂ
「You can't really get into the idea of participating in the Tanabata Festival 'cause you can't think of anything you wanna do, right?」

Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「So I'm gonna do astronomy club stuff with you, and the two of us can find something together... Or that's my reasoning, more or less.」

Sora
「...Is the event committee supposed to do that much?」
％Ｂ
「Hmm... No idea. Probably not normally?」
Sora
「...So why are you doing that much
, Ryou

?」
％Ｂ
「Why... Uh... 'Cause I'm in the event committee?」
Sora
「...I don't get it.」
％Ｂ
「...Yeah. Me neither... Well, either way, I'll be seeing you around.」

％Ｂ
「Oh, but you don't have to worry about me or anything. Just do your usual thing like always.」

Sora
「...*nod*」
all
She nods and looks back into the eyepiece.
I walk over to the wall so I'm not in Ousaka's way, and sit on the ground.

％Ｂ
「Phew...」
Something to do... Something to do...
I don't know anything more than the average person when it comes to stars. Can someone like me come up with an idea that'd pique Ousaka's interest?


％Ｂ
「...Guess there's no point in thinking about it too hard.」
I can't afford to relax too much, but it's not like rushing's going to help me come up with a good idea.

I'll just participate in Ousaka's stuff, and I can try to find something that might be relevant for the festival...

Ousaka's been doing stuff by herself this whole time, but now I'll be there too.
That should already be a pretty big change for her.
％Ｂ
「...」
I watch Ousaka vaguely as I think.

％Ｂ
「...Zzz... Zzz...」
％Ｂ
「Nnh... Nnnh... Cold...」
I wake up from the cold.
I must've fallen asleep.
％Ｂ
「...Huh?」
I don't see Ousaka by the telescope.
％Ｂ
「Maybe she went to go buy a drink or something...?」
There's no way she'd go home without putting the telescope away...
％Ｂ
「Wait, whoa!?」
I look to the side to see Ousaka sitting there next to me.
Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「S-So that's where you were...」
And she's really close.
My heart's beating a little faster from her sudden approach...
％Ｂ
「...What happened to stargazing?」
She looks up at the reddening sky.
I look up too.
Sora
「...Clouds.」
％Ｂ
「Oh... I see.」
The sky's cloudy.
There's a big one right over the moon.
Looks like this is why stargazing's on hold.
％Ｂ
「That's a pretty big cloud. It's moving pretty slowly too. Probably won't clear up for a while.」

Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「Guess we'll just sit back and wait.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
all
We wait for the sky to clear up, keeping up this slightly too-close distance between us.
％Ｂ
「Shame it never cleared up.」
Sora
「...」
I'm walking back to the astronomy clubroom with Ousaka, carrying the telescope case.\n\r

The clouds never ended up going away before we had to leave school.
％Ｂ
「Would've been nice to keep going.」
Sora
「...Happens a lot. You can't win against nature.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, that's true.」
％Ｂ
「Whoops... Sorry. Guess I must be hungry.」
Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「Hey, wanna grab something to eat on the way home? 'Cause you know, I live alone right now. I don't wanna have to make something to eat at this point.」


％Ｂ
「But I don't really wanna eat somewhere by myself either, so come along with me.」

Sora
「...Eat what?」
％Ｂ
「I'm fine with anything. We can go somewhere you go to a lot. It'd just be rice bowls and ramen shops if I picked.」


Sora
「...I don't really know.」
％Ｂ
「You don't know? You don't usually go places to eat on the way home from club or anything?」

Sora
「...No.」
％Ｂ
「Really...」
I wonder if it's because she doesn't care about stuff like that, or she's just really serious.
％Ｂ
「...Anything you wanna eat, by any chance?」
Sora
「...I'll leave it up to you
, Ryou

.」
％Ｂ
「ふむ…じゃあ、ハンバーガーなんてどうだ？」
逢坂を連れてハンバーガーショップ「マクロナルド」に
やってきた。
初めて来たらしく、店の中をキョロキョロと不思議そうに
見回していた。
メニューの中から、逢坂でも大丈夫そうなのをチョイスして、
席へと移動する。
そら
「…これがハンバーガー…」
％Ｂ
「…ひょっとして、ハンバーガー食べたことないのか？」
そら
「…コクリ」
マジかー…。
今時珍しい子がいたもんだな。
そら
「…名前を聞いたことはある。
パンの中にハンバーグが挟んであるファーストフードの類。
焼きそばパンの親戚のような物」
％Ｂ
「うん…間違ってはいないけど、それだけでもないんだが」
そら
「…どうやって食べるの？」
％Ｂ
「そのままがぶっといくんだ」
そら
「…ワイルド…」
％Ｂ
「とりあえず、俺の真似をして食ってみろ」
俺は逢坂の前で包み紙を開いて、ハンバーガーに
かぶりついた。
％Ｂ
「はむっ…んぐんぐ…」
そら
「…おー…」
％Ｂ
「ゴクンッ…こんな感じだ。やってみ」
そら
「…コクリ」
逢坂は、恐る恐るといった様子でハンバーガーにかぶりつく。
そら
「はむ…むぐむぐ…」
％Ｂ
「どうだ？」
そら
「…んぐんぐ…ゴクン…」
そら
「…おいしい…！」
目をキラキラさせながら、力強く親指をグッと立てる逢坂。
％Ｂ
「そうか。気に入ってもらえたのならなによりだ。
どんどん食っていいぞ。あとポテトも食え」
そら
「はむ…むぐむぐ…あむ…んぐんぐ…」
最初は感情が読めない子だと思っていたけど、そうでもない。
目を輝かせながら、黙々とハンバーガーの攻略に夢中に
なっている。
梅干しの時もそうだったけど、好き嫌いにおいては
存外わかりやすいんだな。
そら
「んぐんぐ…ん…！」
％Ｂ
「ん？　どした？」
ハンバーガーにかぶりついたまま、表情を凍らせていた。
そら
「………」
そして、視線だけを俺に向けてくる。
何かを訴えたいようだけど…。
％Ｂ
「な、なにか変な物でも入ってたか？」
そら
「…すっぱい」
すっぱい？
そら
「…コリコリしてて、すっぱい」
％Ｂ
「ああ、ピクルスか。美味いだろ？」
そら
「…ふるふる」
％Ｂ
「え、ピクルスダメなのか？　梅干しは平気なのに？」
そら
「…コクリ」
％Ｂ
「意外だな…。
まぁ、ダメならダメで無理に食べなくてもいいぞ。
ピクルスだけよけておけ」
そら
「…もう、食べた…」
％Ｂ
「吐き出せば良かったのに」
そら
「…それは行儀が悪い」
％Ｂ
「そりゃ確かに…」
そら
「…次は気をつける…」
せっかくのハンバーガーデビューが、少しほろ苦いものに…
いや、ほろすっぱいものになってしまったか。
