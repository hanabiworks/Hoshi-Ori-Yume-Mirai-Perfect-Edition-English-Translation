I woke up early this morning to thoroughly clean the entire house.
Sora's coming over to discuss the planetarium today.

％Ｂ
「All right... This should be fine.」
This'll be the second time Sora's come over.
The last time was when Segawa and Shinozaki suddenly brought her with when they came to see how I was doing after I got sick.

Which means today'll be the first time Sora comes over by herself.

That's right─my "girlfriend" comes over for the first time today.
％Ｂ
「Phew... I'm pretty nervous...」
She said she'd come at around lunchtime, so I guess she should be here soon...
％Ｂ
「She...She's here...!」
I open the door. Sora's standing there in her casual clothes.
Sora
「...Hello.」
％Ｂ
「W-Welcome. Come on in.」
Sora
「...Please excuse me.」
Sora seems nervous too.
She's sounding a lot more formal than usual.
％Ｂ
「Uh, you fine coming up to my room?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
I lead Sora up to my room.
Which I've also tidied up, of course.
％Ｂ
「I'll go get us something to drink. You can sit anywhere.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「I'll be right back.」
all
I go downstairs to get some bottled water, tea, and snacks. I come back up to find Sora sitting stiffly in front of the table, looking nervous.


％Ｂ
「Is tea fine?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
Sora
「...No need to worry about me.」
％Ｂ
「R-Right... You know, you don't have to be so nervous.」
Sora
「...I don't... think I'm nervous... Am I?」
％Ｂ
「You're as stiff as a board.」
Sora
「...Really... I thought I'd be fine because I've been here before already...」
She seems confused at the fact that she's nervous.
％Ｂ
「It's fine. Just relax as much as you're able.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「All right. Let's start.」
all
We sit across from each other at the glass coffee table to start discussing the planetarium dome.

Sora
「...Look at this first.」
She pulls something out from her bag.
It looks like it's made out of cardstock.
％Ｂ
「...What's that?」
Sora
「...This is the dome opened up. I tried making this last night after I got home.」

％Ｂ
「Wha... You mean you made this?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
It's comprised of twelve cardstock isosceles triangles.
Actually, they look like triangles at first glance, but the equal-length sides are slightly curved.

Sora splits the triangles into three groups to form two trapezoids and a triangle.

Sora
「...And they come together like this.」
She wraps the bases of the three parts into each other to form rings.
She ends up with a big, thick ring, a smaller, narrower ring, and a wider one with a closed bottom, like a plate.

She places the smaller ring on top of the thicker one, and places the plate-shaped one on top like a lid.

They form a small hemispherical dome about twenty centimeters in diameter.
all
％Ｂ
「Ohh! That's awesome!」
Sora
「...This is the planetarium dome we'll try to make.」
％Ｂ
「Wow, you managed to make something like this?」
Sora
「...It's designed so anyone can make it if they do the calculations right.」
％Ｂ
「Anyone? ...I like to think I'm pretty good at making architectural models, but I've never done anything that's put together like this... Huh... I wouldn't have ever considered a design like this.」


I would've gone straight for support pillars and braces.
Sora
「...If we make the actual dome in the same way, we'll be able to make it using just cardboard.」

％Ｂ
「This is about twenty centimeters in diameter, so a six-meter-diameter one would be thirty times bigger... I already knew we were going to need a lot of cardboard, but still...」


I take another good look at Sora's model dome.
％Ｂ
「This is kind of like an igloo.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「Hmm...」
Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「...」
...Uh?
The conversation's kinda stopped...
％Ｂ
「Uhh... I thought these were isosceles triangles at first, but it looks like they're actually a little curved.」

Sora
「...*nod*」
Sora
「...The edges that don't form the base have a slight curve. It's like looking at a bamboo shoot from the side.」

％Ｂ
「Oh... A bamboo shoot. I get it.」
Sora
「...Split a bamboo shoot into three equal parts and split it into two trapezoids from the bottom and a triangle at the top. You get this when you connect them.」

％Ｂ
「Hm... That makes things easier to understand.」
Sora
「...Making the sides of the triangles curved lets you make it more spherical when it's put together.」

Sora
「...The curves need to be calculated properly. If you take the height of the base as h, the radius of the dome as r, and the ratio of the circumferences of the pieces as n―」

all
Sora takes out a notebook and starts writing out formulas in it.
It's all trigonometric functions and equations for quadratic curvature.
I'm amazed at how fast she's working her way through the math.
Sora
「...Is how you get the degree of curvature.」
％Ｂ
「...I see.」
All I can do is nod.
Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「...」
And the conversation stops again.
I guess it's my fault for not having a better response...
Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「...」
Sora's staring at me.
I wonder what's going on. It feels like she's expecting something of me...

Sora's seemed nervous ever since she first came over today.

I've been nervous too.
Because the girl in front of me is my "girlfriend."
％Ｂ
「...Sora. Can I come over there?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
She lets a moment pass, as if to think, and then gives a small nod.
I nervously move over so I'm next to her.
I feel like her shoulders tense up a bit as I approach.
I try placing my hand over hers on the floor. She clenches her fist for a moment in surprise, but then I feel her gradually relax.


％Ｂ
「...Sora...」
She turns her face toward me, still bashfully looking away from me.

％Ｂ
「...Sora?」
I call her name again and this time she looks at me.
She's probably still embarrassed as her eyes are damp. 
Sora gets on my lap, her eyes are closed as if to steel herself.

％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Huh...? Um, Sora?」
It's my turn to be taken aback. 
However, Sora's eyes are shut tight as she turns her face to me.
It's as if she's waiting for something. 
Sora
「Augh...」
I'm glad she's tying her best to be bold. 
I wrap my arms around her and pull her in. 
Sora lifts her chin, mirroring the desires I'm displaying.

$$smh_OpenCHK
I walk with Sora to the bus stop.
％Ｂ
「So... do you want to go on a date tomorrow?」
Sora
「Date?」
％Ｂ
「With summer break coming up, we'll be too busy preparing for the Tanabata festival. 
I thought might as well take the chance now.」
Sora
「Umhm」
Sora
「Is there anywhere you want to go?」
％Ｂ
「Now that you say that, I want to see the stars with 
you. We went to the park last time, so how about the 
beach? Let's get a beachside view of the stars at night.」
Sora
「Only at night?」
％Ｂ
「Of course not, we can hang out during the day too.」
Sora
「Then I'll need a swim suit.」
％Ｂ
「Right. 
We'll be in the ocean during the day and then we'll be together during the night.」
Sora
「Umhm」
Sora
「I'm looking forward to tomorrow.」
With that, Sora gives me a cheerful smile.
all
And so...
Employee
「welcome!」
After I walked Sora to the bus stop, I head to conveinence store. 
I put cotton swabs and bandages in my basket as I 
look at the shelves with daily necessities.
％Ｂ
「...」
While pretending to look at the bandages, 
I take a quick peek at the nearby condoms every five seconds. 
I should really consider buying some...
It's proper etiquette after all...
But why are there so many types of condoms?
What's the difference between all of them?
And what's with all the flashy packaging?
It makes it a bit embarrassing to bring to the cashier.

％Ｂ
「...」
0.02
mm and
0.03
mm, won't they break if they're that thin?
Are these really fine?
These seem to have characters on them... 
Are they imprinted onto the rubber? Would Sora like it if I had star patterned condoms?
Huh, strawberry flavour? Condoms have flavours!?
They come in different sizes, but what is my size anyways?
How do I compare to others?
％Ｂ
「Should I call Shuuichi?」
"Hey, is your dick a small, medium or large?"
What kind of fucking question is that!? I can't ask that!
$$smh_OpenCHK
Y-you know, I think I should be fine with a standard size. 
Yeah, I think that should be okay. 
Yeah, if I'm normal, then a medium should do.
And if it ends up being too big... I think I might cry.
％Ｂ
（A-alright time to buy!）
I take a 0.03 millimetre medium size condom and
quickly toss it into my basket.
I bolt and head to the candy corner and stick a large box in my basket.
I mean a box of candies look likes a box of condoms.
The best place to hide a leaf is in the forest!

％Ｂ
「That should be fine.」
With the condoms now hidden, 
I head to the cashier.
And so...
％Ｂ
「Auh!」
Employee
「Huh, what's wrong?」
％Ｂ
「O-oh, nothing...」
The monitor at the cashier displays everything 
that's been scanned.
Which means...
Chocolate, Snacks, Snacks, Condom, Snacks...
Shit, there's no way out!
And the cherry on top is the condoms are now in
a separate bag. 
That small act of kindness is painful in a different way.
％Ｂ
「Hah...」
I don't think I can come back here for a while.
