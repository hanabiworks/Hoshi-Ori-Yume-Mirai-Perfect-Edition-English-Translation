「I got suggestions from the staff at Mr. Azuma's architectural firm, and brushed up the blueprints.」

I'm showing the new design suggestions to the others.
I spent all night drawing it up, taking all of the suggestions into account.
Natsuki
「That looks good. Looks like it's more polished now?」
％Ｂ
「They did a good job smoothing over the rougher parts of our ideas.」

Misa
「I may not be familiar with the industry specifics, but it does look very professional.」
％Ｂ
「It really does. I learned that every detail is important.」


all
Marika
「Yeah, I think it looks a lot better now～」

Touko
「But doesn't this mean we need a lot more stuff now?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, it does. We'll need to manage it with our limited budget.」

all
％Ｂ
「And so I was thinking of going out shopping for supplies in the afternoon...」
Marika
「Oh, then I'll come with.」
Marika immediately raises her hand.
That's my girlfriend for you.
My girlfriend...
Can't really stop myself from smiling when I think about it.
all
％Ｂ
「Uhh, so it'll be just us two. Is that all right with you guys?」
Touko
「That doesn't matter. We wouldn't want to get in the way of your date.」

％Ｂ
「No... We're just going shopping.」

Marika
「Y-Yeah～ It's for the Tanabata Festival.」
Natsuki
「But if it's you two together, then it's a date no matter what. We'd be like summer bugs flying into a fire if we tried to tag along.」


％Ｂ
「I have no idea what that means.」
Marika
「Auh...」
Looks like there's no choice but for us two to go alone.
Not that I have a problem with that.
...In fact, this is perfect.
all
Marika
「Hah～ There's some shade here. It feels so refreshing.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「It's so sunny. I'm worried I'll get sunburned.」
Marika
「For sure. I didn't put on sunscreen once, and I got burned really bad.」

％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Marika, have you been making sure to put on sunscreen since then?」
Marika
「Don't worry～ I have it all over my back.」
all
As we continue our conversation, we head to the shopping district.
Without any materials, we can't do anything 
so I told everyone that they had today off.
Anyways, seems like Okihara will be taking care of the fish for a litle while longer.
I think some of the others are still there too.
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「I didn't think that everyone would like fish that much.」
Marika
「I mean, they're so cute.」
Marika
「Hey, did you know the Moorish Idol I caught is apparently a rare fish?」


Marika
「Okihara said she rarely ever sees them in Shionagi.」

％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Well, if she said that, it must be true. That being said, it is a nice looking fish with its yellow body and horn and all.」

Marika
「Whenever I feed it, its horn sways to and fro. It's just so relaxing ～」

Marika
「Come on, let's hurry. I want to see everyone～...」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「We'll have to make sure we build the best planetarium.」
Marika
「Yep!」
all
I already have some sweat sticking to me as we make our way to the hardware depot.

％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「huh? That's...」
I take a look at a poster hanging in the shopping district.
Marika
「What's up?」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Oh, I was just looking at this.」
It's a poster for the town's local planetarium.
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「They have a special program for summer break called the "Night on the Galactic Railroad".」
Marika
「Huh～ That seems like a special program.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「When did Shionagi build this planetarium anyways?」

Marika
「It opened the year we entered elementary school. They were renovating the science museum, so they added a planetarium too.」


％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「You remember that far back?」
Marika
「We must have gone there for a school trip or something.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Huh, really?」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「I don't remember that... But now that you say it, I sort of feel like we went...」

Marika
「Ahaha, it's been so long, of course your memory is a bit fuzzy.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「We would have been in grade one... do you remember, Marika?」
Marika
「Ah, yeah... but I actually didn't go...」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Huh? Really?」
Marika
「Umm... I mean, I was really frail so I took the day of the field trip off.」

Marika
「That's why I remember it so well. I really wanted to go.」

As if she's remembering the past, she gazes at the poster.
I think back to Marika as a young girl, before I met her.
It must have been a lonely time for her because of her illness.
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「You want to go?」
Marika
「Huh, you mean right now?」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Yeah, right now. I mean, you want to see it, yeah? I don't really remember either.」

％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Might as well jump on the oppurtunity.」
Marika
「I mean... you have a point.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Besides, this will be a good experience for helping us make a good planetarium.」

Marika
「Y-yeah, that makes sense～...」
Marika
「Wah～ I feel so nervous...」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「That was sudden.」
Marika
「I mean... we're going to the planetairum alone... It feels a bit special.」

％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「I mean, there's a special program airing too.」
Marika
「You're right～ But I feel so flustered...」
Marika
「Take a deep breath, calm down...」
Marika
「Fuh... Hah...」
With a hand on her chest, she takes some deep breaths.
They don't feel like heavy breaths though.
Marika
「Okay, I calmed down...」
I can't believe such small breaths were that effective.
Marika
「I want to see the planetarium too...」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Alright, let's go.」
Marika
「Yeah... Ehehe...」
Marika
「We're going to the planetairum together, it's like a dream～...」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「You're exaggerating.」
Marika
「Well, of course～ I'm looking forward to this.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「The next screening is in 20 minutes, let's get going.」
Marika
「Let's get a move on!」
I take a hold of her dainty hand.
With a spring in her step, she follows after me.

Narration
『Far away in the distance, the sounds of children singing could be heard. It was the night of the Tanabata, on the hill of weather wheel. Under the skies of the Milky Way, the roaring engine of a train steadily approaches.』





Narration
『On the Milky Way station. A mysteirous voice calls out, as a dazzling light as fills the void taking them on board a train at the dead of night.』


Narration
『And on that summer day, the journey of two boys shall begin...』

％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Damn, that was good!」
This special program for summer break was worth the price of admission.
They didn't just have projections of stars, 
but they combined story-telling with audio to create a magnificent world.
It's amazing that this show only cost 500 yen to see.

Marika
「Hgh... Guh... Egh... Eguhguh...」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Huh, Marika!?」
She's wailing!?
Marika
「Fuh... I'm crying this much...」
Marika
「It was already so sad by the time they arrived at Southern Cross.」
Marika
「And they said they would be together～!」
Seems like Marika was completely swept up in all the emotions.
all
But I understand how she feels.
The narration was soothing and the music was melodic and peaceful. 
Combining that with the projection of the stars was already enough to do me in.
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「It really was amazing.」
Marika
「Yeah... Eguhguh... I was～...」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「It'd be nice if we made something like this too.」
Marika
「True...」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Hey, you're crying too much. Here...」
Marika
「Thanks...」
I wipe her tears away with my hand.
Her tears are warm.
Marika
「Mmm...」
Her moist eyes look into mine.
Marika
「Ehehe...」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「What is it?」
Marika
「Could you... wipe the other side too?」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Sure. Is this good?」
Marika
「Yep... thanks...」
She gives me sweet, happy smile.
Once again, tears start pouring out of her eyes.
Marika
「Augh～ They're coming out again...」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Not much you can do about that. Do you have a hankercief?」
Marika
「Y-yeah, here.」
She timidly grabs a hankerchief from her bag.
It's a plain and simple terrycloth.
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Here, close your eyes.」
Marika
「W-wah!」
It reaches her eyes as I give that area a good wiping.
Marika
「Augh...」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「How are you now?」
Marika
「I-I'm all good.」
The hankerchief is wet from her tears.
Marika
「Ehehe...」
With that, she looks up with her reddened eyes. 
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「What is it now?」
Marika
「I just had so much fun.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「You were crying because of that?」
Marika
「It's all part of the experience.」
Marika
「I'm glad my first time at a planetarium was with you.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Hmm...」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「I'm glad I had fun with you too.」
Marika
「That makes me so glad～」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Okay, let's get shopping!」
Marika
「Alright!」
all
I want to make a planetarium that is able to invoke that much emotion.
With that, I temper my newfound resolve.
Marika
「We're going to make it that big～?」
She widens her eyes at the size of the acrylic hemispheres in my hand.
They're big enough that Marika might have to hold them in both hands.
％Ｂ
「We'll be able to project lots of stars this way. Though it'll be more work to make all the holes.」

Marika
「We're going to have to cover the surface with small holes, right? Yeah, that's going to be a lot of work. But I'm sure it'll be doable if we all split the workload together!」


Marika
「And that light bulb's so big too.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, it is.」
I ordered it from the electrician's and had them acquire it for me.
It's big enough that it looks like it'll be a few times brighter than a normal incandescent bulb.
％Ｂ
「They apparently use these for studio spotlights. I bet this'll let us project even the small stars all the way across the room.」

Marika
「We'll have to do our best making the holes for the stars, then!」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. Let's work hard and make it amazing. Let's see, was this all we needed...?」

Marika
「Oh... Can we stop by that 100-yen store really quick? I'll be done in a minute, so it'd make me happy if you waited here. Since you have lots of bags.」


％Ｂ
「Got it.」
Marika
「I'll be right back then～」
all
Marika goes running off.
％Ｂ
「...Hm?」
I look around to see that I'm standing in front of a drugstore.
I feel like there was something I needed to buy here...
all
％Ｂ
「Oh.」
I remember now. From back when we were kissing in my room.
％Ｂ
「I should probably buy some... right?」
I don't know when it'll happen, of course.
I need to make sure I have them ready when it does, as a man.
...Marika isn't back yet.
％Ｂ
「...All right. Now's the time.」
％Ｂ
「I-I bought them...」
I was crazy nervous, but I managed to buy them.
I didn't have the presence of mind to calmly pick one out. The packaging says "Nice and thin" on it.

％Ｂ
「Kinda weirdly graphic... Maybe she's gonna think I'm creepy, 'cause it looks like I'm dying to do it...」

But I can't just go and return it now...
Marika
「Sorryyy, thanks for waiting!」
％Ｂ
「Aaagh!?」
Marika
「Kyah!? ...Wh-What's wrong? Why were you so surprised?」
％Ｂ
「N-No reason, okay!? No reason at all!」
Marika
「R-Really? But... why is your face so red...?」
％Ｂ
「N-No, it's really no reason, okay!? I had no impure feelings or anything...!」

Marika
「Impure feelings?」
％Ｂ
「I-I mean...」
Crap. The more I talk, the more suspicious I seem.
％Ｂ
「Anyway, you done with your shopping?」
Marika
「Yeah, I am.」
％Ｂ
「Then let's go.」
Marika
「Okay, let's go.」
...Maybe I should've gone for something more innocuous after all?
