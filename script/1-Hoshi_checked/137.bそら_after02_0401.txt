「It's been a while since we came back here.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
Sora and I are visiting Shionagi First Academy together in April.
Though we don't have any kind of business here, and we're not planning on going inside either.

Sora's off today, so we were taking a walk together to see the flowers, and we just decided to go look at the academy's cherry blossoms.

％Ｂ
「They still haven't built anything where the old building was.」
They torn down the old building when I was in my third year.
Even now, it's still a vacant lot.
I have so many memories with the old building.
For the Tanabata festival, Okihara used one of the 
old building classrooms for the natural science club's aquarium.
And as for Sora's event for the astronomy club, 
we used the old building as the place to build our planetarium.
％Ｂ
「And the old school building had an owner too... I wonder how Yukimura, Senpai, and the others are all doing.」

％Ｂ
「Coming here makes me wanna see them again.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
Sora
「...Want to make a wish on a tanzaku again?」
％Ｂ
「...A star-shaped one? I feel like it'd work.」
Especially since a star-shaped tanzaku helped me meet Sora again, which led to us being together even now.

Azuma
「Well if it isn't Hino.」
Azuma
「Yo.」

％Ｂ
「Wha...?」
Sora
「...Mo-san.」
Azuma
「Oh, you're here too, Sora-chan? What are you two doing here?」

％Ｂ
「We're just out on a walk. We decided to look at the cherry blossoms here from outside.」

Azuma
「Out seeing the flowers while I'm working, are you? If only I could live so carefree.」
％Ｂ
「Working? ...Did you get commissioned for something by the school, Teacher?」
Azuma
「Not the school, but the city. Right, you two are alumni from here, aren't you. You remember how there used to be an old school building here?」


Sora
「...*nod*」
Azuma
「It's been a while since it's been torn down, but the city's apparently decided to build a cultural hall on the site where that old school building stood.」

％Ｂ
「A cultural hall for the city? Inside the school?」
Azuma
「Yeah. It's apparently going to be something that anyone can use. So I've been asked to design that hall.」

％Ｂ
「Re...Really!?」
Azuma-san's going to be designing a new building to stand in place of the old school building that held so many memories for us. It makes me feel a little emotional, and happy.

％Ｂ
「Congratulations, Teacher!」
Sora
「...You're amazing, Mo-san.」
Azuma
「I'm happy about getting the job, of course, but it's kinda hard to be too happy about it.」

％Ｂ
「Is there a problem of some kind?」
Azuma
「I've got a lot on my plate for work right now, and I can't really get it all done. I know it's too late at this point, but we're really feeling your absence right about now.」


％Ｂ
「Wha...?」
Azuma
「Fact of the matter is, we don't have anyone who's gotten good enough to fill the hole you left behind. Though part of the reason why is 'cause I'm garbage at teaching.」


Azuma
「The more I think about it, the more I realize how good you were at what you did.」
％Ｂ
「Um... I'm sorry about that...」
Azuma
「...What kind of work do you have lined up right now?」
％Ｂ
「Me? Let's see, a friend of mine wants to have a new house built, and I also have a few minor remodeling jobs.」

Azuma
「Think you'll be able to get those done?」
％Ｂ
「The house-building's still going to take time, but the others are mostly done already. All that's left is to start talking to the contractors.」


Azuma
「Hoh, you're pretty efficient.」
％Ｂ
「It's only because you trained me so well, Teacher.」
Azuma
「All right. Help me out with this job, then.」
％Ｂ
「...」
％Ｂ
「...I'm sorry?
This job... You mean the cultural hall...?」
Azuma
「You'll have some time on your hands once the remodeling jobs are over, right? Grab a piece of this job, then.」

％Ｂ
「Wait, wha... Please wait a moment! It's a commission from the city, isn't it? Wouldn't it be bad for a third party to join in without permission?」


Azuma
「Don't worry. I'll back you. We can say it's a collaborative effort between my firm and yours.」

％Ｂ
「A collaborative...」
I'm fine agreeing to help a little with some design drafts, but I think this is definitely way too large-scale...

Azuma
「We'll handle all of the little stuff like the real estate and contractors. I want you to do the blueprint and design plan.」


I'm doing the design!?
Me, and not Azuma-san...!?
％Ｂ
「Th-That's definitely not okay, right!? The city wants your design, not mine―」

Azuma
「It's fiiine. You used to work at my firm. The client will be fine with it once they know that. Or more like I'll force them to be fine with it. I'll handle it.」


Azuma
「The city wants it to be complete by summer two years from now. It's a mid-sized hall, so I'm thinking one year for design, and another for the construction.」

％Ｂ
「In two years...」
It isn't an unreasonable time frame, but we won't have that much room for errors considering the scale.

If the design takes too long, then that just means the construction will be delayed by that much.
It's a lot of responsibility.
Azuma
「So... what are you gonna do? It's up to you if you wanna take it on.」
％Ｂ
「...」
all
I shiver from the sudden, important subject matter.
It's not because I'm afraid.
This shiver is... a shiver of excitement.
Sora
「...Ryou...?」
Sora
「...Are you okay?」
％Ｂ
「...Sora. Can I take this job?」
％Ｂ
「I might become really busy, but I want to try it... It's a chance to bring new life to the place of our memories.」


Sora
「...No issues.」
Sora
「You should do what you want to do. I'll support you.」

Sora
「You should do what you want to do. I'll support you.」

％Ｂ
「Thank you.」
all
％Ｂ
「...Teacher. I'll... No, the ％Ａ Architectural Firm will accept this job!」

I make my heartfelt declaration to Azuma-san.
