And so Sora really did wake me up from the next morning onward.
％Ｂ
「...Zzz... Zzz... Zzz...」
【Sora】「Morning#NAre you awake?」
【％Ｂ】「Morning. I just woke up.」
【Sora】「Good」
【Sora】_st_0310
【％Ｂ】「Wait, crap! I replied!」
【％Ｂ】_st_0302
【Sora】「Were you really #Nplanning on not #Nreplying on purpose?」
【％Ｂ】「Yeah, I wanted to hear #Nyour voice in the #Nmorning. What a shame...」

％Ｂ
「Hello?」
Sora
『...Is this fine?』
％Ｂ
「Yeah. Morning, Sora.」
Sora
『...Morning.』
％Ｂ
「I like getting to hear your voice first thing in the morning.」
Sora
『...Me too. But we'll stop here for now.』
％Ｂ
「Yeah. There'd be no point to you waking me up if we ended up late from talking on the phone.」
Sora
『...I'll be waiting on the roof for lunch.』
％Ｂ
「Okay. I'll head over right away after class.」
Sora
『...Mm.』

％Ｂ
「Phew...」
Getting to talk to Sora in the morning's gotten me wide awake.
And most importantly, now I've got something to look forward to every morning.
Exams might not be too bad if I get to experience something like this.
％Ｂ
「Now then... Let's get ready and head to school!」
And so, at lunch break...
Sora
「I want to see the stars...」
Seems like Sora is having withdrawal symptoms.
Her desire to look at the sky is even coming when we're eating. 
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Already? Didn't you just look at them yesterday?」
Sora
「If it's just the stars, I can watch them at home...」
Sora
「Since I have to watch the stars everyday.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Is studying going well at least?」
Sora
「It's fine because I blocked off time for studying.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Sounds good.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Wait, so that means you have time to look at stars?」
Sora
「Hehe...」
Sora
「Words are hard but...」
Sora
「I want to see the stars with
Ryou
 you
.
Sora
「It's lonely not having 
Ryou
 you
 beside me when I watch the stars.」
Sora
「I just want to watch the stars with
Ryou
 you
.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Sora...」
Sora
「But we have to wait until after exams.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Let's look at the stars together.」
Sora
「Huh?」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「I was taking a break last night and I was searching up some stars.」

％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「I'm not really an expert on where all the constellations are.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「That's why this app is pretty cool.」
I take out my phone and open the app.
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Do you have the Constellation Catalogue app?」
Sora
「Umhm」
Sora
「I have it too.」
With that, Sora shows me her phone. 
It's a different icon, but it's probably the same thing. 
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「The app will show the stars in the direction you point.」
Sora
「Umhm」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Okay, so if you do this...」
I point my phone to the sky.
And it shows me stars that I shouldn't be able to see in the midday sky.
Sora
「Ooh...」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Despite the bright sky, we can see the stars clearly here.」

Sora
「Amazing...」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「It's definitely an amazing app.」
Sora
「No,
Ryou
 you're
 amazing.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Hmm, me?」
Sora
「I never thought of using the constellation app this way.」
Sora
「I only used it during night.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Make sense given that stars only come out that night.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「When it comes to stars, you really do have a single tracked mind.」
Sora
「I need to level up...」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「It's fine. Besides, take a look. 
Seems like Taurus is over here.」
I point at the sky where my phone is directed at.
Sora
「Orion is also there.」
I come closer to Sora because her phone is quite small.
Our bodies are snug as we look at the screen together.

Sora
「There's Perseus and over there is Cassiopeia.」
Sora begins pointing at the sky too as she rattles of constellation names. 
Her eyes really do glitter when she's looking at the stars.
Sora
「And Polaris's position hasn't changed at all.」
Her face is bascially touching her phone, as she's become entranced in the stars above.
And I think our cheeks are touching.

Sora
「Ah...」
As she notices our proximity, she lets out a shocked voice.
Sora
「I was too engrossed...」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Nah, that's fine. I was able to see the stars wih you.」
Sora
「Umhm」
Sora
「I was able to see the stars with
Ryou
 you
 today.」
Sora
「That makes me happy.」
Sora
「Besides, we're dating, so it's fine.」
Because our cheeks are touching, I can feel her 
smiling.
It's a pleasent and fuzzy feeling. 
And so, we spend our lunch break glued to one another, enjoying the stars in the bright skies above.
