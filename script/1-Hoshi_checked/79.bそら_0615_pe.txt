I'm at the mall to buy some everyday necessities.
％Ｂ
「Tissues, detergent... What else do I need again?」
I have to stay on top of restocking stuff like this, since I'll be living alone for a while still.

％Ｂ
「I'm almost out of shampoo, so I should get some...」
％Ｂ
「...Huh?」
I spot a familiar-looking girl walking in front of me.
％Ｂ
「Ousaka!」
She turns around, and it's just who I thought it was.
％Ｂ
「Yo!」
Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「Fancy seeing you here. Out shopping?」
Sora
「...For books. What about you?


」
％Ｂ
「Me? I'm going to the supermarket to pick up some everyday supplies. Living by myself's a pain 'cause I have to buy all this stuff myself.」


Sora
「...Those are cheaper at the drugstore.」

％Ｂ
「Are they?」
Sora
「...There's a super-cheap drugstore over there. I'll show you.」
％Ｂ
「Wha, you sure? You're going to the bookstore, aren't you?」
Sora
「...I can get books afterward. No issues.」
％Ｂ
「Okay. Yeah, could you show me, then? I still don't really know the stores here that well, since everything's different.」


Sora
「...This way.」
all
％Ｂ
「Man, that place really was cheap!」
The drugstore Ousaka showed me had everything I needed, and it was cheaper than at the supermarket too.

It sold shampoo and conditioner in sets, and stuff like two-liter bottles of tea for 98 yen.

And luckily enough, there just happened to be a limited-time sale on tissues when we got there.

％Ｂ
「That was a good place. Thanks for showing me.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「You're going to the bookstore, right? I'll come with you.」
Sora
「...You sure?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, I might as well. I wanna get a magazine or something to read when I've got time to kill. Come on, let's go.」

Sora
「...*nod*」
all
Ousaka and I bought a book and a magazine respectively, and we were given vouchers for a lottery with our purchases.\n\r

They're apparently doing it in the middle of the street.
％Ｂ
「Five vouchers for one try. How many'd you get?」
Sora
「...Four.」
％Ｂ
「I got two, so I guess that means there's only one try between the two of us... No, wait a second.」
I think I got a few back at the drugstore too.
％Ｂ
「Let's see... One, two, three... I've got four more here, so that makes ten total. All right, we can do one try each now.」

Sora
「...I don't think we'll get anything impressive.」
％Ｂ
「Now don't be that way. Let's try our luck.」
all
We head to where the lottery is. They have the prizes out on display.
％Ｂ
「Let's see, the special prize is... a hot springs vacation!? Look, "Indulge yourself with soothing hot springs under a sky filled to the brim with stars. For one pair"!」

Sora
「...Ooh.」
Her eyes are sparkling.
She must be excited about the "sky filled to the brim with stars" part.
all
The people in front of us spin the lottery wheel.
A white ball pops out.
Lottery Staff
「And heeere's your consolation prize!」
They leave in bitter defeat after being handed a packet of tissues.
％Ｂ
「So the consolation prize is tissues... Yeah, that's pretty normal. Like you said, I doubt we'll get anything too... Wait, what? Ousaka?」

Lottery Staff
「Yes, we're ready for the next person!」
Sora
「...Two spins.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, she's already in line...」
Sora
「...
Ryou, hurry
Hurry
.」
％Ｂ
「R-Right...」
all
She's just raring to go, despite her skepticism earlier...

Lottery Staff
「Oh, a couple. No one's won the special prize hot springs vacation yet, so good luck!」

％Ｂ
「Uh... No, we're not...」
Sora
「...」
Ousaka's gone red.
I'm kinda surprised she has reactions like this...
％Ｂ
「Uhh... Who's gonna go first?」
Sora
「...I'll go first.」
％Ｂ
「All right. Good luck!」
She's so motivated...
Sora
「...Hmh.」
She spins the wheel with gusto.
A blue ball pops out.
Lottery Staff
「Oh, congratulations!」
％Ｂ
「Ohh! That's awesome, Ousaka!」
Sora
「...Mhmh.」
She turns back toward me and gives me the usual smug look and thumbs-up.
Did she seriously win the special prize!?
Lottery Staff
「The blue ball is the fifth-place prize. Three boxes of tissues!」
Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「Well, uh... That's better than just a small packet of tissues... Yeah.」
Her smug look immediately became an incredibly dissatisfied expression.
I get why though.
％Ｂ
「All right, leave the rest to me. I'll get revenge for you.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
all
Lottery Staff
「Now then, Mr. Boyfriend, this is your chance to show off your cool side in front of your girlfriend!」

％Ｂ
「No, we really aren't dating...」
I wish they'd stop... It's kinda messing with me...
％Ｂ
「Phew... All right!」
I pump myself up and grab the handle.
Will Ousaka be happy if I actually win the special prize?

Oh, but... say I do end up winning it. Who's gonna go on the trip...?

I'll have been the one who won it, but Ousaka's the one who wanted it in the first place...
It's for a pair, so...
...So Ousaka and I would go together...?
all
No, but there's no way...
She'd probably go with a family member or something.
No...! But it's Ousaka. Maybe─
「You gave me your voucher, so I'm going with you.」
─I could see her saying something like that...!
No...! But it's Ousaka. Maybe─
「You gave me your voucher, so I'm going with you.」
─I could see her saying something like that...!
all
Lottery Staff
「Excuse me, sir, if you would spin it...」
％Ｂ
「Wha...!? Oh... I'm sorry...」
I psych myself back up again and spin the wheel.
The ball is... yellow!
Lotter Staff
「Ohhh!? It-It's...!」
Sora
「Hgh...!?」
Did I do it!?
Did I pull it off!?
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「I got a keychain...」
I got the fourth place prize, which leaves me with this cat keychain. 
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Well... I guess they wouldn't make getting the top prize so easy.」
Oh well, you can't win them all.
Or at least that's how it should be...
Sora
「Meow...」
Ousaka is gawking at the keychain, as she's holding the packet of tissues. 

all
Well, it is a cute cat design. 
But the cat's probably not her main focus.
So that means she's interested in...
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「You like the star on its stomach...?」
Sora
「Meow...」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Do you know this cat?」
Sora
「...?」
She stares back at me with wide eyes. 
Her silence seems to be a pretty telling answer. 
Sora
「Shionya」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Shionya?」
Sora
「It's Shionaga Market's unoffical mascot.」
Sora
「The mascot... is really cute.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Cute, huh...」
all
I raise the keychain to eye level.
Shionya's eyes up close are soulless and frankly it creeps me out.
Ousaka on the other hand...

Sora
「Meow.」
She just seems taken away by it.
％Ｂ
「Do you wanna trade?」
Sora
「...?」
％Ｂ
「I mean, you like this better anyways.」
Sora
「That's
Ryou's
your
prize. This is mine.」
She hugs the tissue packets while saying that.
％Ｂ
「Then humour me this.
How about we trade the keychain and packet of tissues?」
Sora
「You're taking pity on me...」
％Ｂ
「I'm not taking pity on you.
I came here to buy daily necessities and tissues seems better to me in comparison.」

Sora
「But you already bought five.」
％Ｂ
「Tch...」
Ousaka has a point.
I bought five boxes of tissues before this because they were having a limited time offer at the drug store. 
％Ｂ
「You know, I can always use more tissues.
It's not like five boxes will be enough for me.」
％Ｂ
「Think of it as helping me.
You still up for a trade?」
Sora
「Hmm...」
Seems like it's troubling her.
Sora
「If
Ryou says
you say
so...」
％Ｂ
「Thanks a bunch!」
I take the tissue packet as I give her the keychain.

Sora
「Wow...」
Her eyes are gleaming as she stares at the keychain. 
％Ｂ
「You like it?」
Sora
「Umhm」
％Ｂ
「That's good then.」
Sora
「
Ryou
Hmm
...」
％Ｂ
「Yeah?」
Sora
「Thanks...」
％Ｂ
「I should be thanking you.」
％Ｂ
「Well then, do you want to go back or what?」
Sora
「How about
Ryou
you
?」
％Ｂ
「Well.. holding all these boxes is kind of a hassle. 
How about we go in and grab a bite to eat?」
Sora
「Umhm」
％Ｂ
「So is there anything in particular you want to eat?」
Sora
「Hamburger.」
％Ｂ
「You want to go to the hamburger joint from before?
You like it?」
Sora
「Umhm. It was delicious.」
％Ｂ
「Alright, then let's go get some burgers!」
The restaurant is jam packed and there's no empty seats available.
That leaves us no other option but ordering take out and eating out by the quiet sidewalk.


Sora
「Take out...」
The existence of take out seems to have shocked Ousaka.
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「It might be a bit rude, but how about we eat as we walk back?」
Sora
「Wild...」
That being said, Ousaka instantly shifts her attention to her burger.
I guess that's becauase it's the Big Mack she chose and ordered herself.


all
I open the wrapping paper and take a bite into my burger.
Ousaka follows my lead and pauses.
Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「What's wrong? You don't want to eat it?」
Sora
「Cheers... Hamuh...」
She's a bit reluctant. 
I guess that's a given because of her dislike of pickles. 
％Ｂ
「Just avoid the pickles if you do see any.」
Sora
「Umhm... Ahmuh... Mgh... Nh!」
Ousaka freezes again and glares at me again.  
Her lips are pursed. 
She must have bitten into a pickle. 
％Ｂ
「Take it out then.」
Sora
「Ngh...」
She shows me her half eaten burger. 
There's a pickle hanging off the edge with some bite marks on it.

Sora
「Ngh...」
％Ｂ
「Huh?」
She's basically forcing the burger onto me now.
％Ｂ
「Wait... you want me to eat it?」
Sora
「Umhm」
I'm still a bit reluctant as Ousaka puts the burger closer to my mouth. 

％Ｂ
「You want me to eat it like this?」
Sora
「Hmm...」
Like with the Yakisoba bread, there's no way I can weasel my way out.
％Ｂ
「Okay... I'll take a bite.」
Sora
「Ahh...」
％Ｂ
「Hamuh...」
I bite the pickle and take it out of the burger.
This is a textbook indirect kiss. 
And a sweet and sour one at that. 
％Ｂ
「Ngh... Guh... There, I ate it.」
Sora
「Mm...」
Ousaka checks to make sure there aren't any other pickles. 
Satisfied, she starts eating again.
As for me, my heart is beating like crazy.
First the Yakisoba bread and now the pickles...
We've had two indirect kisses now.
Does Ousaka really not care about this at all?
Oh well, not like I should get my hopes up anyways. 
Sora
「Ngh!!
％Ｂ
「Huh, what's wrong?」
Sora
「...」
Ousaka purses her lips and gives me a bitter look.
Subsequently, I hear hard crunching.

％Ｂ
「Ah, Big Macks have two pickles in them.」

Sora
「Augh...」
She hits my shoulder as if she's protesting. 
Oh well, I'll let it slide this time.
