「Thank you very much for today!!」
I swiftly slot in my time card.
Firm Staff A
「Oh? You're leaving pretty early today.」
％Ｂ
「I'm sorry, but I have some plans today.」
Azuma
「It has to be a woman.」
％Ｂ
「You're right on the mark, but that doesn't bother me anymore. And it's not just any woman. It's my wife.」

all
Firm Staff A
「Dammit, he's showing off his newlywed-ness again!」
％Ｂ
「You should hurry and get married too. Please. Anyway, thank you very much!」

％Ｂ
「I'm hooome.」
Marika
「Welcome hooome♪」
％Ｂ
「...What?」
I don't know what to say.
...A bunny?
Marika
「H-Huh～? ...Did I surprise you? Th-That's weird～ I thought... something like this would make you happy～」


％Ｂ
「Are those... bunnygirl ears?」
Marika
「Y-Yeah, they are... I heard somewhere that cosplaying might be a good way to celebrate a man's birthday... And you liked it back when I did that Alice cosplay before too～」


Oh, whoops. Marika looks a little worried.
％Ｂ
「Marika!」
Marika
「Y-Yeeees～」
％Ｂ
「I was just surprised... 'cause I didn't think you'd ever do something like that yourself. Um... It looks really good on you.」


Marika
「Really? Am I cute?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, you are. I think you're the cutest bunny in the world.」

Marika
「Wh-Whaaat? ...I think that's exaggerating... since real bunnies are cuter...」

％Ｂ
「Nope. You're cuter.」
Marika
「Oh really... I-I'm glad～」
She sighs in relief.
She's always so worried...
％Ｂ
「Then, Marika!」
Marika
「Y-Yes!」
％Ｂ
「Thank you.」
Marika
「A-Aahh～」
I hug her tight.
She clings to me feebly.
％Ｂ
「You wanting to make me happy makes me happy. Um, well...」

It's a little embarrassing, but I look Marika in the eye and smile right at her.
％Ｂ
「I love you, Marika.」
Marika
「Mmh... Chu...」
And we kiss.
Marika
「W-Wah～ ...I-I'm so happy～」
Marika
「Hnnhh, it was embarrassing, but I'm glad I tried this～」

Marika
「I was so worried that you might be creeped out～」
％Ｂ
「What are you talking about? I was surprised, but that was just 'cause it was sudden.」

％Ｂ
「There's no way I'd be creeped out by anything you did, Marika... 'cause I love you.」

Marika
「Mhm... Mhm...」
％Ｂ
「Wait, what? ...Y-You're gonna cry?」
Marika
「I'm not crying... because I'm happy. My eyes are just all watery because I'm a bunny rabbit...」

Marika
「E-Ehehehe.」
She wipes at her eyes and smiles.
Marika
「Oh, then... Please, come inside... I'll take your bag for you too.」

％Ｂ
「Oh, thanks. Here you go, then.」
Marika
「Wow, it's so heavy～」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, I've got my laptop in there today. It's supposed to be a pretty light one, but...」

Marika
「Whaaat? I'd dislocate my shoulder if I had to carry this around.」
％Ｂ
「Your bag's plenty heavy too, though.」
Marika
「Whaaat, it's nothing like this... It's not that heavy, because it's mostly little things inside.」

She then heaves my bag along.
Marika
「Here we go... Hehehe. Thanks for all your hard work.」
Marika
「Oh, I'll take your necktie too!」
％Ｂ
「You're even gonna do that?」
Marika
「Yep! Because today's your birthday! You can let the bunny handle everything!」

％Ｂ
「Then please.」
I stick my chest out so she can take my necktie.
Marika
「O-Okaay... U-Umm... This goes here, and that goes there, so...」


She looks a little lost on what to do with the necktie.
Marika
「L-Like this!」
Squeeze!
％Ｂ
「Guegh!」
Marika
「A-Aaahhh! I'm sorry, I tightened it～!」

Marika
「You pull this one, right? Ahaha...!」
She frantically loosens my tie.
％Ｂ
「I was almost killed by my own wife...」
Marika
「That's not true, it wasn't on purpose～」
Marika
「A-Ahahaha... Your necktie is now off～ I will also be taking your suit～」

all
She laughs to try to smooth it over and takes my jacket from me.
She neatly places it on a hanger.
Marika
「Then, p-please～ ...Have a seat～」
％Ｂ
「Okaaay.」
Marika
「As you can see, dinner is also ready.」
％Ｂ
「Whoah!?」
all
I sit down at the living room table.
There are lots of dishes laid out. They look good enough to be served at a hotel restaurant.

Marika
「Ehehe! I did my best.」
Marika
「Umm, this is salmon and celery marinade. You like salmon, right?」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, I love it. It looks really good with the fat still on it. What are these little green things?」

Marika
「They're capers. It apparently makes for a good accent to the flavor.」
Marika
「And also, some corn potage soup.」
％Ｂ
「Whoa, it's so thick...」
Marika
「The mixer we got as a wedding present really came in handy.」
Marika
「And for the main course, roast beef...ish!」
％Ｂ
「Roast beef-ish?」
Marika
「Yeah. You need an oven to make real roast beef... but you can make something kind of like it with aluminum foil and a frying pan. So it's roast beef-ish.」


％Ｂ
「Wow... But it looks good.」
The cut face of the meat is just slightly pink.
It looks moist and soft.
Marika
「And, and, I have a drink too. Bubbly bubbly champagne!」

％Ｂ
「Whoaaah! That's awesome!」
Marika
「I asked the employee at the store what kind would be easy to drink. This is only 3 percent alcohol, and it's apparently crisp and sweet. That way, I thought I'd be able to drink it too...」


％Ｂ
「Oh? You're gonna drink with me today?」
Marika
「Yeah, since it's a special occasion.」
Marika
「I thought it'd be nice... if we could make a toast with the same drink.」
％Ｂ
「Really... That makes me so happy. Thank you. This must've been a ton of work, right?」

Marika
「It just became really fun while I was doing it, so it just got more and more elaborate. So, yeah, it was a lot of work, but it was also so much fun～♪」
 
 
Marika
「Hehe... Then that cute bunny's going to pour this for you. Oh, I need to open this cork first.」
 
％Ｂ
「You really are so cute and amazing... You're the bunny in the galaxy」

Marika
「Haha... Then about having this bunny serve you some drinks. Ah, before that happens, you better open the cork.」

Bunny Marika grabs the champagne.
She puts her fingers on the cork, and uses all her strength to...
Marika
「...Huh? I can't get it out... Just a second. Hnnnnghhh...」
 
％Ｂ
「You sure you can do it? Want me to help?」

Marika
「It-It's okay! It's almost out～! Hnnnnnnnnghhh...!」

all
Shhpop!!
Marika
「It's out!!」
％Ｂ
「Oh, Marika, watch out...!」
Marika
「Nyah!?」
all
The champagne cork bounces and hits her forehead directly.

％Ｂ
「Y-You okay!?」
Marika
「Piiiih～～～～ ...I-I'm okay... It didn't hurt that much... It was just surprising...」

Marika
「But I said "Nyah" even though I'm a bunny... I wonder what would've been the correct thing to say...」

％Ｂ
「What? That's what you're worried about?」
Watching her flush red as she puzzles over that's just adorable.

Marika
「Please go "there there"～」
％Ｂ
「There, there, Marika. That hurt, didn't it?」

I pet her forehead.
Marika
「Hehe... I'm okay now!」
She cheers up immediately.
Marika
「Oh, then, I'll get the glasses. The freezer, the freezer...」

all
She struts over to the kitchen and grabs glasses for the two of us.\n\r

The two glasses have been chilled completely in the freezer.
Marika
「I'll start pouring the drinks then!」
％Ｂ
「Hmmmh, it just all feels so high class...」
Marika
「These are the glasses we got from Narusawa-san as a wedding present. They're apparently a famous European brand.」

％Ｂ
「You just gotta hand it to people like her who know their stuff like that.」
Marika
「They look really nice, don't they? I think they're perfect for something like this.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah. We'll have to thank Narusawa when we see her.」
Marika
「And so...」
Marika
「Mhm... Then... to celebrate Ryousuke's birthday... Cheers!」
Marika
「Mhm... Then... to celebrate your birthday... Cheers!」
％Ｂ
「Cheers!」
We gently clink our glasses together.
The celebratory sound echoes through the room.
Marika
「Nkh, nkh... Oh, this is so good!」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, it is. It's sweet, but not too much...」
Marika
「It's like high-class grape juice. I can drink this.」

％Ｂ
「You'll still get drunk if you drink too much, you know.」
Marika
「It's okay, I'm an adult～」
She giggles and sips at the champagne.
Marika
「Please feel free to eat the food too.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, I'll dig in!」
％Ｂ
「So many choices... but I'll start with the meat.」
Marika
「I know you like your meat. I'll cut it for you. How much do you want?」

％Ｂ
「I want a really thick piece.」
Marika
「Whaaat? About this much?」
％Ｂ
「No, I'm talking like, centimeters thick.」
Marika
「This much? Will this fit in your mouth?」
％Ｂ
「Easy-peasy. Here, just jam it in.」
Marika
「Then... here you go. Say "ahhh"...」

She cuts the meat and carefully holds it out to me.
％Ｂ
「Hamh...!」
Marika
「Wow! In one mouthful!」
％Ｂ
「Mgmgh... It's good! This tastes pretty refreshing too.」

Marika
「Yeah, because it's red meat, so it doesn't have as many calories as you'd expect. The seasoning is mostly soy sauce, so it's refreshing too.」

％Ｂ
「Mhm, mhm. It tastes great.」
％Ｂ
「Then I think I'll cut your portion too.」
Marika
「Oh, then please do～」
％Ｂ
「Uhh, is about this thick a piece okay?」
Marika
「Mmm, I think a little less might be nice...」
％Ｂ
「Huh? Like this? It's only about a millimeter thick...」

Marika
「This bunny rabbit's mouth is small.」
％Ｂ
「That's true. Then here...」
Marika
「Ahhh...」
Marika
「Oh, it's so good!」
She smiles as she chews with her little mouth.
She really looks like a bunny.
％Ｂ
「This salmon's incredible too. I love the sharp taste of the capers.」
Marika
「Really? How do you like the soup?」
％Ｂ
「Slurp... Mm, it's good! It's thick, like the kind you'd get at a restaurant. You have some too, Marika. I'll cool it off for you.」


％Ｂ
「Fhh, fhh... Say "ahhh."」
Marika
「Ahaha, thank yooou. Ahhh～」
all
We enjoy the lavish feast.
We smile all the way through dinnertime.
％Ｂ
「Phew... And I'm done.」
Marika
「Yes, me too.」
I figured it'd take a while, since there was a lot of food, and we were taking our time to enjoy it...\n\r

But we had finished our dinner before I knew it.
I just couldn't stop eating with how good it was.
Marika
「I have cake for dessert. Oh, but we just ate, so... maybe it could wait until the food's settled a bit?」


％Ｂ
「Nah, I'll have it now. Sweet things and your cakes go in a different stomach.」

Marika
「Oh, I get what you mean～ Then wait just a second, okay?」
Marika
「Okay, I'll go get the cake ready now～」
Her bunny ears are swaying back and forth as she's in high spirits.
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Where did you even get those bunny ears?」
Marika
「Oh～ I got them at the place near the station. "Passion Palace" is the name.」
That's a bargain store that's open 24 hours a day. 
Makes sense that they would sell party goods too.
Marika
「You know... these bunny ears weren't the only thing I bought.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「So you mean...?」
Marika
「They actually had the whole costume. You know, like the bunny dress? The ears were only a part of it.」


％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Oh, so it's part of a set.」
Marika
「Yeah, like that.」
Marika
「I thought of wearing the whole costume... But I thought about what would happen if I go all out with the cosplay...」

Marika
「If I go that far, I'm afraid that would be the point of no return for us～...」
Marika cosplaying in her bunny dress...
all
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「...」
An image conjures up in my mind.
There's no beating around the bush, that would be so damn cute...
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Marika.」
Marika
「Y-yeah?」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「I want to see it.」
Marika
「S-sure～」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「I mean, you bought it anyways, right?」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Might as well put it to good use.」
Marika
「T-true～...」
Marika
「But umm... it really makes my chest stand out～...」
Marika
「It's a bit embarrassing... Ah, what do I do～... I'm not sure if I can do this...」

Marika is fidgeting from her internal struggle.
I might have to give her another push.
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Marika...」
Marika
「Augh...」
I gently grab her shoulder.
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Marika, I want to see you in your bunny dress.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Can you please wear it? For me?」
Marika
「Hah～...」
Marika
「Sure... if you say so～... I'll wear it then...」

％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Oh, you will?」
Marika
「Are you sure you won't go crazy?」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「I promise.」
Marika
「And you won't laugh?」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「I won't. But I will be very happy if you do.」
Marika
「Okay... then...」
Marika
「I'll wear it, even if it's embarrassing!」
Marika's face becomes full of vigour. 

Marika
「Okay, can you head into the bedroom for a bit～?」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「O-okay then.」
all
Marika is forcefully pushing me.
Marika
「It's embarrassing if you watch me get ready.」
Marika
「I'll tell you when I'm ready, so hold on for a bit.」
Marika
「Oh and I'll make sure to get the cake ready too.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「S-sure thing.」
I head to the bedroom to wait.
I think about going on my phone, 
but I'm too nervous to even do that.
I guess I'll just patiently wait...
Marika
「I-I'm ready～...」
From the door, I hear her feeble voice.
My heart is pounding like crazy. I head back to the living room and...
Marika
「T-tada!」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Holy shit!!!」
I see Marika, who is completely done up in her bunny dress costume.
She's holding a delicious looking birthday cake. 
With a start, the bunny ears are fluttering.
Marika
「A-ahaha～ This sorta feels...」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Marika, umm...」
Marika
「Y-yeah...」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「It looks delicious.」
Marika
「Thanks a bunch～ Glad the cake looks good～...」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Oh, that's not what I mean. Well, the cake looks delicious too...」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Marika, you're the most delicious thing in front me.」
Marika
「H-huh!?」
Marika
「No, you can't do that～ The dessert is on the way too...」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「But your just so damn cute, I just want to sink my teeth into it.」
Marika
「T-thanks～...」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「It fits you well. You look so cute.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Having such a cute bunny wish me a happy birthday is the best.」

Marika
「I-it's not that big of a deal...」
Marika
「Ehehe... but I'm happy you enjoy it. I'm glad I had the courage to put this on.」

Marika
「Alright, here we go. Please take a seat～」
Marika pats on the cushion as if inviting me over there.
Marika
「This is your birthday seat.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Alright, here goes nothing.」
I sit on the fluffy cushion.
The scent of cream and strawberry catches my nostrils.
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「There's lots of strawberrys, how splendid.」
Marika
「Yeah? I put a lot work into it.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Did you make this Marika?」
Marika
「Ehehe... well, yeah...」
Marika
「I rarely make cake, so I was scared it would turn out bad～...」

％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「No way, it looks so damn good though. It's like it's store bought.」

Marika
「Well, it isn't.」
Marika
「Well... I did buy the sponge base... I did the cream and fruit decor myself.」

％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「I mean, that's still impressive. I couldn't be any happier.」
Marika
「You're exaggerating～」
Marika
「Wel, I'm glad you like it. I even wrote on the plate～」

Marika
「It was kinda hard, so you might not be able to read it～...」
There are words of celebration written on the chocloate plate.
She put her all into writing it, and that's the most important, honestly.
Marika
「Hey, Ryousuke...」
Marika
「Hey...」
Marika
「Want to light a candle?」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Yeah, sure.」
Marika
「How many should we put on there? I don't think it can just be the your age...」

％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「If we go over 20, that might be a fire hazard.」
Marika
「Ahaha, you're right～ 
Balance and getting the colours to match are both important.」
She carefully puts the candles on the cake.
She finally gets out the lighter to light the candles. 
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Ah...」
Marika
「Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday dear Ryousuke～」

Marika
「Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday, Happy birthday! Happy birthday to you!」


With her gentle and melodic voice, she wishes me a happy birthday.
Marika
「Alright, blow out the candles!」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Okay.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Fuh!」
Marika
「Wow!」
Marika
「Happy birthday! Congrats!」
With a breath, I blow out the candles as I hear Marika clapping.
Marika
「Ngh, Chuu...」
She gives me a light kiss after.
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Thanks, Marika.」
Marika
「No problem.」
There's a gleam in front of me.
It's coming from the perpetually cute bunny custome.
Marika
「Oh, and this...」
％Ｂ
「It's... a birthday card?」
Marika
「Mhm. Can I read it out loud?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. I wanna hear.」
She holds out a handmade birthday card.
She flips it open to reveal a hand-drawn illustration and a message.

Marika
「"Happy birthday!!!\nI'm very happy to celebrate your birthday with you as your wife for the first time."」


Marika
「"Thank you so much for making me your wife. Please let me keep celebrating your birthday from now on, too. Please let me be with you forever and ever."」


％Ｂ
「Marika...」
Marika
「Ahaha, it's kind of embarrassing...」
Her message warms my heart.
I accept the birthday card from her and read it over and over to myself.
I'll definitely treasure this for the rest of my life.
Marika
「Okay, okay. I'l cut some cake now. How much do you want?」

％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Oh thanks. I'll have a quarter I guess.」
Marika
「Wow! I'll cut a big slice for you then.」
She uses the knife to neatly cut a slice.
Marika
「Well, umm... How about this...」
Marika
「Here you go, say ah.」
She gently picks up the piece with a spoon and as she holds it in front of my mouth.
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Hamuh.」
I manage to fit the somewhat large piece in my mouth.
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「It's good!」
Marika
「Phew～...」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「You feeding me made it way too delicious though.」
Marika
「It's your birthday. That's just a special service the bunny can provide.」
Marika
「Alright, here's another piece.」
Marika
「Say ahh...」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Ah...」
She gives me another piece to savour.
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「The texture is just so fluffy. That's what makes it so delicious.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Also, the cream is super light.」
Marika
「I tried to go not overboard on the sweetness. I heard guys don't like it too heavy.」

％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「I wouldn't mind eating this cake over and over again.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Hm, can I take the large strawberry?」
Marika
「Yeah, take whatever you want.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Ah...」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Damn... is this even a regular strawberry?」
Marika
「It's just a regular store bought strawberry. But I did infuse it with syrup.」

％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Ah, so it's a syrup coating.」
Marika
「Yeah, and I blended it with some liqueur. It's something that would suit grown ups.」

％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Ah, so that's what that aftertaste was. This is seriously good...」

Marika
「Please eat as much as you want.」
Upon Marika's insistence, I continue gulping down the cake.
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Are you going to eat some, Marika?」
Marika
「Yeah, I guess. I'm getting hungry just looking at it.」


％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「I'll cut you a piece. How much do you want?」
Marika
「Hmm... I'll have a sixth, then.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「That's a lot for you.」
Marika
「Ehehe, when it comes to sweets, I can afford to cheat a bit.」
I carefully cut out a slice for her.
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Here, for you.」
Marika
「Alright, time to taste for myself.」
Marika
「Hamuh... Ngh...」
Marika
「It's really sweet～」
Marika
「I can't stop～ Hamuh, Hamuh...」
With her small mouth, Marika chews away.
Marika
「It's so good～」
That smile lights up her face.
Spending this time with her is pure bliss.
％Ｂ
「I'm so glad I married you...」
I quietly mutter that as I reflect on everything.
Marika
「Huh, why are you brinnig that up?」
％Ｂ
「I mean, that's been on my mind... well, it's been something I've always been thinking about.」

％Ｂ
「Marika, you're the world's best bunny and the world's best wife.」

Marika
「Ahaha... are you drunk?」
Marika
「But... I agree. I've been thinking that you're the world's best husband.」

Marika has a merry smile as she's saying that.
Marika
「Hah～ I might be a bit drunk too...」
Marika
「Did I use too much liqueur for the strawberries...?」
Her cheeks are slightly flushed.
It's really sexy.
Marika
「It's getting a little hot...」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, you're right...」
We inch closer as we whisper to each other.
Before we know it, we're right up against one another.
Marika
「Mmh... Mmchu, chu... mlmlh... chu... nnh... Hehe... This is just a bit sweet too... Slrp, chu, mmlhh... Chuph, mmchu...」


We playfully lick at each other's lips.
We kiss each other's cheeks and lips, lick at our noses...
Marika
「...Nnh... Ahn, nh, afh...」
And I touch her body, enjoying the round softness.
Marika
「Mmlh, chuuuh... Mmfh... Your tongue... tastes so good...」

％Ｂ
「You can lick it as much as you want. And I'll do the same...」
Marika
「Mmchu, chu... Slurp... Chu... Mlh, chu, slurp... Chuph, mmchu...」

It's more like we're sucking on each other's tongues than licking.
Marika's saliva is flowing into my mouth.\n\r
I just can't get enough of how much of a mess we're making on each other's mouths as we show our love.
Marika
「Hauh～」
Marika's cheeks are completely flushed.
And it isn't just because of the alcohol...
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Marika...」
Marika
「Y-yes～...」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「You made a wonderful meal and an amazing cake. Thank you so much, it was so delicious.」

％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「But you know... I'm still not satisfied.」
Marika
「You ate so much and you even ate dessert...」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Yeah.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「But I want you, Marika.」
Marika
「You're being quite greedy...」
Marika
「But I've been feeling the same way...」
Marika
「I want to keep celebrating with you... I want to make sure your soul is completely fulfilled.」

％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Marika... can I keep going?」
Marika
「Yeah... it's fine.」
With bewitching eyes, she gives me a smile.
They really are charming.
Marika
「Please enjoy yourself with the bunny～...」
She timidly lean towards me.
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Marika, I love you...」
Marika
「Ngh... Chuu... Guh... Egh... I love you... Ngh...」
