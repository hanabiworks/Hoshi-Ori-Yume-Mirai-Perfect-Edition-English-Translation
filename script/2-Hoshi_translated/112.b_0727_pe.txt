Sora frowns as she takes her hoodie off.
Sora
「...Cough... Cough...」
％Ｂ
「You okay?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「You've still got some around your mouth. I'll wipe it, so look up.」
Sora
「...Mm...」
She closes her eyes and tilts her head upward a little.
There's white semen stuck on her cheeks, which are a little flushed from her coughing.
％Ｂ
「...」
I can't help but feel a little horny again when I see her like this.\n\r

This is ridiculous. I just came twice already...
％Ｂ
「Sora...」
Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「...」
Sora
「...Your phone.」
％Ｂ
「...Right.」
all
Sora＿ＣＳ
「Zzz... Zzz...」
I open my eyes and the first thing I see is Sora's sleeping face.
Rgiht, we deicded to stay the night here because of he risk of a potenial typhoon.
Sora＿ＣＳ
「Zzz... Zzz...」
With her so close, I hear her peaceful breaths.
The morning sun streams through the crack in the curtain, signaling the pasisng of the typhoon from last night.
I recall what Sora said last night.
──And when I wake up, Ryou will be the first thing I see.
──And when I wake up, you will be the first thing I see.。
──I feel so blessed...
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
（She has a point...）
Sora was the first thing I saw when I woke up. 
This only brings me so much happiness.
Before I know, I'm smiling like crazy.
I brush the bangs hanging on her head.
It feels so smooth and comfortable.
Sora＿ＣＳ
「Ngh... Hmm...」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Ah...」
Sora＿ＣＳ
「Ngh... 
Ryou
Ah
...」
Sora slowly opens her eyes and faintly glances at me.
For a while, she freezes as if she's thinking of something.
But it only lasts for a few seconds.
She throws me an earnest smile.
Sora＿ＣＳ
「Good morning.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Yeah, good morning.」
Sora＿ＣＳ
「Hmph...」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Hmm? What's the laugh for?」
Sora＿ＣＳ
「When I woke up, 
Ryou was 
you were
there.」
Sora＿ＣＳ
「I thought it was a dream, but it wasn't.」
Sora＿ＣＳ
「I was so happy that I laughed.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「What are the odds, me too.」
I laugh as well, and give Sora a good morning kiss.
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Good morning, Sora」
Sora＿ＣＳ
「Ngh... another greeting.」
With that, Sora returns my kiss.
To be able to have so muchh bliss in the morning...
I just feel like lying in the futon all day with Sora.
However...
％Ｂ
「Hmm?」
Sora
「Your phone is ringing...」
％Ｂ
「Who's calling this early?」
all
I pick up my phone, which is by the futon.
％Ｂ
「...Shuuichi?」
He's not someone who would call this early for no reason.
He might have something he needs to talk to me about...
_smh_st_02
_smh_st_btn02
_smh_st_02
_smh_st_btn05
％Ｂ
「Hello?」
Shuuichi
『
Ryousuke
Hey
! Come to school right away!』
No greeting or anything.
This seems really serious.
％Ｂ
「What's wrong? What are you yelling for so early in the―」
Shuuichi
『Just come! There's a problem with the cardboard!』
％Ｂ
「What? The cardboard!?」
As in, the cardboard everyone collected for us!?
Shuuichi
『And tell Ousaka to come here right away too! I don't know how to get in touch with her! I'm having Shinozaki tell the others.』

％Ｂ
「G-Got it!」
_smh_st_04
I hang up and turn toward Sora.
％Ｂ
「There's apparently some kind of problem. We need to go to school right away.」

Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「Shuuichi! What happened!?」
Sora and I come to the classroom in the old school building.
The others are all already here, including Shuuichi.
Their expressions are all cloudy and dark, in stark contrast to the beautiful post-hurricane weather.

Marika
「Oh... Uuh～」
％Ｂ
「What's wrong? What happened?」
Natsuki
「...There was a leak.」
％Ｂ
「Wha... A leak?」
all
Shuuichi
「...The hurricane last night apparently blew off part of this building's roof. There's a lot of water that's leaked into the classrooms.」
％Ｂ
「...Wait, so you mean the cardboard's...」

Sora
「...
Ryou
Look
...」
Sora points at the corner.
all
％Ｂ
「Oh...」
She's indicating the stack of cardboard that everyone worked so hard to collect.\n\r

Which now just is a soaking wet mess...
％Ｂ
「...You've... You've gotta be kidding me...」
I look up at the roof. There's a big black stain right above the stack of cardboard.

Even now, there are blackened droplets of water dripping down from above.
Shuuichi
「...Dammit... This is my bad... I knew the old school building was deteriorating. I should've known this could happen... I don't know how I can apologize...」


Misa
「No... I do not believe it to be your fault, Shuuichi-san.」
Touko
「Seriously. No one could predict the roof getting blown off. This isn't anyone's fault.」


Shuuichi
「But...」
％Ｂ
「No one thinks it's your fault.」
all
I approach the mountain of cardboard.
I try to pick up the sheet at the very top. It tears under its own weight.

Rikka
「It doesn't look usable.」
％Ｂ
「...No... That's not true.」
Marika
「Wha...?」
I pull away the wet cardboard starting from the top.
The sheets at the top tear easily, but once I get lower down, I find more and more that are either just deformed or slightly wet.
％Ｂ
「There's still cardboard toward the bottom that looks usable.」
Misa
「Is there really!?」
The others also walk up to the cardboard.
Marika
「You're right. Look at this one. I don't think it's that wet.」
Rikka
「This one's only wet at the edge, so we could probably use it if we cut it.」

Touko
「What the heck, a lot of it looks usable.」
％Ｂ
「Let's start by sorting the cardboard into what looks usable and what doesn't, and we'll let the usable ones dry out in the sun.」
all
Sora counts the sheets of cardboard drying in the sun.
all
％Ｂ
「We were able to collect more cardboard than we originally planned, right?」

Shuuichi
「Yeah. So we wouldn't have to worry in case we ran into issues cutting the shapes out.」
all
There's a lot of cardboard that's absolutely unusable, but there's a lot more that survived.

I just hope there's still enough...
％Ｂ
「What do you think, Sora? Do you think we still have enough?」
Sora writes down her cardboard count into a notebook and puts the pen down.

And then―
Sora
「...Mm.」
She gives us a thumbs-up.
Sora
「...Just barely enough.」
all
Marika
「Hahhh～...」
Natsuki
「Phew...」
Misa
「Sigh...」
We all breathe out in relief.
all
Shuuichi
「Honestly... I was really worried earlier. Looks like we'll be able to get started on the construction still, then. That's a relief.」


Rikka
「Shouldn't we store the cardboard in a different location from now on? A hurricane might be predictable, but we never know when we might get hit by a surprise rainstorm.」


％Ｂ
「That's true... I wonder if there's anywhere good...」
all
Touko
「Oh, there's a big metal locker inside the storage room over there. I think the cardboard could probably even survive the building collapsing if we put it in there.」


％Ｂ
「Oh, now that's the owner of the building for you. You know your stuff.」
Touko
「Ahaha, guess I do.」
％Ｂ
「All right, let's move the cardboard into there once it's dried.」
all
Misa
「I will go look at the fish tanks, then.」
％Ｂ
「Speaking of which, was the aquarium fine during the storm?」
Misa
「Yes, it appears there was no damage. I had been worried that the pumps may stop in the event of a power outage, but they were working without issue this morning when I came to check.」


Marika
「I'll go with Okihara-san, then.」
Natsuki
「I think I'll go watch the fish and relax too. It's not like we can do anything until the cardboard's dry anyway.」

all
Touko
「I'm hungry, so I'm going to go get something to eat. Anyone wanna come with?」

Rikka
「Now that I think about it, I haven't eaten breakfast, so I'm hungry too.」
％Ｂ
「I'll go buy some food for everyone, then.」
Touko
「Oh, there we go! Thank you for the meal!」
％Ｂ
「That doesn't mean it's my treat, all right? You better pay me back.」
Touko
「Whaaaat? Tch.」
all
％Ｂ
「Anyone got anything they wanna eat?」
Natsuki
「Pizza!」

Shuuichi
「Gyudon.」
all
Marika
「Pancakes or something...?」
Misa
「I would like sandwiches!」
Rikka
「I'm fine with anything.」
all
Touko
「Nothing like having steak in the morning!」
％Ｂ
「At least try to fit in.」
all
Sora
「Hamburger.」
Of course she would say that.
Natsuki
「Y'know, hamburgers don't sound too bad.」
all
Marika
「Yeah, I'd be down for that.」
Misa
「I think that sounds splendid.」
all
Rikka
「I'm fine with that as well.」
Touko
「Well if everyone else wants burgers, I'd feel weird getting something else. Might as well join in too.」

all
Shuuichi
「If we want burgers, McRonalds does delivery.」
％Ｂ
「Can we get it delivered to the school?」
Shuuichi
「I'm sure we can have them drop it off at the school gates.」
％Ｂ
「True, I'm sure that'll work.」
Shuuichi
「I'll order with my phone, so everyone tell me your orders.」
％Ｂ
「Thanks man.」
all
And so, everyone one by one tells Shuuichi their order. 
Sora
「Burgers can be delivered!」
In the midst of everything, Sora's excitment over the delivery service doesn't escape my attention.
Thaks to this, Sora might have received forbidden knowledge.

all
Shuuichi
「It's here.」
Shuuichi comes back to the classroom with one paper bag in each hand, as we're looking at the fish tank.

all
He gives me a bag to help pass out the food.
％Ｂ
「So who ordered the teriyaki burger?」
Touko
「Ah, that's my burger!」
％Ｂ
「And the cheesburger?」
all
Marika
「That's probably me!」
％Ｂ
「I assume the fish burger is yours, Senpai?」
all
Misa
「Yes, teehee.」
％Ｂ
「And the regular burger would be Sora's.」
all
Sora
「Umhm」
all
We start digging in, surrounded by the calming and peaceful fisk tanks. 
Touko
「You know, eating here isn't bad at all.」
Shuuichi
「The location's pretty decent too.」
Marika
「And the burgers are yummy as usual!」
When the cardboard got wet, we were all so worried, but now everyone is relieved that the issue is resolved.


all
Sora
「Mm!」
Sora freezes completely.
％Ｂ
「What's wrong?」
Sora
「...」
She gives me pouting eyes.
％Ｂ
「Ah, it must be pickles?」
Natsuki
「Oh, you don't like pickles, Sora?」
Shuuichi
「Sorry, I forgot to ask ahead of time.」
Sora
「Mmnh...」
Like always, Sora is holding her half eaten burger in front of me.
Sticking out from the end is pickle with a small nibble on it.
％Ｂ
「Alrighty.」
I bring myself closer to the burger and extract the pickle with my teeth.
It makes a satisfying crunching sound in my mouth.

Sora
「Thanks.」
Sora gives me an elated smile as everyone else is rendered speechless.
all
％Ｂ
「Ngh, Agh... Hmm, what's wrong everyone?」
Natsuki
「Y'know, is it just me or is just really hot in here? There's no AC in here at all, maybe that's why it's just so hot.」


Misa
「How charming, teehee.」
all
Marika
「That's bold of you, Ousaka.」
Rikka
「Do you have any shame?」
Touko
「That looked extremely naturally. I mean, do you always do this? You have done it before, right?」

Shuuichi
「Haha, you know, I do stuff like this all the time.」

％Ｂ
「Huh?」
Shit...
I did what I usually do, but now everyone else is a witness.
all
Natsuki
「Hah, it's just boiling in here.」
％Ｂ
「Argh...」
all
Damn, this is embarrassing.
Of course I'm blushing right now.
What about Sora?
all
Sora
「...」
Her face is dyed a deep crimson too.
all
Sora
「...」
After our meal, Sora is staring intently at the jellyfish tank.
Misa
「Do you happen to like jellyfish, Sora?」
Sora
「Umhm」
Sora
「There are jellyfish in space too.」
％Ｂ
「Huh, wait what? There's jellyfish in space?」
Sora
「There is.」
Misa
「Are you perhaps referring to martians?」
Sora
「There are no reports of martian lifeforms. However, the possibility is high.」
％Ｂ
「So what's with the jellyfish in space?」
Sora
「Below the Gemini constellation, there's a jellyfish galaxy from a supernova remnant.」
％Ｂ
「Huh, so that's a thing?」
Misa
「I definitely have to take a look at that!」
Ah, seems like Senpai's been reeled in too.
Sora
「Unfortunately, you can't see it with the naked eye. A telescope doesn't help much either.」
Misa
「Oh, that's too bad then.」
It's clear that Misa is sulking.
She wants to see it that bad?
Sora
「I'll bring a photo next time.」
Misa
「Are you sure? Thank you so much, Sora!」
Now that she's in high spirits, Senpai pulls Sora in for a hug.
Sora
「Muguh...」
Misa
「I'll be looking forward to that!」
Sora
「Uhh... Umhm」
all
After bringing the dried cardboard to the storage locker, we decide to head home.
We all walk in groups to the bus stop.
％Ｂ
「It really is so much fun hanging out with everyone.」
I start talking to Sora as stagger away form everyone else.

Sora
「Umhm」
Sora
「It's all because of
Ryou
you
.」
％Ｂ
「Me?」
Sora
「
Ryou was
You were
the one who reached out to everyone. And that includes me.」
％Ｂ
「Come on, I don't have that kind of power. If anything, it's the will of the stars that did this.」

Sora
「Stars?」
％Ｂ
「The first night we met, you were looking at the stars. I became curious, which is why I decided to approach you.」

Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「And when we met again, it was because of the stars. When I saw that star shaped paper fall from the roof, it led me back to you. That piece of paper had a wish written on it.」


Sora
「Umhm」
％Ｂ
「And whenever you were talking about the stars, you were just so cute. You were just so full of energy whenever you talked about that stars that I became mesmerized.」


Sora
「
Ryou
Ah
...」
％Ｂ
「When I confessed and when you accepted my feelings, the stars were glitteirng in the night skies above us. The stars were always watching us.」


％Ｂ
「And recently too, we got closer to everyone else because of your telescope. They were able to see the stars and feel their charm too.」


％Ｂ
「That's why it's all thanks to the stars.」
Sora
「Because of the stars...」
％Ｂ
「It's because of the stars that we were able to meet.」
Sora
「Umhm」
We both look at each other and smile.
Natsuki
「What are you two grinning at each other for? The bus is coming, you know.」
％Ｂ
「Ah, let's go.」
％Ｂ
「Come on, Sora.」
Sora
「Umhm」
