And so, before long...
We head to the OB-GYN department for an inspection.
However, it's not a quick and easy one.
Even after inspecting, they check on her time and time again before we get the results...
Marika
「They gave me their congratulations～」
Marika gently pats her stomach as she gives me an elated smile.
Marika
「When the hospital congratulated me, it felt a little weird.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「I mean, it's usually a place to go when you're ill.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Pregnancy isn't an illness though.」
Marika
「You're right... Haha...」
Marika
「It's something that natural and happy... yeah?」
Like she was doing before, I give her stomach a loving stroke.
Albeit, it's not standing out that much yet.
I mean, she's still in her first trimester.
But...
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Our baby's heart... is definitely beating.」
Marika
「Yeah, that makes me so happy～!」
We were able to see the results of the ultrasound.
The image I saw is now vividly seared into my brain.
Marika
「Our baby... is so tiny.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Yeah, it's only about 4cm.」
Marika
「But its heart... is steadily beating.」
Marika
「Even though it's so small... it's doing its best to live. Our baby will do its best and grow to be big and healthy.」

％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Yeah...」
If I have to be honest, it still hasn't sunk in at 
all that Marika is pregnant, though maybe it's because it hasn't been confirmed until now. 
But facing the truth with the ultrasound image was when reality struck me.
She's definitely carrying new life now.
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「I feel so happy too.」
From within, I feel so much bliss and love bubble forth.
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「It's like I could cry right now...」
Marika
「Your eyes are a bit moist.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Tch... You can really notice?」
Marika
「Of course I can～ Your eyes are bright red.」
Marika
「Besides... I feel the same way.」

Marika
「I could feel myself tearing up when I saw the ultrasound.」
Marika
「I'm so happy～...」
Our emotions begin to well up again, as her eyes moisten.
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「If we start crying now, what will we do when our baby is born?」

Marika
「I know～ Ahaha... We might be wailing...」
We both laugh.
We'll both be looking forward to that time.
Marika
「I already received a maternity health handbook.」
On the desk is the Shionagi maternity health handbook.
There's also a keychain badge Marika can wear telling others she's pregnant.
Marika
「I'll make sure to diligently fill this out.」
As soon as Marika gets home, she starts recording
the ultrasound information.
She's writing short and compact sentences, but her emotions are pertinent throughout.

Marika
「When our baby is born, I want to save this behind.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「It'll be like a memoir.」
Marika
「Yeah, exactly.」
Marika
「You know, I saw my mom's materniy health handbook a little while earlier.」

％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「So that's from when you were born?」
Marika
「Yeah, she made sure to hold onto it.」
Marika
「She said it might be handy, so she gave it to me to look.」
Marika
「It was my first time seeing it though.」
Marika
「When she was pregnant, she recorded her feelings, her morning sickness pains, her bleeding problems... she made sure to track it all.」


Marika
「That made me so happy.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「So you were able to see how your mom actually felt.」
Marika
「Yeah, she did so much to give birth to me.」
Marika
「That's what got me thinking.」
Marika
「So now, I'll make sure to thoroughly fill out my maternity health handbook too.」

Marika
「Whenever our baby grows up, I want to to show them this.」

％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「I see...」
She inherited those thoughts and feelings from her mother. 
I guess that's what it means to be a parent.
I have to do better in cherishing Marika and our baby more and more.
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Are you still feeling fine?」
I gently hug her from behind.
Marika
「Yeah... Ehehehe...」
Marika
「I'm still okay～ You don't need to worry...」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「But don't you feel a little warm?」
Marika
「Oh, yeah. My body temperature might be up a bit.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Are you sure you're fine?」
Marika
「I have been feeling a bit sluggish...」
Marika
「And afterwards, I feel really tired sometimes.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「That doesn't sound like you're okay. If you need any help, don't be afraid to ask for it.」

Marika
「T-thanks～」
Marika
「I don't think I need any yet, but... My morning sickness might worsen from now on.」

％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「It makes you want to wet something sour, right?」
Marika
「Yeah, citrus fruits are good, like grapefruits.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Got it. I'll go buy some beans and peel them.」
Marika
「Wow～ Thanks a bunch～」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Well, I've also heard it can make you sick afterwards...」
Marika
「I heard it can make you sensitive to odours and make you feel naeseous.」
Marika
「I heard mixing those odours with steam is espeicaly bad... like with a hot meal or a hot bath.」

％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Okay then... I guess I'll be cooking dinner from now on.」

％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「We'll probably have to keep the bath lukewarm. We might have to get a fan running in there.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Also, we have to consier cigarette smoke when we go out, so if that happens, then...」
I don't smoke, but if I meet people in the coffee 
shop who do, I'm not sure how I'll avoid that.
And that's not even aking into account the bar too...
Marika
「Ahaha, you're thinking too much.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Y-you think?」
Marika
「I'm still fine.」
Marika
「But I'm glad you're looking out for me like this.」
Marika
「Thanks...」
She gently surrenders her body to me.
As a guy, there's nothing that I'm able to do, as Marika is one carrying and giving birth to our child.
That's why I'll do whatever I can to help her.
Before long, the seasons change.
Autumn comes to a close and winter arrives.
The year changes and the signs of spring are right around the corner.
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Good job on everything.」
Marika
「Yeah... Thanks.」
Marika
「You know... time just really flew by～...」
As of this March, Marika has officially resigned from her post at the nursery.
The kids she was taking care are now starting elementary school, so that's good timing at least.

％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Did Mrs. Marika receive any graduation celebrations?」
Marika
「I did～!」
Marika
「The kids and the other teachers threw a surprise celebration.」
Marika
「They gave it their all dancing. It was so cute～ And I start bawling a lot when they gave me the paper bouquet.」


％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Ahaha, your eyes were red in the picture.」
They took a commemerative picure together.
The print is now carefully stored in an album.
The kids and teachers are surrounding Marika, who's holding her paper bouquet.
Her cheeks are blotted in tears as she's giving a heartfelt smile.
Marika
「It was a great workplace. I wish I could have worked longer...」

％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「I mean, once our child is old enough, you can return there part time, yeah? That's what they said.」

Marika
「Yeah... I'm grateful.」
She had the choice of taking a leave of absence, 
but because it was our first child, that made her worry a bit.
And so, she decided to retire for now  and we'll reassess the situation in the future. 

Marika
「The people there are amazing. They're letting me take as much time as I want and letting me come back if I want.」

％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「I mean, it takes a lot to learn how to raise our kid.」
Marika
「Definitely, I'm even studying up now.」
Marika
「There are times when I worry... But right now, I'll face childbirth head on. That's the most important thing.」


She smiles and sticks out her chest.
There were times in the first trimester where Marika felt down or anxious.
But now, she seems bright and cheerful.

Marika
「Now that I'm entering the second trimester, it's not just my body, but my heart is feeling more stable.」
With that, she begins patting her stomach.
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「I see... That's good then.」
Marika
「I've become so big. Looks like I have no chocie but to become a mom～」

Her stomach really has become really big.
She gives me a smile, as she's wearing a comfy and loose one piece dress.
Marika
「Thank you, Ryousuke...」
Marika
「Thnak you...」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Huh? I didn't do anything.」
Marika
「No, you gave me tons of support.」
Marika
「Like you did a lot of the chores～」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Well, it's only fair that I help out.」
Of course, with her morning sickness, it's hard on her to go to work.
And when she comes back, she's completely 
exhausted.
It's the least I can do to help out with the chores.
Marika
「I'm feeling fine now, so from here on out, I'll keep doing my best.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Alright, sure thing. But don't overdo it, got that?」

Marika
「Ahaha～ I'll be fine.」
Marika
「...」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Huh?」
Marika
「Umm...」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「W-what's wrong?」
Marika
「S-sorry, can you hold on...?」
Marika is frozen in place.
She seems shocked, but what is it exactly?
Marika
「A-ah～!」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「W-what?」
Marika
「I felt movement...」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Huh?」
Marika
「Our baby is moving in my stomach～」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Really?」
Marika
「Yeah, right here! You can feel it here!」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「So, umm...?」
I place my hand where Marika is pointing.
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「I don't feel anything...」
Marika
「Ah～ Seems like it's stopped moving...」
Marika
「But I definitely felt a kick!」
Marika
「Can you give me another one～ Please～...」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Please? Papa is asking you too...」
Marika
「Papa is here now. Can you please give us another kick?」

％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「...」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「There's still nothing.」
Marika
「Maybe it didn't hear us?」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Oh well, you can't win them all. I'm sure there will be mov-」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「...」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Huh...?」
Marika
「A-Ah!」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「That was...」
I feel a really tiny vibration.
But it definitely came from Marika's stomach.
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「It moved...」
Marika
「I-it did...」
Marika
「Our baby kicked.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Y-yeah! That was definitely a kick!」
Marika
「Wow～ It understood Papa～…」
Marika
「You're such a good kid～ You're so well-behaved...」
Seemingly content, Marika gently pats her stomach.
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「...」
My finger is slightly trembling.
I definitely felt a spark of life.
That sensation travelled up my finger to my heart. That's when reality hit me.
Before long, I'll become a father...
Seems like Marika is already aware that she'll be a mother.
I feel those emotions starting to sprout within me.
﻿Time passed in the blink of an eye after that.
％Ｂ
「Yes, if you could do as circumstances demand for that. I'll be stopping by in a bit, so we can speak again then.」

％Ｂ
「Oh no, thank you very much for everything. It's only a bit more to go, so let's do our best together until the end.」

I hang up.
Azuma
「Was that about the Oono residence?」
％Ｂ
「Yes. There was apparently some trouble with the supplies, but it seems like it's something that could be handled on site. I'm going to go see how they're doing afterward, but I don't anticipate any issues.」


all
Firm Staff B
「You've really gotten dependable all of a sudden lately.」
％Ｂ
「I'll have been working here for five whole years soon, after all. And I'll be a father soon. I can't allow myself to be unreliable forever.」


Azuma
「You're already looking like a father, too.」
all
Firm Staff A
「How many months pregnant is your wife again?」
％Ｂ
「Seven months.」
Firm Staff B
「So she's in the stable period of the pregnancy?」
％Ｂ
「Yes, things have calmed down.」
Firm Staff A
「So it'll be born around summer? You'll need to work hard and make as much money as you can, then.」

Azuma
「You do your best to make something great. Being an architect's about making places for people to be. You're gonna tell your kid, "This place was made by your old man."」


％Ｂ
「...Yes!」
That day's still a bit further in the future, but I do want to make something that I can be proud of to my children.

％Ｂ
「I'll start by making sure everything goes smoothly with the Oono residence.」
Azuma
「Yeah. You're finally at the final stage.」
The Oono residence'll be done soon.
It's taken a bit longer than originally planned due to last-minute changes in the house plan, but it's really almost complete.

all
Firm Staff A
「I hear they're calling it the "house that holds light."」
That's what they're calling the Oono residence on site.
I don't know who started calling it that, but it's suddenly become natural to call it that.

％Ｂ
「The workers on site were apparently talking about how the house was always bright inside, no matter where you were. So that's apparently why it's called that.」


Azuma
「It'll be good to see it done soon, so we can see Oono-san happy.」
％Ｂ
「Yes, I'll do my best!」
all
I really do want Oono-san and his family members to start living there soon.\n\r

I hope that house can be a place that nurtures the Oonos' happiness.
And I want my child that's to be born soon to see 
not just that house, but also the Oonos living happily inside.
I want to be able to tell my child that this is what their father does as his job.
％Ｂ
「I'll head out to the work site, then!」
Firm Staff A
「He sure is motivated. We can't let ourselves lose either.」
Firm Staff B
「You're right～」
Azuma
「All right. How about we get fired up too?」
Marika
「So Oono-san's house is almost finished?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, finally. Oono-san says he wants me to bring you to come see it once it's finished too.」


Marika
「Mhm, I'm excited♪」
She lays a hand on her belly.
It's really big now.
Marika＿ＣＳ
「When our baby is born and everything is settled, let's all go take a look.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Yeah, the three of us.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「After all, it was the first house Papa worked on.」
Marika＿ＣＳ
「That's amazing～」
Marika＿ＣＳ
「Our baby will certainly be excited to see.」
After that, the rest of the day went by without any issues.
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Our baby really is growing a lot.」
Marika＿ＣＳ
「Definitely～」
Marika＿ＣＳ
「Lately, I've been getting dizzy if I don't eat a lot.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Huh, really?」
Marika＿ＣＳ
「Yeah, it's due to anemia because our baby is using a lot of nutrients to grow.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Interesting.」
Marika＿ＣＳ
「Mama will have to eat a lot. That way our baby can grow without worry.」
She speaks in a tender voice.
We then both gently rub her stomach.
Marika＿ＣＳ
「Oh... I felt another kick.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「I've been recognizing out baby more often.」
Even she first started moving, I had to really pay attention to notice it, and even then I missed it sometimes.
But nowadays, it's very distinct.
Marika＿ＣＳ
「Earlier, our baby was tossing and turning.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Moving that much, huh...」
Marika＿ＣＳ
「Babies really are incredible.」
Marika＿ＣＳ
「They have the same amount of cells as any adult.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Really...?」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「At the ultrasound the other day, I was able to make out the head.」
Marika＿ＣＳ
「I think the head looks like Papa's.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Really? I thought the head looked more like yours.」
Marika＿ＣＳ
「Our baby resembles the both of us.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「well, it our child.」
Marika＿ＣＳ
「Yeah...」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「We better start thinking of some names.」
Marika
「I've already been thinking about it a bit. My parents said they'll let us handle it.」

％Ｂ
「Really? I'm grateful, but that's a lot of responsibility.」
My parents apparently don't want to try to influence our decision much either.
Well, I had already seen that coming, since I know those two.
But I'm surprised that Marika's parents would say that too.
I guess that means they just trust us that much.
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「But we still don't know the gender...」
Marika＿ＣＳ
「The angle on the ultrasound was kinda bad...」
％Ｂ
「Then we should think of names for both boys and girls... Or maybe a name that could go either way.」


Marika
「U-Um.」
％Ｂ
「Hm?」
Marika
「I feel like... It's just a feeling, but... I think it's a girl.」

％Ｂ
「Huh? You can tell?」
Marika
「Aaahh～ I don't, but it's like I do～」
％Ｂ
「Doesn't that mean you do?」
Marika
「When I get a little sleepy... or when I've just woken up... I can just kind of imagine it being a girl.」

％Ｂ
「No way... That's amazing...」
Marika
「I won't know for sure until we check, of course～」
If she's right, then the body of a mother is to be feared...
％Ｂ
「Let's start by thinking of girls' names, then.」
Marika
「Okay, that sounds good～」
％Ｂ
「Let's see... Shuuichi's kid's named Kanon-chan, right?」
Marika
「She's so cute～ I called her Non-chan at our wedding.」

Marika
「I stuck out my finger, and she grabbed it. Her hands were so small～」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, you're right. That kid was cute... But our kid's gonna be even cuter. She'll grab your finger tight with both hands when you stick it out...」


Marika
「Hehehe... You're so biased.」
％Ｂ
「Speaking of, they apparently put the character for flower in her name 'cause it was the season for flowers.」

Marika
「Oh, really?」
％Ｂ
「She was born in May, and there's a park in front of their house... and the flower garden there was apparently really pretty. That's why she's named Kanon-chan.」


It was apparently Kaori-san's idea.
I guess she's still a literature club girl after all.
Marika
「Really～ So it's like my name, then. You know how my name has the same character in it?」

％Ｂ
「Yeah. I remember you were talking about it at our wedding.」
Marika
「I think that might've been the first time I mentioned it. There's a lot of things like that, aren't there?」

％Ｂ
「I guess being married doesn't mean you know everything about each other, huh.」
Marika
「Let's learn lots as we go. Together, with this child.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah. Let's do that.」
We smile at each other.
I feel like I can see a beautiful future ahead of us.
％Ｂ
「But... yeah, something like that'd be nice.」
Marika
「You mean the name, right? Yeah, how do I put it... It'd be nice if it could be a name that celebrates the fact that they were born.」


％Ｂ
「Well, she's supposed to be born in August, which is summer, so... Natsuko?」
Marika
「It's cute, but I'm not really sure about that one.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah... Natsumi? Sena? Hmm, I can't really think of a good one...」

％Ｂ
「Or maybe we shouldn't just focus on the "summer" thing. I feel like I just thought of something good...」

％Ｂ
「If we wanna celebrate them being born... Uhh... Like..」

Marika
「Oh, did you think of something?」
％Ｂ
「Just kind of a vague image... I'll show you some candidate names later.」

Marika
「Okay. I'll think of some too. Let's look them over and decide together.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, let's do that.」
We smile.
I wouldn't trade these moments for anything.
％Ｂ
「I wonder if our kid's listening in on our conversations too.」
Marika
「Yeah, our baby can hear our voices crystal clear.」
Marika
「I heard she's learning about the outside world bit by bit.」

％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Interesting.」
Marika
「It's morning right now... When it's night, Mama will walk and go to sleep.」

Marika
「She's sucking and hiccupping inside my stomach.」

％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Seems like she's practicing for when she enters the world.」
Marika
「You got that right.」
Marika
「I might be nervous for when I'll give birth...」
Marika
「But I'm confident that we'll grow close together.」

％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Yeah...」
Our baby isn't born yet, but she already has some semblance of consciousnes.
Coming out of the womb will definitely be a grand adventure for her.
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Alright, let's make sure to talk lots.」
I want to remove our anxieties together as a family.
As I'm in deep thought, I gently pat her stomach.
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Hey, Papa is here...」
I feel a light kick, or something of that ilk.
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Thank you for growing so much. Hopefully, I'll be able to meet you soon so that I can hug you.」

％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「But you don't need to rush, okay?」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Right now, you can just rely on Mama.」
Marika
「Aha... I felt another kick.」
Marika
「That's how she responds to Papa's voice.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「I hope you're happy.」
Marika
「She definitely seems like it.」
Marika
「If we're happy... then I'm sure she'll be happy as well.」

％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Yeah, you're right.」
Marika
「Ryousuke...」
Marika
「Kuh...」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「Chuu...」
Marika
「Ngh, Chuu...」
We share a light kiss.
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「I love you and our unborn child so much...」

Marika
「Thanks... Teehee...」
Marika
「I can feel... how strong your love is...」
Marika
「I love you so much too～ Ngh... Chuu...」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「I love you so much... Chu, Chuu...」
I caress her lips with my own many times over.
Marika
「Oh... our baby is moving again. 
I'm sure she wants to be a part of our lives even sooner.」
％Ｂ＿ＣＳ
「I'll definitely be looking forward to that day.」
Marika
「Yeah～...」
％Ｂ
「Thank you... for having my child.」
Marika
「Hauuuh～ ...I'm so happyyy...」

Her eyes look at me dreamily as she gently pets her belly.
She looks so happy.
Marika
「Mm, chu...」
％Ｂ
「Chu, slrp...」
Marika
「Mm, chu, kpf... Slrp... mlh...」
We kiss over and over again.
Marika
「Hauuuh... I love you... toooo... I'm so happy to have... your baby, Ryousuke...」

Marika
「Hauuuh... I love you... toooo... I'm so happy to have... your baby...」

％Ｂ
「Marika...」
Marika
「Aah, hnh...」
I gently stroke her boobs.
They've gotten bigger.
She said that they might even be E cups now.
％Ｂ
「Are we supposed to... stop doing it about now?」
Marika
「Oh...! It-It is still okay～」
Marika
「My belly's gotten big, and I'm getting toward the end of the pregnancy, so we'll have to stop soon... but it should just barely still be okay now...」


Marika
「I won't be able... to have you show me lots of love for a while, so...」

％Ｂ
「Then... want me to go take a shower real quick? It's probably best for me to be as clean as possible, for the baby's sake...」

Marika
「...Okay.」
She pushes herself against me even more, pouting cutely.

％Ｂ
「I love you, Marika...」
Marika
「Mhm... I love you so much.」
We kiss passionately again...
