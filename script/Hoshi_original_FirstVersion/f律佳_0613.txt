―I just don't understand.
Why is he so concerned about me?
It's just a waste of time talking to a girl this boring...
I'm more at ease, more relaxed when I'm alone...
Rikka
「...」
I look up at the sky through the window from my seat.
The clouds move on steadily, just like always.
But recently, I've been...
There's been a distinctly different emotion inside me recently...
I've never felt this before. I don't understand what it is.

All I know is that without even realizing, I've been watching him.
It's probably because he's the first person I've met in a long time that actually tries to interact with me.

Segawa-san was the only other person who ever really did that before him.
There were a few people who tried to invite me to do things with them back toward the beginning of my first year...

But that stopped altogether after I kept declining.
I put up walls around myself, because both of my parents are celebrated musicians.

And everyone avoids me because of that.
And I welcome being avoided.
That was good enough for me.
It was my world... A world for just me alone.
A world where I don't have to associate with anyone. A world that's complete with just me.
A world of my own fabrication.
And then someone strange barged in.
I thought he was irritating, but now he's just melting into my world, as if it were only natural...
...Maybe that's why.
all
Back then...
Maybe that's why I didn't say no right away when he asked me that, and replied with "Why?" instead.

％Ｂ
「Oh? She's not here.」
_00cutinBS
I pass by the second music classroom while doing committee work, and no one's inside.
％Ｂ
「...I wonder where Narusawa is today.」
She's been playing piano here after school every day since I transferred in. This is a first.

But when I think about it, it's not like she's in a club or anything, so she doesn't actually have any need to be here.

_00cutinBS
％Ｂ
「Maybe she had something else to do.」
It feels kinda sad to find out that something you had been taking for granted's suddenly gone.
Shuuichi
「Good work.」
％Ｂ
「Good work.」
Natsuki
「Gooood work!」
Marika
「Good work, everyone.」
all
Shuuichi locks the committee room door, bringing today's committee work to a close.
Marika
「Um... Want to go home together?」
％Ｂ
「Could you wait a bit? I'm gonna go to the bathroom.」
Marika
「Okay. I'll be waiting at the entranceway, then.」
％Ｂ
「Thanks.」
I take off to the bathroom at a bit of a run.
I hurry toward the entranceway to meet up with Shinozaki after finishing my business.
Wonder if the humanities clubs have gone home already.
All is quiet in the school building.
The setting sun casts long shadows in the hallway.
％Ｂ
「She said the entranceway, right? I should hurry. Wouldn't wanna make her wait.」

I pick up my pace.
％Ｂ
「...Narusawa?」
I spot her silky black hair at the far end of the hallway that I had expected to be deserted.

Narusawa's walking along the hall, her gaze turned downward. She looks worried.

It looks like she's searching for something.
％Ｂ
「Narusawa. You drop something?」
Rikka
「
...Hino-kun. 

Uh, mh...」
Rikka
「Don't worry about it. It doesn't have anything to do with you.」
％Ｂ
「I'm the kinda guy who just gets more curious when people say things like that.」
％Ｂ
「I'll help. It'll be easier to find with two people, right?」
I feel bad that I made Shinozaki wait for me, but I'll let her know that she can leave without me.

Rikka
「There's no reason for you to help me.」
％Ｂ
「There's no way I could just not help a friend who's in need... That not good enough for you?」

Rikka
「...I don't remember us ever becoming friends.」
％Ｂ
「Let's say we're friends starting now, then. So what'd you lose?」
Rikka
「You just love butting into other people's business, don't you?」
％Ｂ
「Hahaha, I get that a lot.」
Rikka
「...It's sheet music. For "A Fragment of Emotion."」
％Ｂ
「You mean the same sheet music from yesterday?」
Rikka
「Yes. I remember I brought it to school, but I realized at some point that it was gone...」

Rikka
「I've looked everywhere I could think of, but it's nowhere to be found.」
％Ｂ
「Sheet music's pretty big, so I feel like someone probably would've turned it in to the lost and found if they found it.」

Rikka
「I went to the faculty office too. But they told me no one brought anything like that in.」
％Ｂ
「Hmm～ ...Well, let's step back, look at the situation, and think over things again.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, you mind if I make a quick call before that? Shinozaki's waiting for me.」

Rikka
「You should go home with her, then.」
％Ｂ
「It's fine. Today you, tomorrow me.」
Rikka
「...Thank you.」
all
I nod in response to her thanks, and pull up Shinozaki on my phone.

I pause to think as I move to tap her number.
It's Shinozaki, so she'd probably wanna help too once I told her why I'm staying.
Maybe I should just ask her to help too.
Having more people is always better when you're looking for something.
And Shuuchi and Segawa might still be around too.
As expected, Shinozaki readily agreed to help after I explained things.
Shuuichi and Segawa were also apparently still at school, and they showed up right away after hearing about the situation.

Shuuichi
「―I see. I've got the general idea now.」
According to Narusawa:
1. She confirmed the sheet music was in her bag this\n   morning.
2. She took it to the music room with her during lunch\n   break.
3. She put it in her desk after lunch break.
4. She realized the sheet music was gone when she checked\n   her bag after school in the music room. She checked her\n   desk afterward, but it wasn't there.
％Ｂ
「So that means there's a good chance you lost the sheet music on the way from our classroom to the music room...」

all
Rikka
「I searched the halls between the rooms, of course. But I didn't find it.」
Natsuki
「Maybe someone took it home with them?」
％Ｂ
「We can't strike out the possibility, but let's all split up and look for it first. We can consider that afterward.」

Marika
「That's true. I'm pretty good at finding things people have lost, you know.」

Natsuki
「Then Marika and I'll try walking the path from our classroom to the music classroom. There might be something you missed.」

Shuuichi
「I think I'll take a look at the music classroom. It's not too big, so I'll be fine on my own.」

％Ｂ
「Got it. Then Narusawa and I'll go through any other places we can think of one by one.」

％Ｂ
「All right everyone, I'm counting on you.」
Rikka
「Thank you... very much.」
Marika
「Mhm. I'll do my best.」
Natsuki
「All right! Let's do this!」
Everyone heads toward their designated locations.
％Ｂ
「All right, we should get looking too.」
％Ｂ
「...Narusawa?」
She's staring intently at Shinozaki and the others as they walk away.

She seems somewhat confused, or maybe hesitant.
As if she just couldn't understand why they would help her...

No, maybe it's more like... she understands it logically, but doesn't emotionally.

％Ｂ
「Let's go, Narusawa.」
Rikka
「Oh... Yes.」
％Ｂ
「...Wonder where it's gotten to.」
We've looked everywhere that seemed logically plausible, but we haven't found the sheet music.

Shinozaki and the others haven't contacted us, which probably means they haven't found it either.

If we haven't found it after this much effort, then maybe it's like Segawa said, and someone really took it home with them.
But why?
Sheet music isn't particularly valuable to most people.
I know that personally, if I found sheet music, I'd turn it in right away.
But the people at the faculty office said they didn't have anything like that.
％Ｂ
「...」
...But would I really turn it in to the faculty office?
If I had found it in a hallway that sees lots of traffic, then it'd be difficult to figure out whose it was if I didn't actually see them drop it a few seconds prior.

But what if I found it somewhere where I could more or less guess at whose it was?

I wouldn't have to spend time and effort on a catch-all option like turning it in to the faculty office in that case.

％Ｂ
「Narusawa. You know for sure you put the sheet music in your desk, right?」

Rikka
「I do. But it wasn't there.」
I know that's true, because I checked there myself too.
But what I wanted to know with that question is "where she saw it last."
all
I start digging through one of the desks next to Narusawa's.
Rikka
「Wha...? Why are you looking through someone else's desk without permission?」
％Ｂ
「It's fine, don't worry. We'll see how this goes. Excuuuse me, and...」
％Ｂ
「No dice here. Next.」
Narusawa watches me quizzically as I ransack another desk.
％Ｂ
「If I'm thinking along the right lines... Hmm～ I don't see it here either.」

all
Not this one either.
Lastly, my desk.
I stick my hand in and―
％Ｂ
「...Hm?」
I can immediately tell there's something unfamiliar in my desk.
％Ｂ
「Oh... It's a big, pretty-looking book...!」
％Ｂ
「Narusawa! This is the sheet music, right!?」
Rikka
「Oh...」
I see a definite tinge of relief in her shocked expression.
And then... she gives a small nod.
Rikka
「But... why is it in your desk?」
％Ｂ
「I think it must've fallen out when you were moving things into your bag, or someone bumped into it or something, and it fell onto the floor.」


％Ｂ
「And someone nearby picked it up.」
％Ｂ
「And they just put it back into the closest desk, which was mine, without looking at what the contents were.」

％Ｂ
「I remember something like this happened to me once back in grade school.」
％Ｂ
「Either way, it's good that we found it, huh?」
Rikka
「Yes... Thank you!」
She smiles gently as I hand her the sheet music.
She holds the case tight. Her eyes look a little damp.
I can tell that sheet music must be really important to her.
She must not have been playing piano in the music room today because she was looking for this.

This whole time after school, as soon as she realized it was missing...
I'm so glad we found it.
A smile naturally forms on my face as I watch her.

Rikka
「Why do you look so happy?」
％Ｂ
「Well, that's something important to you, right?」
％Ｂ
「Then of course I'm happy you found it.」
Rikka
「Oh...」
％Ｂ
「Oh, gotta tell the others we found it.」
all
I grab my phone to let everyone else know.
They all respond with their own versions of "That's great."
Narusawa types her thanks into the chat as well.
Rikka
「And thank you so much.」
She looks right into my eyes.
Rikka
「Because this... is very important to me.」
％Ｂ
「Really. That makes me all the more glad we found it, then.」
Rikka
「Could you let me do something to thank you somehow?」
％Ｂ
「It's not like I did it 'cause I wanted something in return, and I bet it's the same for everyone else too.」

Rikka
「But it wouldn't sit right with me otherwise.」
％Ｂ
「Hmm～ But it's not like I really... Oh!」
Something comes to mind. I guess I'll let her do something for me, then.
％Ｂ
「Anything's fine?」
Rikka
「What? Yes. If it's something I'm able to do.」
％Ｂ
「Then could you think over the event committee thing one more time?」

％Ｂ
「I want you to really consider it, instead of just never having an answer for me.」
Rikka
「...Why "think"?」
％Ｂ
「What?」
Rikka
「I said I'd do anything. You could have told me to just join instead of thinking about it.」

％Ｂ
「I don't wanna force you. I want you to join because you want to.」
％Ｂ
「It's like I told you before. I'm just poking my head into something that isn't my business by wanting to see you have fun more.」

Rikka
「...」
％Ｂ
「Shinozaki's a bit shy like you'd expect, but she's really nice.」

％Ｂ
「Shuuichi and Segawa mess around a lot, but you saw how they were really trying to help you find the sheet music.」

％Ｂ
「They're all good people.」
Rikka
「Same for you. It's impressive how soft-hearted you are. I've never met anyone this dogged about getting me to do something with them.」

％Ｂ
「I wouldn't do this to just anyone, you know.」
Rikka
「Wha...?」
％Ｂ
「I'm doing it 'cause I think things'll be more fun if you joined. For both you and me.」

％Ｂ
「How about you make some more nice memories with us? Like we did when we all went camping.」

Rikka
「...」
％Ｂ
「Wasn't it... fun for you when we went camping?」
She closes her eyes, as if to remember.
A single, small nod.
Rikka
「...You're right. It was fun... Really fun.」
％Ｂ
「Well that's that then, isn't it?」
Rikka
「Hehe... You really are forceful.」
I smile at her happily, and she responds in kind.
