―Autumn this year was astonishingly pleasant and comfortable.
October... Today is the day before the day of Rikka and Meguru-chan's promise.
Meguru
「Onee-chaaaan!」
Meguru-chan leaps onto Rikka, just like she always does.
Rikka
「Welcome home.」
Meguru
「Mhm, I'm hooome～」
Meguru
「It's nice to see you again too, Nii-san. Eheh, you've become my real brother-in-law now.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, long time no see. Haha, it's all thanks to your advice.」
Meguru
「Onee-chan, Nii-san. Congratulations on getting married!」
％Ｂ & Rikka
「Thank you.」
Meguru
「Hehehe, you're perfectly in step. You're so in love.」
Rikka
「Mhm. We are husband and wife, you know.」
Meguru
「My teasing won't work on Onee-chan now that she's a married woman...!」
She seems shocked.
Rikka
「Wh-What are you saying? Married woman? Uuuh... Don't say it in such a weird way.」
Meguru
「Oh. She's the same as usual.」
％Ｂ
「Hahaha, there's no way she'd change all of a sudden just 'cause she got married.」
Meguru
「You're right. I don't know what I'd do if Onee-chan suddenly became full of mature sex appeal.」
Rikka
「Geez... That won't happen.」
％Ｂ
「You're going to be staying over at our place tonight, right?」
Meguru
「I was planning on it, but I was wondering if I was going to be bothering your newlywed life that way.」

Rikka
「You don't need to worry about that.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, and it's not like our life together started only now just 'cause we're newlyweds...」
Rikka
「Oh...」
all
Rikka suddenly blanches.
Then her face goes red before our very eyes.
％Ｂ
「What's wrong?」
Rikka
「Um... There are condoms left out next to our bed...」
She whispers into my ear so only I can hear.
％Ｂ
「Oh yeah, you're right...」
Rikka
「And she might find my dirty underwear and the adult toys too... I wonder if we could hide them somewhere so they're harder to find...」

The longer we live together, the more things we have that we can't let other people see...
％Ｂ
「Rikka. Buy us some time.」
Rikka
「Okay.」
all
％Ｂ
「Meguru-chan, I've just remembered I had something to do, so I'll be heading back first.」
Meguru
「Oh, is that so? Then I'll come with...」

Rikka
「M-Meguru! I want to go shopping, so could you come with me?」
Meguru
「Wha, shopping? Okay...???」
Meguru-chan tilts her head in confusion at our suddenly different behavior.
％Ｂ
「All right, Meguru-chan. Sorry, but could you help Rikka with her shopping? Oh, here, I'll take your bags. I'll bring them with me.」
Meguru
「I understand. Thank you very much.」
all
Meguru-chan hands me her bags, and as we pass each other...
Rikka
「...」
％Ｂ
「...」
Rikka and I exchange a look.
A wink.
"Let's have Meguru-chan come over in an hour."
Having visitors who could potentially see the state of your private quarters is bad for your heart.
％Ｂ
「Phew... This should be good.」
I've hidden every single object that we might not want Meguru-chan to see in difficult-to-find places.
Well, I guess this means that Rikka and I just have that many secrets just between the two of us...
This must just be the cost of happiness. I'll choose to believe that, at least.
―The next day.
Rikka and Meguru-chan are happily playing atop the stage.
They're like children having fun together.
Sayaka
「"A Fragment of Emotion" is a piece I wrote with memories from when we went to the Tanabata Festival together with Rikka and Meguru in mind.」

It's currently intermission.
My mother-in-law came back to Japan for today just to listen to Rikka and Meguru-chan's performance. She's gazing nostalgically at the stage as she speaks.
Sayaka
「We were only able to go just once as a family because we were busy with work, but it was fun.」
Sayaka
「Rikka and Meguru ran around so much they both ruined the fit of their yukata... I remember how they put tanzaku on the decorations and wished with all their hearts.」
Sayaka
「So I made a wish too.」
Sayaka
「For the two of them to always be close, as they come together while pursuing their dreams.」
％Ｂ
「So your wish has finally come true.」
Sayaka
「It has. This might be the true form of "A Fragment of Emotion."」
Sayaka
「Fufu, the Shionagi Tanabata Festival organization committee that asked me to compose this would be angry with me for saying that. Keep that part a secret, okay?」
％Ｂ
「I will.」
Sayaka
「By the way... Do you plan on having children?」
％Ｂ
「Chi...!?」
I come this close to yelling, but I hastily shut my mouth after remembering I'm currently in a concert hall.
Sayaka
「I talk with Rikka over the phone every now and then, but she's always too embarrassed to tell me. So I was wondering.」
％Ｂ
「Uhh～ Um... It's in the future, for now, I think.」
Sayaka
「Is that so? So you do have plans, then... Fufu.」
％Ｂ
「Why do you seem so happy about that?」
Sayaka
「Wouldn't you be sad as a parent if you were told your child didn't want children of their own?」

Sayaka
「We weren't able to interact much with Rikka because we had our hands full with Meguru... so I was worried that Rikka might have associated bad things with the idea of parenthood.」
％Ｂ
「But you already talked things over with Rikka back when we asked for permission to live together.」
Sayaka
「Forgiving someone and becoming a parent are two different things.」
％Ｂ
「...」
Sayaka
「Once you become a parent, you have an obligation to watch over your child until they can stand on their own two legs. I wasn't able to do that, and forced her to become too much of an adult...」
Sayaka
「It's still my responsibility, even if she doesn't begrudge me for it.」

％Ｂ
「Yes, Rikka used to cry a lot when she was happy. I think it might've been a way for her to cope with sadness.」

％Ｂ
「But if she wants to have a child, then don't you think it means she's willing to accept those obligations?」
％Ｂ
「It's not the past that's important, but the present... and the future. I'm going to keep on making Rikka happy from now on.」

％Ｂ
「I'll treasure the daughter that you gave birth to with my own hands, for the rest of my life. So...」
％Ｂ
「When we do have a child, please be there to hold them.」
Sayaka
「Ryousuke-kun... Yes. I'd love to.」
Sayaka
「...Yes. I'd love to.」
That night...
The emotions of two overlapped to form one melody.
