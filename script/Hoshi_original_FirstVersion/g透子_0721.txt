Touko
「...Morning.」
...She's in a terrible mood.
I think I can guess at what happened.
This... seems to be implying it didn't work out well...
％Ｂ
「M-Morning. So you managed to get here at the usual time.」
Touko
「...Guess I did.」
％Ｂ
「Uh... I-I'm looking forward to lunch! I think I'll enjoy pretty much anything if it's something you made!」


Touko
「..."Pretty much" anything. Yeah, you wouldn't like anything, right...?」
...What's with that tortured-looking smile!?
all
％Ｂ
「Thank you very much, then... Please bring the paperwork to the event committee office by the end of the day.」

...I'm exhausted.
I feel like I've already used up a day's worth of energy, and it isn't even lunchtime yet.

Up to the fourth floor to hand out paperwork, then down to the first floor to collect paperwork.
Up to the third floor to answer a question, then right back to the first floor to help.
I've been running up and down the stairs like that all morning.
％Ｂ
「It's so hot... I'm starving... I feel like it was better back when I was just taking classes...」

To be honest, I had underestimated how much work this would all be.
...This is gonna go on for more than two more weeks?
％Ｂ
「Oh, what is it now...?」
It makes me wanna scream, "I can only be in one place at a time!"
I think I can understand a bit of why businesspeople would want to turn their phones off.

【Touko】「It's almost lunch.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, it's Touko.」
【Touko】「Come back to the old #Nschool building.」
【Touko】_st_0305
【％Ｂ】「Hungry?」
【％Ｂ】「I'll be right back. I'm #Nstarving too.」
Looks like I'll finally get to take a break.
I think I'll take an hour off for my lunch break...
％Ｂ
「Sigh... I'm back.」
Touko
「Welcome baaack. Good job doing all that today.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, I'm exhausted... Freaking Shuuichi pushing all this work onto me...!」

I haven't gone up and down the stairs that much since back when I used to play soccer.
I hope my legs aren't gonna hurt tomorrow morning...
％Ｂ
「So I didn't get to ask this morning... but did you not get to make a lunchbox for today?」

Touko
「Uhh... Well, I did make one... but I actually messed up juuust～ a little bit... Um... Do I have to get it out?」


％Ｂ
「It'd be a waste to not eat it after you went through the trouble of making it, right? Plus, it's gonna go bad in the heat if you just leave it.」

Touko
「Uuuh... Okay. But you better not laugh, okay...? Don't look too much...」

She reluctantly pulls the lunchbox out from inside her bag.
The cloth wrapping and lunchbox itself have cutesy, girly designs.
Touko
「It's embarrassing... so I'll only show 
you, Ryousuke-kun
you
...」

...The lunchbox conversation's taken a strangely erotic tone.
I'm close to getting turned on by her bashfulness and the way she said that just now.

all
She opens the lunchbox.
Inside are... some misshapen, slightly burnt fried eggs, and some octopus-shaped sausages with varying numbers of legs of varying thicknesses.

％Ｂ
「Oh, it's not bad at all. I thought it was gonna be way worse.」

Touko
「...But it isn't pretty at all.」
％Ｂ
「Let's dig in, then.」
all
I take one of the fried eggs and pop it in my mouth.
It tastes... Yup. I just taste the bitter burnt parts and the egg itself.
She hasn't seasoned these.
Touko
「Oh... Are you okay? Your stomach doesn't hurt, does it?」
％Ｂ
「I won't get an upset stomach that easily. Don't worry, it's edible.」

Touko
「But it's burnt... and the shape's all messy too.」
％Ｂ
「The shape doesn't decide how it tastes. It's a bit burnt, yeah... but I think we can just say the bitterness adds a bit of an accent?」

Touko
「The stuffing's poking out from inside the rice balls... and they're all lumpy. They don't look great, do they?」

％Ｂ
「You kneaded these into shape, right? That already makes them taste way better than normal rice balls.」

all
I pop one thing after another from Touko's handmade lunch into my mouth.
The rice balls make a crunching sound in my mouth as I chew them. Probably because the salt was clustered unevenly.
The uneven octopus-shaped sausages are slightly undercooked.
Looks like she forgot to put dressing on the salad.
Each and every thing could definitely be improved.
But none of the contents are heated-up frozen foods or ready-made.
I can tell she really tried for me. It makes me happy.
％Ｂ
「Mh... Thanks for the meal. I think I might've wanted a little more volume.」
I toss the final piece of fried egg in my mouth.
I'm already done. There wasn't that much to eat.
Touko
「...Sorry. That didn't taste very good, did it?」
％Ｂ
「Don't worry about it. I'll just keep it in mind from now on.」
Touko
「No, I don't think this is good, as a girl... Everyone else was able to cook when we went camping too...」

％Ｂ
「Uhh... Everyone's different. You still have plenty of time to grow.」

Touko
「...So that means where I am right now isn't good, right? It's just barely edible.」

...Being encouraging is hard.
all
％Ｂ
「Hellooo. ％Ａ from the event committee heeere.」
Misa
「Oh, hello there.」
Marika
「It's just you today? Yukimura-san isn't with you?」
％Ｂ
「Touko's handling the old school building. We won't be able to get everything done today unless we work on stuff separately...」

Misa
「Would you like to take a breather? I can have some tea ready right away.」
％Ｂ
「Haha, that would be great. Thank you very much.」
Okihara-senpai disappears into the prep room.
This room is relaxing and comforting amidst the savage rush to get preparations done going on throughout the rest of the school.

Marika
「You must be busy now that it's summer break, since everyone's on their last spurt.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah... To be honest, I was expecting this to be easier.」
Marika
「Ahahah. But the Tanabata Festival is going to be more fun the more work we put in. I'm sure Yukimura-san's looking forward to it too.」

％Ｂ
「...Yeah.」
Marika
「...What's wrong?」
Shinozaki doesn't know that Touko's moving away yet.
I can't let her figure it out by being depressed here. I need to change the subject.

％Ｂ
「No, nothing. We've all been doing a ton of work, so I'm looking forward to the day of. How's helping Okihara-senpai going?」

Marika
「We're working hard every day. I always look forward to her tea.」
％Ｂ
「...You guys are doing work, right?」
Marika
「A-Ahaha... Of course we are. Though we end up chatting for a while sometimes.」

Misa
「Thank you very much for waiting. I carelessly broke one of the teacups the other day, and so... Please forgive me.」


...It's been about a month since the last time.
If anything, the tea-filled beaker seems almost nostalgic to me.
all
I'd feel guilty to just sit back and drink tea.
I should help out a bit with what they're doing while I'm on break.
％Ｂ
「Excuse me, I'll also...」
Shinozaki stands up just as I'm about to say "help."
Marika
「Oh, I just had a good idea.」
％Ｂ
「Hm? What?」
Marika
「Let's decide on a day for us to all meet up and eat lunch together. What do you think?」


Misa
「That sounds wonderful! I would love to participate!」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, I think that sounds fun. We should ask everyone and figure out where we're eating too.」

Marika
「I'll send out the message, since I was the one who came up with the idea.」
She immediately pulls out her phone and starts drafting out a message.
She seems like she's really looking forward to it, judging by her smile as she types.

Misa
「We will all be bringing lunchboxes to share, yes? I am excited to see what kind of fish we may be able to eat.」

...I'm very sorry to disappoint you, Senpai.
But not every lunchbox has fish in it.
all
【Marika】「We will be having a #Nlunchbox party! Let's #Nall eat lunch together.」
【Marika】「It would be very nice #Nif we could all bring #Nlunches to share. #NPlease let us know what #Nday would work for you.」
【Marika】_st_0103
Marika
「I hope we can hold our lunchbox party soon. Ehehe, I'm so excited.」
all
...There's a problem here.
The part about "bringing lunches to share."
I saw Touko's level of ability for myself today.
There's a chance Touko won't want to participate.
She's gotten motivated to improve as of today, but I wonder if it'll be okay...
％Ｂ
「Why don't we do this in the old school building? I think we'll be able to relax and enjoy lunch there.」

Misa
「Would it be okay for us to intrude?」
％Ｂ
「Yes. I'll let Touko know.」
all
I guess all that's left is for me to convince her to come...
％Ｂ
「I'm baaack...」
Touko
「Oh, welcome baaack... Wow, you look so tired. Are you okay?」
％Ｂ
「...I'm not sure if I'll be able to keep going like this.」
Touko
「I bought some drinks earlier. Want one?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, I'll take one. I'm parched.」
all
Touko hands me a drink and I drain it in one go.
It's like I can feel the cool water molecules surging through my entire body. It re-energizes me a bit.
％Ｂ
「Ahh... I feel alive again.」
Touko
「By the way, I got that message from Flower-chan about a lunchbox party.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, that came up when I dropped by the naturalist clubroom earlier. Shinozaki and Okihara-senpai seemed real excited.」

Touko
「Mmm... I'm happy about getting to eat lots of different things, but I won't be able to bring anything, you know.」

％Ｂ
「I figured you'd say that, so you're providing the location. I asked everyone if they wanted to eat here.」

Touko
「We're going to do the lunchbox party here? All of us together?」
％Ｂ
「We've never done anything together in the old school building, right? It'll be their first time here, so we should extend a proper invitation.」

Touko
「...」
％Ｂ
「Let's make some good memories together with everyone. We can take some photos of all of us and stuff too.」

Touko
「...Good memories.」
％Ｂ
「I want the others to know about this place too. It's our important place, so I want us to remember it... and have a record of it too.」


We'll be giving shape to the time we've spent here.
Not just by taking photos, but also with all of our smiles.
％Ｂ
「Just remembering things isn't what makes good memories. I'm sure you'll get what I mean once we all spend time together, with all of us feeling the same way.」

Touko
「...Okay.」
We hold hands, just like always.
I hold my phone up to our clasped hands and take a photo.
I want to connect her hands with lots of others.
Let's think about what I can do for Touko... and do them one at a time.
Touko
「...I've decided. I'll... tell them that I'm moving then.」
％Ｂ
「...Okay. Let me know if there's anything I can do to help, all right?」
Touko
「Mhm, thanks. I'll be counting on you.」
Female Student C
「Excuse meee.」
all
％Ｂ
「Whoa!? Y-You need something!?」
Female Student C
「We found this inside the storage closet for cleaning supplies... We didn't know if it was okay to get rid of it...」

It's a hard plastic case with a handle.
It's been sealed shut with duct tape. It's got a clear "Don't open this!" vibe to it.

％Ｂ
「...I wonder what's inside.」
Female Student C
「The boys were trying to open it for fun, but it was too creepy for us... and so we decided to hand it to the event committee, since it seemed dangerous.」


％Ｂ
「Well... It does look a little ominous. All right, we'll take it.」

I accept the case from her.
It's lighter than I expected. I shake it a bit, and I can definitely feel something inside.

Female Student C
「Thank you very much. And, well... we have another request.」

％Ｂ
「A request?」
Female Student C
「Please let us know what's inside if you open it.」
They think it's creepy, but they're apparently still curious about the contents.
...Wait a second, I'm opening this!?
％Ｂ
「Didn't think they'd have something like this here still. I'm surprised it hasn't been disposed of yet.」

We've looked over the case thoroughly.
We've surmised that it's something like a time capsule from some faded text we found on it.

Touko
「...This must've been a really special place for someone.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, maybe. Since they left something like this behind.」
Touko
「It's super scruffy-looking, though. They should've put it in a more durable box.」

％Ｂ
「We probably shouldn't just open this... What should we do with it?」
Touko
「Mmm... I don't think we have any choice but to just leave it. We don't know who left it here, so we can't give it back or anything.」


％Ｂ
「That's true. I'll ask Shuuichi about it later.」
all
I'll just leave it in the corner so it isn't in the way for now.
I can bring it up to him when I have the time.
％Ｂ
「Gh!?」
The case must've really deteriorated over the years.
The handle snaps and the case falls onto the ground.
％Ｂ
「Crap! It broke...!」
The hinge of the case broke from the impact.

Touko
「...Are these letters? There's cardstock too. It... It looks like these are signature cards.」

Touko gathers up the contents.
It looks like the case contained a lot of what look like sealed letters and a single piece of cardstock for signatures.

Touko
「Look. There's a date written here.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, you're right. Let's see... It's from twenty-five years ago.」
all
It seems like one of those "To my future self" kind of things.
I bet the cardstock's filled with farewells between classmates and stuff.
％Ｂ
「We shouldn't look at this. Let's put everything away into an envelope or something.」

Touko
「Mm, you're right. Should make sure we don't lose any of...」
％Ｂ
「...Touko? What's wrong?」
Touko
「Ahaha... It's nothing. You're right, we really shouldn't be looking at these.」

％Ｂ
「Oh, wait...!」
all
...What was written on there?
I feel guilty about it, but I look through the contents.
％Ｂ
「...」
It just looks like a normal card full of signatures, from what I can tell.
None of the comments really seem to stick out to me...
％Ｂ
「Aagh!?」
I freak out when my phone buzzes in my pocket, because I was a little anxious about looking at the cards when I knew I shouldn't have been.

It's... Shuuichi.

％Ｂ
「Don't call me out of nowhere like that! You freaked me out!」
Shuuichi
『Excuse me!? How the heck am I supposed to tell you in advance that I'm gonna call, idiot!?』
％Ｂ
「Just do it indirectly! Make me understand somehow!」
Shuuichi
『What, you want us to communicate telepathically!? That's gross!』
Though I needed to talk to Shuuichi anyway.
I need to tell him about the time capsule... You got off lucky today, Shuuichi.

％Ｂ
「So what'd you call me for?」
Shuuichi
『There's something I wanted to ask you to do. I'm busy right now, so I decided to just tell you directly. I need you to go out and buy some materials. Can you do it?』


％Ｂ
「Yeah, fine by me. You need them right away?」
Shuuichi
『It isn't urgent. You can bring them tomorrow if it's too much trouble for you to come back here after getting them.』

％Ｂ
「All right. I'll bring them tomorrow then.」
Shuuichi
『Come to the event committee office later. I'll get a shopping list ready for you.』

％Ｂ
「Roger that. Also, I've got something I want you to hold onto.」
Shuuichi
『Something for me to hold onto? What?』
％Ｂ
「Someone handed us a time capsule they found in the old school building that was probably left behind by old students. But I broke the case... so I want you to hold onto just the contents.」


Shuuichi
『A time capsule... All right. I'll take them.』

％Ｂ
「Great. I'll come by later, then.」
_smh_st_04
And that's that.
But there's still one question on my mind.
％Ｂ
「...What happened with Touko?」
【％Ｂ】「What happened today?」
【Touko】「What do you mean?」
【％Ｂ】「You seemed kinda down #Nafter that thing with #Nthe time capsule.」
【Touko】「I'm fine.」
【Touko】「It was nothing.」
...Am I just overthinking things?
I can't really get much out of "It was nothing" over just text.

【Touko】「Anyway, can I look #Nforward to lunch #Ntomorrow?」
【％Ｂ】「What do you wanna eat?」
【Touko】「Something tasty!」
【％Ｂ】「Give me something more #Nspecific.」
【Touko】「Something summery.」
【％Ｂ】「That's tough.」
【Touko】「Something that isn't #Noily.」
【％Ｂ】「Got it. I'll think of #Nsomething.」
【Touko】「Yay!」
【Touko】「Night then.」
【％Ｂ】「Night.」
％Ｂ
「...Maybe I am overthinking it.」
