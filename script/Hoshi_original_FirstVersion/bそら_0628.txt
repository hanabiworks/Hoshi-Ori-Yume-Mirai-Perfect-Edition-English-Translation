「Nn... agh...」
$$smh_OpenCHK
％Ｂ
「Fuah...nh... aaahhhh... Afh... ahh...」
％Ｂ
「...Heheh.」
I grin as soon as I wake up.
I get out of bed and pull back the curtains.
The morning sunlight is bright.
My first morning as someone with a girlfriend feels incredibly refreshing.
％Ｂ
「Whoops... What time is it?」
I sit back down on my bed and check my phone.
Nine a.m.
Looks like I got a decent amount of sleep for a weekend.
％Ｂ
「I know. I think I'll send Sora a good-morning message.」
I start up the app.
【％Ｂ】「Morning! Awake already? #NSorry if I woke you up.」
【％Ｂ】「I just woke up myself. #NSleep well last night? #NI couldn't really get #Nto sleep, so I was up #Nfor a while.」
【％Ｂ】「Why's that, you ask? #NObviously it's because #NI was thinking about #Nyou the whole」
％Ｂ
「...No, wait. Wouldn't she get really grossed out if I sent her something like this the morning after? And I sound way too excited...」

I delete all of what I had typed.
％Ｂ
「Uhh, a little simpler...」
【％Ｂ】「Morning! Have any good #Ndreams last night? Any #Nabout me lol?」
％Ｂ
「No, I feel like this is even cringier...」
％Ｂ
「And besides, starting it off with an exclamation point really makes me look way too happy. I need to come across as more composed and―」

％Ｂ
「Hm...?」
I've got a message.
It's from―
％Ｂ
「Uh... Sora?」
【Sora】「Morning」
％Ｂ
「Whoa!?」
It's none other than a good-morning message from Sora!
And what's more, there isn't a single punctuation mark to be seen, much less an exclamation point.\n\r
It's like she's providing an example of how it's supposed to be done...
％Ｂ
「I didn't think she'd be the one to send me one first... What a surprise.」
I know we're dating now, but I didn't think she was the type to be assertive about things like this.

It's a new side to her that I didn't know about before.
I doubt anyone else knows about it either.
It's something only I could learn after becoming her boyfriend.
％Ｂ
「Whoops, more importantly, I should respond...」
【％Ｂ】「Morning. Thanks for the #Nmessage. I was actually #Njust about to send you #None myself.」
【％Ｂ】「Weather's great today. #NWe need to hurry up and #Ndecide what we're doing #Nfor the Tanabata #NFestival, so do you #Nwanna meet today? If #Nit's okay with you.」
I'm inviting her out on a date on the pretense of it having to do with the festival.
I'm planning on discussing it with her though, of course.
Her response is immediate.
【Sora】「I want to see you」
％Ｂ
「Hngh...!」
I almost collapse in reaction to the simple response.
Not "I'm free," nor is it "Let's meet."
It's "I want to see you."
The way you can tell she genuinely wants to see me today is making me so happy it's driving me crazy!

【％Ｂ】「Let's do that, then. #NAnywhere you wanna go?」
【Sora】「I want to see the stars」
％Ｂ
「She wants to see the stars...? So we're meeting at night, then?」
【％Ｂ】「Okay. When do you wanna #Nmeet up? Any time's fine #Nwith me.」
【Sora】「11. Entrance to the #Nshopping mall」
％Ｂ
「Eleven o'clock... Tomorrow's Sunday, so I guess it's fine if we're out late.」
【％Ｂ】「Roger that. I'll see you #Nat 11!」
I wait a bit for her response, but nothing comes.
％Ｂ
「Eleven o'clock, huh... I've got a lot of time to kill.」
Pretty much an entire day.
％Ｂ
「I guess I'll just take my time doing housework or something.」
％Ｂ
「Phew... There we go.」
I take a look at the time after doing some cleaning.
It's almost noon.
％Ｂ
「Let's get started on making some lunch.」
％Ｂ
「Hm...?」
My phone rings from on top of the table.
Looks like someone's calling me.
％Ｂ
「...Sora?」
Sora's name is displayed on the screen.
I wonder if she wants to meet at a different time.

％Ｂ
「Yes, hello?」
Sora
『...Are you okay?』
％Ｂ
「Hm? I'm fine... Something the matter?」
Sora
『...I called because I was worried.』
％Ｂ
「You were worried?」
Sora
『...Because you didn't come when it was time.』
％Ｂ
「Wha... When it was time?」
I take a look at the time again.
It's currently 11:52 a.m...
％Ｂ
「...When you said we were meeting at eleven... Did you mean 11 a.m.!?」
Sora
『...*nod*』
％Ｂ
「I'm sorry! I just figured it'd be 11 p.m. 'cause you said you wanted to see stars! I'm seriously so sorry! Where are you right now!?」

Sora
『...Mall entrance.』
％Ｂ
「I'll be there right away! I promise!」
I've already screwed things up!
I can't believe I ended up completely late for my first date!
Sora
『...You don't need to hurry. Be careful on your way here.』
％Ｂ
「O-Okay. Anyway, I'll get ready right away and head over, so I'm gonna hang up. I'm so sorry!」

_smh_st_04
I hang up and frantically start getting ready.
％Ｂ
「Aghh, dammit! What the hell am I doing...!?」
I need to get there as soon as possible...!
I sprint to the mall.
It's currently a little past 12:30.
I got ready and arrived here in pretty impressive time, but I'm still over an hour and a half late from the original time...


％Ｂ
「Sora!」
She's standing where we were supposed to meet up.
％Ｂ
「Hahh, hahh, s-sorry... I'm seriously... so sorry... Hahh...」
Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「It was hot out here, wasn't it...? Hahh... You could've just waited inside somewhere...」
Sora
「...I said you didn't need to hurry, but you ran...」
Sora takes out a handkerchief from her bag and wipes the sweat from my face.

％Ｂ
「...Thanks.」
Sora
「...Mm.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, I'll wash that for you and give it back to you later.」
I hold out my hand so she can give me the sweat-stained handkerchief.
Sora
「...Not necessary.」
％Ｂ
「But you don't want a handkerchief with my sweat all over it, do you?」

Sora
「...No issues if it's your sweat
, Ryou

.」
She then casually places the handkerchief back in her bag.
Sora
「...More importantly, I want to see the stars.」
％Ｂ
「Y-Yeah, I know... But how do you see stars in the middle of the day...?」
Sora
「...Mm.」
She points into the mall.
％Ｂ
「Oh... You meant the planetarium?」
The science museum's past the mall here.
I'm pretty sure it has an attached planetarium.
Sora
「...*nod*」
Oh, I get it... That explains why we were supposed to meet up at 11 a.m. too.
Sora
「...I'm sorry.」
％Ｂ
「Wha...?」
Sora
「...This is all because I didn't explain properly.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, uh... No, that's not...」
％Ｂ
「It's more my fault for not making sure. It's not your fault, Sora.」

Sora
「...*shake shake*」
Sora
「...There would've been no issue if I had said planetarium. I'll be careful from now on.」

％Ｂ
「And I'll make sure not to jump to conclusions from now on too.」
％Ｂ
「In fact, I'm gonna get to the point where I can tell what you wanna say just from looking at your eyes.」

Sora
「...
Ryou
Mm
...」
％Ｂ
「Either way, I'm sorry for making you wait today.」
％Ｂ
「I know we're way past the time we agreed on, but is the planetarium still doing stuff now...?」

Sora
「...I think the afternoon showing starts at one.」
％Ｂ
「That's perfect timing if we go now, then. Let's get going.」

Sora
「...*nod*」
all
The two of us walk side by side, toward the planetarium.
％Ｂ
「...」
I want to hold hands... but I guess it's too early for that.
_ef_ryusen03
_ef_ryusen04
I sit next to Sora and look up at the ceiling while listening to the narration.
The stars at the planetarium are prettier than anything I've ever seen up until now.

It's completely different from what we can see up on the school's roof.
Though that's to be expected, since this is all artificial.
But knowing it's man-made doesn't make the sight any less grand...

Narration
「You are now currently seeing the summer night sky. When one thinks of summer, one thinks of Tanabata. When one thinks of Tanabata, one thinks of Orihime and Hikoboshi. Do you know which two stars are Orihime and Hikoboshi?」


Narration
「Orihime refers to Vega, a first-magnitude star in the constellation Lyra. Lyra would be over here. Vega is the brightest star in Lyra, and one of 21 first-magnitude stars in the sky.」


Vega's brightness intensifies as the narration indicates it.
Narration
「And next is Hikoboshi. Hikoboshi refers to Altair, in the constellation Aquila, once again the brightest star in its constellation. Like Vega, Altair is one of the 21 first-magnitude stars.」


Narration
「And when you connect Vega, Altair, and also Deneb in the constellation Cygnus together―」

Lines connect the three stars on the ceiling screen, forming a big triangle.

Narration
「There. We've formed a large triangle. This is known as the Summer Triangle.」

％Ｂ
「...」
I already knew about all this from what Sora's told me, but it's actually pretty fun hearing it again like this.

The artificial stars are more distinct than the stars you can actually see outside, and you can see lots of stars you usually couldn't with the naked eye too.

The explanations are really easy to follow visually too, with the stars brightening and lines being drawn on the sky.

％Ｂ
「Hm...」
I unfold my arms and place my hand back onto the chair arm as I'm listening to the narration.

％Ｂ
「Gh...!?」
My hand makes just the slightest bit of contact with Sora's hand, which had already been on the chair arm.

％Ｂ
「...」
I nervously look at her.
Sora
「...」
Sora's looking straight up at the starry sky.
It's like she hasn't even noticed what happened.
Or maybe it's more like she did notice, but she's just not paying any attention at all to trivial things around her while she's watching the stars.


Which is just like her.
So I guess I'm the only one who's nervous here...
％Ｂ
「Phew...」
Well, I guess if Sora doesn't mind, this is fine.
It's just the sides of our pinkies touching a bit anyway...
Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「...!?」
I feel something on my pinky as soon as I return my gaze to the stars.
I look to see Sora's intertwined her pinky with mine.
It's... not a coincidence, right?
This is clearly a conscious action.
％Ｂ
「...」
I look at Sora's face.
She's still looking up at the sky.
She seems completely the same as usual.
Sora
「...」
But she's definitely wrapping her pinky around mine.
How am I supposed to interpret this...?
％Ｂ
「...」
It'd be the epitome of tactlessness to just up and ask her...
"Holding hands is embarrassing, so just this much for now"... must be what she's trying to say.

I nervously look back up at the sky.
％Ｂ
「...」
...I can't.
All of my attention's focused on my pinky. This might actually be more embarrassing than holding hands.

I can't even tell what the narration's saying anymore, and my heart's beating out of my chest.

It makes me happy... but I'm at my wit's end...
We leave the planetarium after the show ends.
Sora
「...Was it fun?」
％Ｂ
「Hm? Y-Yeah... It was fun. In lots of ways...」
Though I don't remember much of what the show was halfway through after what happened.
％Ｂ
「The stars looked really pretty. There were lots of them too. Though I doubt you could ever actually see that many stars without a telescope or anything.」


Sora
「...There are places where you can.」
％Ｂ
「Huh? There really are?」
Sora
「...There are places where you can see just as many stars as you could in that planetarium, if all the conditions are right.」

％Ｂ
「Like where?」
Sora
「...Mauna Kea, the Atacama Desert, Lake Tekapo. All famous places for stargazing.」

％Ｂ
「Huh, so places like that exist. But those aren't in Japan, judging by the names.」

Sora
「Mauna Kea is a volcano in Hawaii. It's 4,205 meters tall. Its name means "White Mountain," and it houses thirteen observatories from eleven countries all around the world. It's where Japan's Subaru is too.」




％Ｂ
「Oh, I've heard of the Subaru Telescope before. So that's in Hawaii?」

Sora
「...The Atacama Desert is on the Pacific Ocean side of Chile's Andes mountain range. It's located at an elevation of 2,000 meters, and its dry air makes it ideal for stargazing.」


Sora
「Like Mauna Kea, the Atacama Desert hosts observatories from lots of countries. Japan also has its Nanten Observatory and ASTE telescope there.」

％Ｂ
「O...Oh really... I see.」
Sora
「...Lake Tekapo is in the southern island of New Zealand. The skies are very clear there, and you can see the Southern Cross and the Magellanic Clouds well.」

Sora
「The people who live there are very supportive of stargazing, and place covers on streetlights and use sodium-vapor lamps to reduce light pollution to preserve the ability to see the stars.」


％Ｂ
「Wow... Though it's kind of a shame that they're all overseas.」
Sora
「...If you want to see pretty stars, somewhere that's far from civilization with clear air and zero humidity is ideal.」

％Ｂ
「I get it. It'd be cool to go somewhere like that at least once.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「And it'd be great... if we could go together.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
She blushes a bit as she nods.
Though it was embarrassing for me to say too.
％Ｂ
「Speaking of, what's the best spot for seeing stars in Shionagi?」
Sora
「...Either the coast or the park.」
％Ｂ
「Really. Then let's go to the park once it's nighttime so we can do some stargazing. It might not be as pretty as the planetarium or Mauna Kea, but we can relax and look at the real thing.」


Sora
「...*nod*」
Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「...Hungry?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, now that I think about it, we haven't had lunch yet. There's still time before it gets dark, so let's get something to eat.」

Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「It'll be my treat, as a way of making up for being late. What do you want? Anything's fine. It can even be a bit on the expensive side. Let's go get what you wanna eat!」


Sora
「...*nod*」
all
Sora
「Hamh... nmh, nmh... It's good.」
％Ｂ
「...I'm glad.」
Lunch is burgers.
Even though I said anything was fine...
Though it's okay as long as it's something Sora wanted to eat.
Sora
「...」
After a while of eating Sora starts staring intently at the eaten-away parts of her burger.

％Ｂ
「Something wrong?」
Sora
「...I can't find any.」
％Ｂ
「Any what? Oh, you're talking about pickles. You don't like those, right? I had them take them out beforehand.」

Sora
「...That's possible?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. You can just tell them to hold the pickles when you order, and they won't put them in.」

Sora
「...You should've said that sooner...」
％Ｂ
「R-Right... Sorry.」
She got a bit mad.
Sora
「...But thanks.」
％Ｂ
「Mm... You're welcome.」
Sora
「...Now I don't have to have you eat my pickles...」
...Oh no.
Now I don't get to have that indirect kiss anymore.
What have I done...?
Sora
「...But that's also a bit of a shame...」
％Ｂ
「Hm? What do you mean?」
Sora
「...I kind of liked having you eat the pickles.


」
％Ｂ
「...Want me to have them put the pickles in next time?」

Sora
「...I'll... let you handle it.」
Her cheeks are a bit red.
all
We wandered around waiting for the sun to set after our late lunch, and then went to the park.

％Ｂ
「...Now that I think about it, I guess this is where I first met you.」

Sora
「...*nod*」
It's not like I remember it vividly enough to feel nostalgic about it, but I can at least dimly remember that night.

％Ｂ
「You were standing around there when I found you, right?」
Sora
「...No. Over there.」
％Ｂ
「O-Oh really... And I came from this way, right?」
Sora
「...No. The opposite way.」
％Ｂ
「Uhh... You were looking at the western skies?」
Sora
「...Northern.」
Welp, all wrong...
％Ｂ
「I don't remember any of the details... Sorry.」
Sora
「...*shake shake*」
Sora
「...But you remembered that you pulled me by my hand.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, I definitely remember that. And that we talked about constellations, and that we ate candied strawberries.」

Sora
「...And that's enough
, Ryou

. I'm happy just that you've remembered me.」

％Ｂ
「R-Really...」
Sora
「...Let's sit on that bench.」
all
I sit next to her on the bench, and we look up at the sky.
Sora
「...There aren't many lights around this park. Though that might not be a good thing.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah... You're right, it's dangerous to have fewer streetlights.」
Sora
「...But it's easier to see the stars thanks to that.」
The stars aren't as clear as they were in the planetarium, but we can still see them nicely.

From what I can tell with the naked eye, it feels like there are more visible stars here than I've seen from up on the rooftop.

％Ｂ
「Oh, found Vega! Then you go down to the southeast... and there's Altair too. And then to the left... and you hit Deneb! And that's the Summer Triangle.」

Sora
「...*nod* Not bad.」
％Ｂ
「It's 'cause I've got a good teacher. She's taught me an easy-to-remember way to find them. I was able to tell Shinozaki how to find them the other day too.」

Sora
「...There is nothing more I can teach you. You graduate disciplehood.」
％Ｂ
「Already!? But I can't even hold a candle to you yet, Master!」

We smile and laugh quietly while joking around.
％Ｂ
「...You know, that planetarium today was amazing. Though your explanations are more detailed than the narration was.」

Sora
「...My explanations aren't gentle. I need to become able to explain in ways that are easier to understand, or I could never be a star lady.」


％Ｂ
「Star lady? You mean like the staff member who was talking about the stars at the planetarium?」

Sora
「...*nod*」
Sora
「They communicate the wonders of stars. I respect them.」
％Ｂ
「Really. So your dream's to become one of the ladies who explain the stars at planetariums.」

Sora
「...? Is it?」
％Ｂ
「Wha? Uh... I just figured that was where this conversation was going. Am I wrong?」

Sora
「...I never thought about it that much... but your reasoning is sound...



」
...Did we just decide on Sora's career prospects...?
Sora
「...Wow. You cleared everything up for me.」
％Ｂ
「D-Did I? If I was helpful, then I'm glad...」
...Hm? Something Sora would be motivated to do, that's fitting for the astronomy club...

％Ｂ
「Hey, Sora. About what the astronomy club's gonna do for the Tanabata Festival... How about a planetarium?」

Sora
「...A planetarium...?」
She looks at me with a puzzled expression.
％Ｂ
「We could make a planetarium up on the roof. And you can do a narration about the stars inside.」

Sora
「...」
She doesn't say anything, but her eyes glimmer.
She seems pretty into my idea.
％Ｂ
「What do you think? Not bad, right? The naturalist club's making an aquarium, right? Then let's have the astronomy club make a planetarium!」


Sora
「...It'd be amazing if we could do it.」
％Ｂ
「We can! We can do it for sure! I can help with preparing and getting whatever we need, and the others all said they'd help too, right?」


％Ｂ
「There's still time before the festival, so I'm sure we'll make it in time if we start preparing now. What do you think? How about a planetarium?」

Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「Think you might wanna try it?」
Sora
「...*nod*... I want to try.」
％Ｂ
「Then...!」
Sora
「...But there's an issue.」
％Ｂ
「An issue?」
Sora
「...I don't know... if I can do the narration well.」
％Ｂ
「You can just do it like you always do for me.」
Sora
「...I can do it like that because it's you
, Ryou

.」
She says it casually, but it makes me happy.
％Ｂ
「Let's see... Then what if you imagined all of the guests as me?」

Sora
「...The guests are all 
Ryou
you
...」
Sora
「...」
Sora
「...Imagining being watched by lots of 
Ryous
you
... makes me feel too happy...」

Kh... That's just making me feel even happier.
％Ｂ
「We can worry about the narration later. What do you think about the planetarium in general?」

Sora
「...No issues there. I want to try doing it too. I'll be able to communicate the wonders of the stars to lots of people with a planetarium.」

％Ｂ
「All right. Then let's propose making a planetarium at the event committee meeting at the beginning of the week!」

Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「Oh... And one more thing. I was thinking of telling everyone that we've started dating. Is that okay?」

Sora
「...We're telling them?」
％Ｂ
「We could stay quiet about it, but I feel like that might make things weird between all of us.」

Sora
「...No issues. I want them to know too.」
％Ｂ
「Then I'll tell them, "Sora and I are dating now," when we see them.」

Sora
「...*nod*」
Sora nods, her cheeks flushing with embarrassment.
