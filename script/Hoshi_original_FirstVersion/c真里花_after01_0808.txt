「Yes! This is the Azuma Morio Architectural Firm! Thank you very much! I actually just sent you a fax on the matter!」


％Ｂ
「Thank you very much!」
％Ｂ
「All right, now I need to call the contractor, and then...」
Firm Staff A
「You seem like you're in a good mood today.」
％Ｂ
「Huh? Do I? I'm always in a good mood, though.」
Firm Staff B
「It's because you passed the subject portion of the first-class exam, right? Congratulations.」
％Ｂ
「Thank you very much! I can't relax yet, since there's still the drafting exam in October... but I'll definitely pass that too!」


Firm Staff A
「S-Sure... You're really raring to go.」
％Ｂ
「Like I said, that's not...」
Azuma
「A woman for sure.」
％Ｂ
「Urghh!!」
all
Firm Staff B
「Oh? Looks like he's right.」
％Ｂ
「N-No... I'm just really passionate about work...」
Azuma
「When a man gets passionate about work, it's because of a woman, ten times out of ten.」
％Ｂ
「Ten times out of... Azuma-san, is that why you work?」

Azuma
「Of course.」
What a comeback....
Azuma
「Something happened, right?」
％Ｂ
「Well, uh...」
She may have accepted my proposal... but we haven't told her parents about it yet.\n\r

I'll need to pass the second exam for that, so...
％Ｂ
「I'm sure I'll be able to tell you all what it is soon, so if you could please wait a little longer...」

Azuma
「That so? Sure, then. Get excited and work as hard as you'd like.」

％Ｂ
「...Yes!」

First, I have to pass the first-class exams.
I'll tell Marika's parents about our engagement after that.
And I'll finish the Oono residence case too.
...Or so I thought.
％Ｂ
「Huh? Seriously?」
Marika
「Yes, seriously～ My dad found out that you proposed to me...」

％Ｂ
「I-Is... that so...」
Her dad's face comes to mind. I haven't seen him in a while.
Marika
「Sorry... I was going to keep it a secret from him until after you passed your exams...」

Marika
「But I was trying to tell just my mom, and he happened to overhear us... I'm so sorry!」


％Ｂ
「N-No... It's fine. It's not like it's a lie that I proposed or anything. So... what'd your dad say?」

Marika
「He was kinda bright red.」
％Ｂ
「K-Kinda bright red?」
Marika
「I thought his head was going to explode.」
％Ｂ
「I see...」
Marika
「And... he said to invite you over sometime...」
Marika
「And... he said to invite you over sometime...」
％Ｂ
「To invite me over?」
Well... Yeah, that makes sense.
Marika
「Is the weekend okay? I can tell him you're busy and can't come if you want...」

％Ｂ
「No, I'll go. I think it'd be good to say it properly anyway. This weekend works fine.」


Marika
「...Okay. Got it. I'll let him know, then.」
％Ｂ
「Please tell him I'm excited to see him.」

I automatically go into formal mode.
Telling her parents, huh.
I've met them a lot already, but this really makes me nervous.
It would've been nice if I could've had more time to prepare myself... but there's nothing I can do about that now.
