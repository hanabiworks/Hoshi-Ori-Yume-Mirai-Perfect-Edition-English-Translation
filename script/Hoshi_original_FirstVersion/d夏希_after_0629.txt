「I'm hooome.」
Natsuki pops out to greet me as soon as I get home.
Natsuki
「Welcome home!」
Natsuki
「Mmm～ ...Chu♪」
％Ｂ
「Chu... Mh... You're home early today.」
Natsuki
「Mhm, well... You know, 'cause today's... So I asked Sensei to go home early.」

She seems a little fidgety.
Right. Today's June 29th.
It's an "anniversary" of sorts for us.
all
The food on the table's a little more lavish than our usual dinners.

％Ｂ
「Ooh, did you come home early to make all this?」

Natsuki
「Mhm. I put in a bit of effort for the occasion.」
％Ｂ
「Sorry, I should've bought something on the way back.」
Natsuki
「No, I'm happy you got home as early as possible.」
％Ｂ
「You really go all out for this day every year, don't you?」
Natsuki
「Well yeah, of course I would, right? It was a really happy day for us...」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. Since─」
It's the day we started dating.
It's the day we first kissed.
It's the day we did it the first time.
％Ｂ
「It's the day we started dating, after all.」
％Ｂ
「It's the day we did it for the first time, after all.」
Natsuki
「...」
U-Uh?
Maybe I'm remembering wrong?
Natsuki
「Sigh... Well yeah, that was a happy day for us too...」
％Ｂ
「I-I was kidding, obviously! I know what day it really is!」

Calm down. I need to think hard and remember.
Today's June 29th... What'd Natsuki and I do on this day six years ago...?
Don't think too generally... I need to be more specific, use process of elimination...
It's something worth celebrating... that we did the first time... together...
That's right! It's the day Natsuki and I went on our first date!
And―
％Ｂ
「It's the day we had our first kiss... Right?」
Natsuki
「Why's that a question?」
％Ｂ
「It's the day we had our first kiss! Yeah! No mistake! There's no way I'd forget.」

I'm gonna be in a whole lot of trouble if I'm still wrong...
Natsuki
「...」
Natsuki and I went to a photo gallery for our first date on this day six years ago, and we kissed for the first time as we were about to go home.

Or at least I think so.
Natsuki
「Ehehe... Yeah, you're right. You wouldn't forget. It's a really special day for me... I'm so glad you remembered!」


％Ｂ
「Not just for you, but for us... Right?」
Natsuki
「Mhm♪」
All right! I'm in the clear! Natsuki's smiling!
Now that I think about it, I vaguely remember doing the exact same thing last year...
I'll need to make sure I don't forget again next year...
％Ｂ
「It's the day we had our first kiss, after all.」
Natsuki
「Wow... You remember...」
％Ｂ
「Of course I do. We went to that photo gallery for our first date on this day six years ago. And the theme of the gallery was "lovers"... I can still remember everything we saw that day, down to the photos at that gallery.」


Natsuki
「Mhm, mhm! Me too!」
％Ｂ
「I remember I played that claw machine in front of the arcade after we went to the gallery, and that I ended up not being able to get that stuffed animal you wanted.」

Natsuki
「Mhm. It was fun watching you get so stubborn about it.」



％Ｂ
「And then you treated me to ice cream after that. I had mint chocolate, and you had a double scoop of strawberry cheese and chocolate chip.」


Natsuki
「You even remember all that...」
％Ｂ
「And then at the end of the date, we had our first kiss.」
Natsuki
「Mhm... Yeah. June 29th's always been a special day for me ever since then.」


％Ｂ
「Not just for you, though. It's special for me too.」
Natsuki
「
Ryousuke...
Ehehe...
」
She smiles and looks at me.
I respond by hugging her tight and kissing her.

％Ｂ
「But why's the day we first kissed more important to you than the day we started dating?」

Natsuki
「That's because... it's the day we first connected as lovers.」
％Ｂ
「First connected... That's kind of a dirty way of saying it.」
Natsuki
「Stupid. That's not what I meant. I could always just go shopping and stuff with a friend, right?」

Natsuki
「A confession's more of a verbal promise, and it's not something physical that you can see or touch.」

Natsuki
「But a kiss... is us "giving form" to us being able to make contact as lovers. Kissing was what got me to feel like we were able to connect as lovers for the first time.」


Natsuki
「That's why that day's special to me. Because I felt like I was able to become lovers with you in the true meaning of the word
, Ryousuke

...」
％Ｂ
「Natsuki...」
Natsuki
「Ehehe. Anyway, let's eat. I don't want it to get cold after all the effort I put in.」

％Ｂ
「Right. I'll go get changed, then.」
Natsuki
「Mhm. I'll start serving the rice.」
％Ｂ
「Thanks.」
all
I didn't know that day was so special to Natsuki.
It kinda makes me happy.
Just remembering's getting my heart beating faster too.
I think things might get hot and heavy tonight...
d夏希_エッチシーン１０
Natsuki and I are looking at a photo album, still naked and up against each other after our especially passionate bout of sex.

It's the graduation album that Natsuki and the other grad-alb committee members created, filled with our memories of our high school days.

％Ｂ
「It's been five years since we graduated. Time sure flies... I feel like this past year since I graduated university's felt especially short.」


Natsuki
「Yeah, our perception of time's different from back then. It's only going to start passing quicker from now on. That's my experience.」


％Ｂ
「Really? Well, you've been out in the world for longer than I have, so I bet you're right.」


Natsuki
「Exactly. If there's anything you don't know, then feel free to ask me about anything. Just kidding, ehehe.」


She laughs and flips through the album.
The photos in the album are all ones taken by the grad-alb committee, of course.

％Ｂ
「Oh, you took this one, right?」
Natsuki
「Yeah, I did.」
％Ｂ
「And this one, and that one too.」
Natsuki
「Huh? Wow! How can you tell?」
％Ｂ
「It's not a big deal. It's so obvious all of these were taken by you.」

There's a certain feature present in all of the photos I pointed out.
％Ｂ
「They're all just filled with smiles. I can really tell just looking that everyone was having tons of fun.」

Natsuki
「Ehehe... It makes me happy to hear you say that.」
％Ｂ
「Though there are a few others that I doubt anyone other than you would've taken too.」

Natsuki
「Huh? Which ones?」
％Ｂ
「Here, like this one. You're the only one who'd take photos of Ousaka or Okihara-senpai like this.」

Natsuki
「Oh... Right. That's a good point.」
％Ｂ
「This one's from the Tanabata Festival, right?」
Natsuki
「Mhm, yeah. I just wanted to have this one in the album no matter what. I guess it's a bit of a personal bias.」

％Ｂ
「I think it's fine. Senpai's and Ousaka's displays were really popular that year anyway.」


％Ｂ
「I doubt the rest of the committee had any issues with it considering those moments are a part of our memories of our second-year Tanabata Festival.」

Natsuki
「That's true... but that's not the only reason why.」
％Ｂ
「Hm?」
Natsuki
「Because this photo shows a very precious time for me personally.」

％Ｂ
「A very precious time?」
Natsuki
「We're only the way we are now because you were in the event committee, I was in the grad-alb committee, and we had the Tanabata Festival between us, right?」


Natsuki
「I don't think it'd be exaggerating to say that the time we spent back then decided our futures.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah... You're right.」
Natsuki
「And I was able to take a good, hard look at how I felt about photography thanks to that time too.」


Natsuki
「That's why I just had to preserve that precious time I spent.」

She smiles and turns the page.
％Ｂ
「These are photos of club activities. This is from back when Minami hit that comeback home run when the bases were loaded, right?」

Natsuki
「That's right. I remember I had you come all the way to school on the weekend to help me.」

％Ｂ
「...This photo of the flutes playing in the concert band's pretty questionable-looking with the armpits showing and all...」

Natsuki
「I took this one right after I met you for the first time.」
％Ｂ
「You mean after you fell down the stairs?」
Natsuki
「Yep. The day you groped me out of nowhere.」
％Ｂ
「I didn't grope you. I just touched you by accident. If groping's what you want... That's more like this.」

Natsuki
「Hyan! Aah, nnh! Hey, no messing around! We're reminiscing on good times right now!」

％Ｂ
「Right, good point. Uhh, oh, this one! You seriously added that one you took of me right after I transferred in, huh.」


Natsuki
「Of cooourse I did. Everyone else has photos of their first day at school too.」

She looks happy.
The graduation album's a great photo album, filled with the heart and soul of the grad-alb committee.

But─
If I have one complaint, it'd be that there are almost no photos at all of the members of the grad-alb committee themselves, including Natsuki.

In fact, there aren't any photos of Natsuki.
I know there might not have been any way of getting around that, but it still makes me a little sad.

No... I shouldn't say that.
The members of the grad-alb committee have their own satisfaction and pride from creating this album.

％Ｂ
「Oh, these are from the graduation ceremony.」
Natsuki
「This takes me back. I remember Marika was crying the entire way through.」

％Ｂ
「I wonder how she's doing. I haven't talked to her lately.」

Natsuki
「She's doing fine. We talk every now and then over LIME. I talk to Rikka on it too.」


％Ｂ
「Oh, really?」
Girls really forge strong bonds, don't they.
Natsuki turns another page.
The last two pages are blank.
％Ｂ
「I've always wondered... Why are the last few pages of the graduation album blank?」

Natsuki
「It's this way because of a suggestion I made.」
％Ｂ
「Hm? A suggestion you made? I've never heard you talk about this before.」
Natsuki
「There should've been some paper placed between these pages here. You didn't see it?」

％Ｂ
「No... I didn't...」
Natsuki
「Well, I guess it might not matter if you didn't. It's about time anyway.」

％Ｂ
「About time...?」
Natsuki
「Yeah. For a class reunion.」
％Ｂ
「A class reunion? ...That's pretty sudden.」
Natsuki
「Did you really think this graduation album was just for reminiscing?」

％Ｂ
「Isn't that what they're usually for...?」
Natsuki
「This album's for connecting together good memories. These last few pages are blank so we can paste in new memories.」


New memories...
％Ｂ
「And that's gonna be from the class reunion?」
Natsuki
「Pretty much everyone should be making their way into the world at this point, right? Don't you think it's just the right time to do it?」

％Ｂ
「Good point... It might be around time for people to wanna vent about a few things now that they've experienced a few things as working adults.」

Natsuki
「Actually, I've already been talking with Marika and the others along those lines.」
％Ｂ
「What? You guys vent to each other?」
Natsuki
「No. I meant we were talking about a class reunion. They've been talking about how we should all get together again sometime too.」


％Ｂ
「So that's why we want a class reunion... But that sounds like it'd be a lot of work to organize. You probably won't really have the time to put together plans for anything like that, right?」

Natsuki
「What are you talking about? We know someone who's good at stuff like that, remember? Like a certain chairman of the event organization committee.」


She grins.
It's the same nostalgic smile from back when she was in the grad-alb committee.
％Ｂ
「I get it. Shuuichi. Yeah, he'd be great for that. But wait a second. He's got a job now, doesn't he?」

Natsuki
「No worries! I asked Marika, and he's apparently pretty into the idea. He was apparently like, "Leave it all to me!"」


％Ｂ
「An event committee revival, eh? I'll need to do something too.」

Natsuki
「I think you can just help with anything that comes up. You can just let Nirasawa handle things in general.」

％Ｂ
「You think so? But I really do wanna do something.」

Natsuki
「Is it stirring your instincts as an ex-event committee member?」
％Ｂ
「Pretty much. 'Cause those days really were a lot of fun.」

Natsuki
「More than now?」
％Ｂ
「I'm happy now.」
Natsuki
「─Mhm♪」
We kiss, as if to give form to our happiness.
