「...Huh. She's not here.」
I don't see Yukimura.
I'm panning my gaze over class E, but I don't spot her trademark uniform.

％Ｂ
「Hey, can I ask you something? You know where Yukimura is?」

Female Student C
「Yukimura-san? I haven't seen her all day today.」
％Ｂ
「Huh?」
Female Student C
「Maybe she isn't here today? She disappears every now and then, but she's usually at least at school, though.」

％Ｂ
「...All right. Thanks.」

％Ｂ
「...No response.」
_smh_st_04
...Well, nothing I can do about that. Guess I'll just have to try again some other day.
I head to the old school building during lunch break.
Though there's no point in coming here if Yukimura isn't at school today...

％Ｂ
「Wait... It's open?」
I push against the door, and it doesn't seem locked.
So does that mean... Yukimura's inside?
Touko
「Zzz... Zzz...」
％Ｂ
「...She's sleeping.」
Yukimura's familiar sleeping face. It's the same as ever.
Are my feelings... the only things that have changed?
I want to know how Yukimura feels about me.
How important of an existence am I within this girl's heart?

My heart rate climbs.
A tingling, sweet pain runs through me. It's like my heart's being constricted.
Touko
「Nh, nnh... Zzz...」
I want to move forward, but I also feel like I want to keep our current, comfortable relationship.\n \n\r
I'm torn between wanting to just watch her peaceful sleeping face, and talking to her so I can learn how she feels.

％Ｂ
「...What am I supposed to do about this?」
I don't know what to do with how I feel.
Yukimura's breathing sounds through the quiet of the old school building. It feels like holy ground here. Like I'm not permitted to disturb her slumber.

Touko
「Nnh... nh...?」
％Ｂ
「Oh... You're awake?」
Touko
「Fuaah...gh, nnhh... Morniiing...」
％Ｂ
「Morning, she says... You know it's lunchtime, right?」
Touko
「I knooow... I was just getting hungryyy...」
％Ｂ
「I heard you haven't been in class all day today. You've been here the whole time?」

Touko
「Mmm... I got here a little while agooo...」
％Ｂ
「A little while ago? So you mean... you got to school a bit before lunch?」
Touko
「I overslept... Thought I might as well not go to morning classes after that... I'm only here for something after school anyway, sooo...」

％Ｂ
「...Hm? For something after school?」
Touko
「And I overslept... because of you too...」
％Ｂ
「Wha?」
Touko
「Zzz... Zzz...」
...She's asleep again.
She has something to do after school. She overslept because of me.
This is... about yesterday, isn't it?
So does that mean Yukimura's thinking about me...?
Touko
「...」
...Is she awake?
She's just pretending to sleep.
％Ｂ
「Yukimura. You're awake, right?」
Touko
「...」
％Ｂ
「No point in pretending to be asleep. I just saw you look at me.」

Touko
「...Morning.」
％Ｂ
「Morning.」
Touko
「...Aren't you cheating? You're supposed to come after school.」
％Ｂ
「I'm here because... you weren't in your classroom. You didn't pick up when I called you either, but I thought you might be here, so...」


Touko
「...」
％Ｂ
「I'm here to continue where we left off yesterday. I'm not giving up until you get that I'm serious.」

Touko
「...What am I supposed to do about that?」
％Ｂ
「And what am I supposed to do if I don't get a response from you? We're both bothered by this.」
Touko
「...I'm more bothered.」
％Ｂ
「Could you get up at least? It's hard to talk to you like this.」

Touko
「You say you want to continue from yesterday, but... I don't think my answer's going to change.」

％Ｂ
「I came to change it. Could you give me some time to do that? Let's go on a date.」

Touko
「...Excuse me?」
％Ｂ
「I thought for a long time after yesterday... about what I should to do get you to understand how I feel. So let's go on a date.」

Touko
「W-Wait a second! What do you mean, go on a date...!?」
％Ｂ
「All we do is talk here, right? We went home together just once, but that wasn't really a date. I wanna go on a proper date with you.」


Touko
「It-It's not like that would be any different...! We'd be doing pretty much the same thing...!」

％Ｂ
「Then let's try it out. If I can't change how you feel that way, then I guess nothing can.」

Touko
「Hgh... B-But...!」
％Ｂ
「Give me a chance. I want you to understand that my feelings are the real deal.」

I look right at her and tell her what I want to do.
If I can somehow get Yukimura to look my way with this... then I'm sure I have a chance.

Touko
「...Mmm, what should I do. A chance, huh...」
It's a simple yes or no.
But it feels like Yukimura's considering a different option altogether.
Touko
「I might not give you an answer right away, you know.」
％Ｂ
「You mean you'll want time to think?」
Touko
「Pretty much. I don't know how long that might be, though.」
％Ｂ
「Sure. I don't mind.」
It's way better than a "No."
As long as there's another opportunity, I still have a chance to turn the tables.
Touko
「Let's do this, then. If you can convince me, then I'll consider both you and the event committee. How's that?」

％Ｂ
「Great! So I was thinking tomorrow...」
Touko
「Let's go now. You said you were thinking for a long time yesterday, right?」
％Ｂ
「I'm sorry!? N-Now!? What about afternoon classes!?」
Touko
「Just skip!」
％Ｂ
「...」
Yukimura might change her mind if I wait.
Then fine. I know I shouldn't, but...!
％Ｂ
「...Okay. Let's go now. I'll go get my bag.」
Touko
「Mm, okaaay. I'll be waiting here.」
％Ｂ
「I'll be back right away, all right!? You better not leave!」
Touko
「I dunnooo... I might go home if you take too long.」
％Ｂ
「Gh... I'll sprint!」
％Ｂ
「Hahh... Hahh...!」
Natsuki
「Agh!? Y-You scared me! What are you in such a hurry for!?」

％Ｂ
「Sorry. I'm skipping class for the afternoon. Cover for me.」
Natsuki
「Excuse me!? What are you saying!?」
％Ｂ
「This is the moment for me. I'm gonna use your advice to the fullest and do my best.」

Natsuki
「The moment... Oh, I get it. I guess I'll have to help you out too, then!」

all
I swiftly get my stuff together.
I meet gazes with Narusawa as I'm doing so.
％Ｂ
「I might end up causing trouble for you, Narusawa, but please.」
Rikka
「...Could I ask you to do something for me while you're at it?」
％Ｂ
「Hm? Do what?」
Rikka
「Tell her to stop calling me by that name. It's embarrassing.」

％Ｂ
「...All right. Got it, Piano-chan.」
Rikka
「Wha...!? Even you
, Hino-kun

...!?」
％Ｂ
「Haha, my bad. I'll tell her to rethink your nickname if things go well.」

Rikka
「...Okay. I hope things go well.」
It's not just these two.
Shinozaki and Ousaka have helped me out too.
There's no way I can let this opportunity slip by.
Natsuki
「We'll handle the rest! Do your best out there, man!」

％Ｂ
「...Yeah!」
all
Touko
「So... what are we going to do?」
％Ｂ
「How about we eat something first? I bet you're hungry too, since we left during lunch break.」

Touko
「That's true. Nothing's really fun on an empty stomach.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, right. I was talking to Narusawa before I left. She wanted me to tell you, "Stop calling me Piano-chan."」

Touko
「Whaaat? I think it's easy to understand. And it's cute.」
％Ｂ
「I think so too, but she doesn't like it herself, you know.」
Now that I think about it... Yukimura doesn't have a nickname for me, does she?
And I've also never actually seen her call anyone by their names.
％Ｂ
「I've never heard you call anyone by name, come to think of it.」
Touko
「What? Why bring this up?」
％Ｂ
「You always call people by nicknames... Is there a reason for that?」
Touko
「Mmm... Just feel like it. It's easier to remember nicknames.」
％Ｂ
「So then why don't I have one?」
Touko
「You're pretty much the only boy I talk to. There's no reason for me to have a nickname for you, is there?」

％Ｂ
「...O-Oh, okay.」
I'm the only guy she talks to. I feel pretty smug about that.
I stumble over my words as happiness and embarrassment well up within me.
％Ｂ
「Then maybe you could call me by my name...」
Touko
「Caaan't do that.」
％Ｂ
「Wh-Why?」
Touko
「Why indeed? Okaaay, that's enough of this conversation. The sun's going to go down if you don't start our date soon. Do you want me to go home?」


％Ｂ
「W-Wait a second! Let's get food first! Then we'll start!」

The days are longer now that it's summer, but I'm pretty sure the time's going to pass really quickly.

Let's eat quickly and get started on our date.
all
％Ｂ
「Let's get something simple... Oh, how about burgers?」
Touko
「Okay, sure. I want mine without pickles.」
％Ｂ
「Got it. I'll go buy them, so wait here. I'll pay for today, in return for those crêpes the other day.」

all
％Ｂ
「Yukimura, I'm... Wait, what?」
I've returned with the burgers, but Yukimura isn't here.
I look around, and spot her crouching by the roadside.
Touko
「Here, come heeere. I'm not scaryyy.」
％Ｂ
「...What are you doing?」
Touko
「Hm? I saw a stray cat, so I wanted to pet him.」
I wish she wouldn't do this. Her disappearing suddenly scared me...

Yukimura and I watch the stray cat as he moves on his way.
Touko
「Mmm... I wonder if he's wary of me. He won't come close.」
％Ｂ
「That's just how cats are, aren't they? They'll run away if you try to go up to them yourself.」

I once again think about how catlike Yukimura is.
She's carefree, doesn't take to people easily... and comes across as somewhat removed from everything.
％Ｂ
「...Maybe the fact you're so similar makes it even worse?」
Touko
「What the heck? Oh, he's coming! Looook, I have tasty meeeat!」

She holds out food to the cat.
It looks like she's started carrying around jerky for stray cats, like she said she'd do.

Touko
「Ehehe, good boy... That black coat sure looks hot.」
The cat lets her pet him. 
Looks like it's okay to pet him while he's eating.
Touko
「Cats sure are cute.」
％Ｂ
「Y-Yeah. They are.」
Touko
「You guys have it so nice. There's nothing holding you down.」
She speaks tenderly and enviously.
There seem to be several different emotions behind her eyes as she pets the black cat.

Touko
「Oh...!」
The cat dextrously slips through Yukimura's hands with the jerky still in his mouth.

He disappears from sight without so much as a backward glance.
％Ｂ
「Guess they don't really love you just from getting food.」
Touko
「That's why they're cute. He was a smart-looking, cool one.」

％Ｂ
「It's a shame he ran away after you got him to come up to you and everything.」
Touko
「They don't let their guard down easily, which makes me wanna do lots for them. Maybe he did it on purpose?」


She works hard to try to get them to understand her affections because they don't show how they feel that easily.

...Just like I'm trying to do with her.
Touko
「...It's because the relationship gets more involved when I call them by name.」
％Ｂ
「Huh?」
Touko
「It's the answer to your question earlier. That kinda stuff's a problem. It just makes things painful when you have to say goodbye, don't you think?」

％Ｂ
「Why'd you tell me? You said it was just because you felt like it earlier.」

Touko
「...I just felt like it.」
She hides her feelings, and then reveals them... She has an elusive personality.
I might be able to get closer with her if I learn to enjoy these little exchanges more.

Touko
「Anyway, where are you going to take me now?」
％Ｂ
「Right. It's a bit of a walk... That fine with you?」
Touko
「I don't mind. I don't hate walking, and I'm leaving everything to you today.」

Let's walk while we eat our burgers.
We're currently headed to... my favorite place in all of Shionagi.
Touko
「So this place... is an aquarium. I've only seen it from far away.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. This is a place with good memories for me. You remember Okihara-senpai, from when we went camping? Her dad was the director here.」


Touko
「Huh, really. She did know a lot about fish, after all.」
％Ｂ
「It's crazy, right? I think she might be on par with Ousaka's knowledge about stars.」
Touko
「She's really pretty, and has big boobs too. That explains the really rich-daughter feel I got from her.」

...I dunno if the boobs have anything to do with that.
Let's just ignore that. I feel like commenting on it would just make things troublesome.

％Ｂ
「It's a real shame this place closed down.」
Touko
「I wonder why it closed down. The building's still so cool and pretty.」

％Ｂ
「Oh, you think Marinpia's great too!?」
Touko
「Mmm... I don't know if I think it's great, but I think it's cool. Like how it doesn't look like an aquarium.」

％Ｂ
「Right!? Oh man, I'm so glad you get it! This design's just so good, isn't it!?」

Touko
「...What's with you? You're so excited all of a sudden.」
％Ｂ
「I'm happy. Doesn't it make you happy when other people like what you like?」

Touko
「...Mm, I guess.」
％Ｂ
「You like going on walks and exploring too, right? Doesn't it make you happy when other people like that too?」

Touko
「Mmm... I don't really know. I don't know if I like it... It's more like I've just always been wandering around by myself.」

％Ｂ
「Wha?」
Touko
「Besides, that time you came with me was the first time I've ever wandered around with someone else. I don't really know if it made me happy or not.」


％Ｂ
「...I'll rephrase the question, then. Were you enjoying yourself back then?」

She was smiling the whole time she was dragging me around.
She also said messing with me was "the most fun she's had since coming to Shionagi."
％Ｂ
「I want you to know more about me... but I want to know about you just as much.」

Touko
「...」
％Ｂ
「If you're having fun, then I'm happy. So I wanna hear about how you felt.」

Touko
「...No idea. It was a long time ago, so I forgot.」
％Ｂ
「A long... It was just a week ago.」
Touko
「It was still a long time ago. I try not to remember things like that.」

％Ｂ
「...I see. Okay, then I'll make some memories for us together. Let's take a photo, Yukimura.」

Touko
「Huh? A photo... Ah, hey!」
I step away from Yukimura and point my phone's camera lens at her.
She looks flustered on the screen.
％Ｂ
「Mhm, around there's good. Look this way for me.」
Touko
「I-I'm not okay with this...! You can't just say you're taking a photo and...!」
％Ｂ
「Don't worry, it'll be fine. We can retake it as many times as we want. Come on, smile!」

Touko
「That's not the issue here! There's nothing interesting about taking a photo of me, is there!?」

％Ｂ
「That's not true. I don't have any photos of you.」
I do actually have the one I got from Segawa, but I'm gonna keep that a secret from Yukimura.
I want one with a more natural smile... her usual smile.
％Ｂ
「It's to commemorate. Gotta make sure we have a keepsake for a certain someone who instantly forgets stuff from a long time ago.」

Touko
「...You're really mean sometimes, you know that?」
％Ｂ
「Oh, I like that face.」
__photo_tk0620_01
Touko
「Ah!? Hey, that wasn't okay! You told me to smile!」

％Ｂ
「I kinda liked your angry face too. The more keepsakes the better, right?」

Touko
「...I hope you know I'm never smiling now.」
__photo_tk0620_02
Touko
「Agh, you took another one!?」
％Ｂ
「Sorry, sorry! My bad! I just took it on reflex 'cause I never get to see you make that kinda face!」


Touko
「...I wish you wouldn't act like I was a rare animal or something.」
％Ｂ
「I'll send you the photos later. Let's take a proper commemorative photo.」

Touko
「I don't... really need it. There's no point in having photos of myself, is there?」

％Ｂ
「Don't be that way. Segawa's gonna yell at you if you make light of photos, you know. Besides, didn't you say you'd leave everything up to me today?」

Touko
「...Just one more, okay?」
％Ｂ
「Could you smile a bit, Yukimura...?」
Touko
「Nope. This is payback for you being mean.」
...This is cute in its own way.
But I still want a proper smile for the commemorative photo.
％Ｂ
「Oh, a cat.」
Touko
「What? Where!?」
She looks away from me for a moment.
I take the opportunity to prepare... and put on a masterpiece of a funny face!
Touko
「I don't see it anywheeere... Hey, where did you... Pff... Ahahahah! What the heck! What are you, stupid!? Ahahahahah!」


％Ｂ
「There we go. Thanks for the smile.」
__photo_tk0620_03
Touko
「Ah, that's not fair! But... Ahahah! Ahh... It was funny, so whatever.」

％Ｂ
「See, there's a good smile. Now we've got a good keepsake for today.」

Touko
「...You better delete the two before that one.」
％Ｂ
「I will not. Those were good photos too.」
Touko
「Th-They're embarrassing! They just make me look mean!」
％Ｂ
「You wanna take a photo too? You remember how to do it, right?」

Touko
「I do, but... what would I take a photo of?」
％Ｂ
「Me.」
Touko
「Mmm... I don't really want one.」
...She's apparently not interested.
I wanted her to follow my lead and take a photo there...
Touko
「There!」
％Ｂ
「...Wha?」
Touko
「Ahahah! You looked so depressed! You make pretty cute faces when you get like that!」

O-Oh no...!
I can't believe I was caught by surprise so easily...!
Touko
「How's that! That's payback! Oh, I'm gonna send this to everyone.」
％Ｂ
「Wha, wait, wait! That's not fair! Wait, I remember now! You better have deleted that photo from before too!」


Touko
「You're the one who said we should take photos to commemorate, right? So we shouldn't delete photos, riiight?」

％Ｂ
「Agh, wait! Then at least retake it with me making a better face!」
all
We walked around all over the place.
And to close off the date, we're walking along the seaside park.
Touko
「Nnnh...! The wind sure feels nice!」
％Ｂ
「Hey, Yukimura. How was today?」
Touko
「Mmm... How do I answer that? I don't really know.」
％Ｂ
「...Uh.」
Touko
「I don't really know how it was as a date, but I do think it was fun. I think I could feel how hard you were trying.」

％Ｂ
「...I see.」
But that also means it could've been better.
To be honest, I can't help but feel I wasn't prepared enough for our date today.
％Ｂ
「Then I wanna go into overtime. I'll prepare a little more, so let's go on another date.」

Touko
「...」
％Ｂ
「Could I ask you to hang out with me... until you have a clear answer?」
Touko
「...If I feel like it.」
Yukimura told me why she doesn't call people by name today.
I understand her reasoning, but I can't help but feel like she's using "It makes goodbyes painful" as an excuse.

％Ｂ
「...It's just not a good thing.」
There's no way that being alone's for the better.
I'm sure Yukimura's forcing herself.
But then how do I open up her stubborn heart?
That question's at the heart of my worries.
％Ｂ
「Hmm... I guess I'll just have to take it one step at a time.」
It's like approaching a particularly wary cat.
I wonder if all I can do is just wait patiently for her to take interest in me.

I want to open up her heart somehow.
If only there were something to get me started...
％Ｂ
「...Hm?」
Something knocks against my pinky.
It's the vial of star sand I got from Ousaka.
Something to make wishes come true...
％Ｂ
「...I think I'll give myself an ace in the hole.」
【％Ｂ】「I've got a favor to #Nask. You free tomorrow?」
【Marika】「I don't have any plans. #NWhat is it?」
【％Ｂ】「Could you come shopping #Nwith me? I want your #Nhelp picking out a #Npresent.」
【Marika】_st_0109
【Marika】「Meet up in the #Nmarketplace?」
【％Ｂ】「Got it. Sorry about #Nthis, and thanks.」
【Marika】「Don't worry about it, #Nokay?」
【Marika】「I want to help.」
【％Ｂ】「I really appreciate it.」
【％Ｂ】「Let's meet on the main #Nstreet tomorrow, then.」
【％Ｂ】_st_0310
【Marika】_st_0105
I'm so grateful for Shinozaki's kindness.
...I hope I can find something good tomorrow.
