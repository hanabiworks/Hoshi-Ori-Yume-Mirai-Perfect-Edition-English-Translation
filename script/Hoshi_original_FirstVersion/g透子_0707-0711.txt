「...Ngah, gh...!?」
Wh-What's going on!?
There's something on top of my stomach!?
Touko
「Nnh... mnyah... ehehe...」
％Ｂ
「Uhh... Agh!? You're kidding me!」
I don't need to make lunch today because we're only taking exams.
I set the alarm clock taking that into account... but we're already almost late.

％Ｂ
「Why didn't it go off!? We need to change into our uniforms... Aaagh!? Right, our uniforms!」

How the hell's Touko gonna go to school today!?
If she goes home first before going to school, she's totally gonna be late! Forget that, she'll miss her entire first exam!

％Ｂ
「Touko, wake up, we're in trouble! We woke up late!」
Touko
「Nnnhh...! What time is iiit...?」
％Ｂ
「It's eight! My alarm didn't ring!」
Touko
「...It diiid. I stopped it...」
％Ｂ
「This is your fault!? Wake up, we gotta leave the house...! We have exams today! We can't be late!」

Touko
「It's fiiine... I have my uniform...」
％Ｂ
「Oh, you do? We should be able to make it in time, then!」
Touko
「I brought it in case you wanted to do it with me wearing my unifooorm... I'm glad I came prepaaared...」

...So that's what she was talking about last night.
So then... what was she planning on doing if I said I wanted to do that and we ended up getting it dirty?

％Ｂ
「Hurry up and change and come down, all right!? Breakfast's... out of the question now, but I'll at least make some coffee!」

Touko
「Ehehe, thaaanks. You're so niiice... Mnyah...」
all
％Ｂ
「Hahh... hahh... I-I made it...!」
Rikka
「You were almost late again today. Did you oversleep?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah... I guess we studied a little too hard yesterday.」

Rikka
「I see, so you should be fine for your exams, then. Yukimura-san was studying with you, wasn't she?」

％Ｂ
「...Probably. Touko was doing her best I think... but I dunno how it'll go.」

Rikka
「You're too soft on Yukimura-san to be counted on.」
％Ｂ
「I-I... don't think that's true?」
I can't quite just deny the statement.
Yeah, I just can't help but spoil her...
Natsuki
「Morning there, chef. That photo last night was pretty nice.」

％Ｂ
「...Shut up. We're not talking about that.」
Natsuki
「You end up almost being late 'cause you were making her breakfast or something? I hope you're not cutting it this close because you were being all lovey-dovey with Touko right from the start of the day.」


％Ｂ
「We weren't! I seriously overslept today!」
Natsuki
「Hmm... Today, is it? Then how about yesterday?」

Rikka
「...You said you were studying for exams yesterday, didn't you?」

Natsuki
「What are you talking about, Rikka? He even made her dinner last night. There's no way they were just sitting there studying.」

％Ｂ
「We seriously were! We weren't completely focused the whole time of course, but still!」

Rikka
「...I wonder.」
％Ｂ
「I was actually planning on waking up early to help Touko with some last-minute studying! I didn't wake up 'cause she turned my alarm off!」


Natsuki
「What? How'd Touko turn off your alarm clock?」

％Ｂ
「...Uh.」
...Crap.
I just dug my own grave!
Natsuki
「Did you hear that just now, Narusawa-san? She apparently stayed the night the day before a test!」

Rikka
「...I'm looking forward to your exam scores.」
％Ｂ
「We seriously didn't do anything! We studied! Stop with those cold eyes, Narusawaaa!」

％Ｂ
「Siiigh～ ...We're finally done～!」
Touko
「It's been a while since we came here. Nnnh, it's always so relaxing.」

We steep ourselves in the sense of liberation after finally finishing all of our exams.

The old school building's smell is nostalgic, just like Touko says.
Maybe it's because I've been coming here almost every day, but this smell just puts me at ease right away.

Touko
「Hey, hurry and sit down.」
％Ｂ
「What? What's this about?」
Touko
「Don't worry, don't worry. Could you hurry and sit here?」
all
Touko
「Ehehe, it's been so looong.」
％Ｂ
「You sure love doing this.」
Touko
「And you like it when I do this, don't you
, Ryousuke-kun

?」
Touko
「I can feel... how your heart beats faster.」
I can't really stop my heart rate from picking up, and it's only exacerbated by how long it's been.

Yeah... Guess I can't hide it if we're this close to each other.
Touko
「Nnnh～ I tried so hard～! I think I might've done the best I've ever done on exams this time around.」

％Ｂ
「Really, that's great. You should be grateful to Shinozaki and Segawa, and Okihara-senpai too.」

Touko
「...Mhm. I'm grateful for everyone.」
She clings onto me.
I gently pet her head in response, and she smiles up at me.
Touko
「Let's go somewhere, okay? We had to study last week, so I wanna go play.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, I've been at home this whole time for exam prep too. Where should we... Oh.」

Touko
「Mm? What's wrong?」
％Ｂ
「Let's go to the pool, Touko.」
Touko
「What? The pool?」
％Ｂ
「We said we'd do it before. It's a good opportunity, so wanna go?」
Touko
「Mmm... Pool, the pool... You mean the Shionagi Park pool, right?」

％Ｂ
「Yeah. You ever been there?」
Touko
「No, I haven't. I've never actually gone to play at a pool before.」
％Ｂ
「Wha, seriously!? Wait... Is it because you can't swim or something?」
Touko
「Of course not. I wouldn't jump into a pool if I couldn't swim, would I?」

...She has a point.
Though normally you wouldn't jump into a pool while wearing your school uniform at all.
Touko
「I see, I see. So you wanna see me in a swimsuit that badly? I'll have to be careful you don't get too excited and attack me.」

％Ｂ
「Th-That's... not entirely untrue, but! It's not like that's all I'm thinking about, all right!?」

Touko
「Ahahah! Okaaay. I got yelled at.」
％Ｂ
「Of course... And I'm just happy in general having fun with you.」

Touko
「Ehehe, thanks. It makes me a little happy... that you get angry at me like that. Maybe that's why I mess with you.」


％Ｂ
「...I'd be happy if you could hold back just a bit.」
I gently wrap my arms around her, and she smiles.
She's probably fully aware of how much I dote on her.
Touko
「I'm so excited for tomorrow.」
