「Hmm...」
My pen glides across the white sketchbook paper.
I'm drawing out some conceptual sketches for the "starry night aquarium."
I've decided to try to make a concrete drawing out of the ideas that Okihara-senpai and Ousaka came up with yesterday, and what I'd imagine an aquarium to be like.


％Ｂ
「Maybe like this?」
I'm drawing it out because I'm going to be presenting it at the next event committee meeting.

It'd be one thing if we were just hanging up drawings or photos, but even a small-scale aquarium would cost money for electricity and water.

We'd need permission from the academy too, of course, and for that, we'd need approval from the event committee.

％Ｂ
「Hmm...? Maybe not...」
Rikka
「...」
I've already talked to Shuuichi about it. He says it'll all be up to how this presentation goes.

If I want the presentation to go well, then I'll need anyone and everyone to be interested in the idea.

This sketch is going to be a weapon for that purpose.
Having an actual visual would be a lot better than trying to explain it with just words.\n\r

Using tactics like this is a matter of course in the world of architecture.
％Ｂ
「All right... How about that?」
Well, it's just based off of secondhand knowledge from books and what I've heard from the head of where I worked before.

But I need to make sure this presentation's a success, for Okihara-senpai and Ousaka's sakes!

％Ｂ
「Hmm... It's still not really right...」
Rikka
「...Hey... Can I get your attention for a second?」
％Ｂ
「Hm... What is it, Narusawa?」
Rikka
「Just so you know, we're moving to a different room for our next class.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah... And?」
Rikka
「Everyone else left already, so it's just you and me left here... You know that, right?」

％Ｂ
「Uh...」
all
I look around. All of my classmates are gone.

％Ｂ
「Welp... When did that happen?」
Rikka
「I'm going too... Don't be late.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, got it. Thanks for letting me know.」
Rikka
「...」
％Ｂ
「Hmm... Maybe I should emphasize the constellations a bit more?」
Rikka
「Sigh... You're definitely going to be late.」
％Ｂ
「Huh? You say something?」
Rikka
「What are you so engrossed in drawing for?」
％Ｂ
「Oh, this? I'm gonna use this drawing in a presentation for the next event committee meeting.」
Rikka
「...Couldn't you be a little more specific?」
％Ｂ
「Oh, uhh...」
all
I explain the details of the situation to her.
Rikka
「A starry night aquarium... So that's supposed to be the concept art for that. You're actually pretty good at drawing.」

％Ｂ
「You think so? Thanks.」
Rikka
「But you ended up with focusing on just one thing in the end? You were so set on trying to get both the astronomy and naturalist clubs to succeed at first.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah... That's how things ended up. We owe Ousaka big time. Same for you, Narusawa.」


Rikka
「What? ...Wh-Why me?」
％Ｂ
「You gave me advice too, didn't you?」
Rikka
「O-Oh... That... That wasn't really... what I'd call advice...」

％Ｂ
「But it was thanks to what you said that I wanted to get to know the two of them better... so I think it's still thanks to you that things ended up the way they did.」


Rikka
「S-Stop that... All I did was answer a question... Anyway, we need to hurry up and get going, or else we're really going to be late.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, I know.」
Rikka
「You didn't move a muscle when you said that earlier. I'm really going to go without you now.」

all
She then quickly walks out from the classroom.
％Ｂ
「She got pretty mad at me...」
I ended up getting lectured pretty harshly, even though I was only a minute late.
I should've just listened to Narusawa.
％Ｂ
「Well, that aside...」
After school.
I walk into the old school building.
The entrance was open, so Yukimura should be here too.
％Ｂ
「I should talk to the owner of this place too...」
Touko
「...Zzz... Zzz...」
％Ｂ
「...」
A pool of sunlight shines in through the window.
Yukimura's sleeping on top of a row of chairs in the middle of the sunlight.

％Ｂ
「Ahem... Hey... Yukimura?」
Touko
「...Nnh...」
She wakes up immediately and sits up.
Touko
「Nnnhh... What?」
She looks a little miffed that I woke her up.
％Ｂ
「Sorry for waking you up. There's something I wanted to ask you about.」
Touko
「...Do you want advice again?」
％Ｂ
「Well, it's more like... I figured it'd be a good idea to get permission from the owner of the old school building.」

Touko
「Owner? ...Do you mean me?」
％Ｂ
「Uhh... Wait... Maybe the ruler of the old school building? The king of the old school building?」
Touko
「I'm not commenting on what you called me... Fuaaahh... Affhh... So permission? For what?」

％Ｂ
「I wanted to draw a sketch.」
Touko
「A sketch? You mean like, a drawing? I don't remember you saying you were in the art club.」

％Ｂ
「No, I'm not, but...」
all
I decide I might as well explain things to Yukimura the way I did to Narusawa.
Touko
「...A starry night aquarium... huh.」
％Ｂ
「And so I'm drawing a sketch for an event committee presentation, but I just can't really get what I want out of it.」

％Ｂ
「Part of it's the fact that I can't really do anything about how a classroom's just really different from both starry nights and aquariums.」

％Ｂ
「So I had an idea. I thought maybe the classrooms in this old building might be closer to what I'm imagining.」

Touko
「And so that's why you came here to sketch. I don't really think you need to get my permission for every little thing like that, you know.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, well, that might be true... but you know.」
Touko
「Just go for it. I don't really―」
Touko
「Hm. Wait a second. You're not going to try to use this building for the Tanabata Festival too, are you?」


％Ｂ
「No need to worry about that. This building's off limits, so I couldn't get the permission to use it anyway.」


％Ｂ
「And I doubt there's water and electricity here either.」
Touko
「There is.」
％Ｂ
「Huh? Really?」
Touko
「To be specific, it's set up so you can use them at any time by using the switchboard and opening the water valves. I know where those are, too.」


％Ｂ
「...You really are the owner.」
Touko
「Well, as for me, I don't care what you do, as long as you don't get in the way of my peace and quiet here.」

％Ｂ
「I just wanna sketch something.」
Touko
「That so. Then feel free.」
all
She then lies back down on the chairs with her back facing me.

Well, now that I've gotten the owner's permission...
％Ｂ
「All right, then excuse me...」
I grab a nearby chair and start sketching.
％Ｂ
「...」
Yeah... The classrooms over here fit better with the feel.
I'm coming up with more and more ideas from experiencing this ambiance directly―

Touko
「...Hmm.」
％Ｂ
「Whoa!?」
I look up to see Yukimura suddenly right before my eyes.

％Ｂ
「Don't... Don't scare me like that!」
Touko
「You're pretty good.」
％Ｂ
「R-Right... I guess... Thanks.」
％Ｂ
「And I thought you were asleep.」
Touko
「It's hard to go back to sleep once I've been woken up once. That, and I can hear you sketching.」

％Ｂ
「S-Sorry about that. I'll leave after a bit more.」
Touko
「...I don't really care.」
all
She then just up and leaves.
％Ｂ
「Sigh... God, she scared me out of my skin...」
I resume sketching.
％Ｂ
「...」
All right... I think I'm almost done.
This is turning out better than I―
Touko
「Touch.」
％Ｂ
「Fhyaaahh!?」
I let out yet another strange scream in response to a sudden cold sensation against my neck.

Touko
「Ahahah! "Fhyaaahh"!」
％Ｂ
「Y-Yukimuraaa!」
I whip my head around. Just like I thought. Yukimura's standing there, cackling to herself, with a can of coffee in her hand.

Touko
「Sorry, sorry. Here, some refreshment.」
She holds out the coffee to me.
She's got another already-opened can in her other hand.
It looks like she bought this for me.
％Ｂ
「S-Sure... Thanks.」
Touko
「Hmm... I see...」
She peers at my sketchbook as she sips at her coffee.
％Ｂ
「...Something catch your eye?」
Touko
「Mmm... Not really.」
％Ｂ
「If there's something on your mind, then let me know.」
Touko
「Nope, no. It's not really something I should stick my nose into either.」
％Ｂ
「But you said lots of helpful stuff when I asked you for advice the other day.」

Touko
「That was because you asked me to. And I don't think I really said that much.」

％Ｂ
「Then would you do it again if I asked you to? It's about that starry night aquarium I was talking about earlier. Is there anything that you think we should―」


Touko
「W-Wait a second now. Why do you keep asking me? I told you before that I'm not relevant.」

％Ｂ
「We went camping together, though.」
Touko
「That again?」
％Ｂ
「I'm just trying to take advantage of how nice you are to try to get you to help me.」

Touko
「...You've suddenly become really honest.」
％Ｂ
「I figured that might be more effective with you.」
Touko
「...Well, I won't deny that.」
％Ｂ
「I really wanna get this plan to work for this year's Tanabata Festival. I'm gonna do everything I can for it. I don't want Okihara-senpai and Ousaka's feelings to go to waste.」


Touko
「Mmm... That kinda passion isn't really my thing... though... I guess stuff like that isn't so bad every now and then.」

％Ｂ
「Also, I think you'd probably get less of those clubs recruiting you if you were kinda vaguely helping us out.」

Touko
「Okay. If you really want me to, then I'll help you out at least a little.」

all
She grabs a chair and sits down right next to me.

Touko
「So I just need to complain about this sketch?」
％Ｂ
「No, not complaints. I want opinions... though I guess complaints are fine.」
Touko
「It's a starry night aquarium, right? I think the name's already something to consider.」

％Ｂ
「We're starting there?」
Touko
「'Cause the thing is―」
...She's pulled a 180, and now she's talking pretty seriously.
...That was kinda unexpected.
