After school.
Here I am in front of the astronomy clubroom again, to participate in the club's activities.
％Ｂ
「Excuse meee.」
Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「Oh, you waited for me today.」
％Ｂ
「All right. Let's head to the roof, then.」
Sora
「...*shake shake*」
％Ｂ
「What? We're not going to the roof?」
Sora
「...Weather's bad again today. Probably can't see anything.」
％Ｂ
「Oh... Yeah, it's been cloudy a lot lately. We gonna take today off, then?」

Sora
「...To the library.」
％Ｂ
「The library? What are you gonna do there?」
Sora
「...Borrow books.」
...Right. Duh.
Sora
「...You can go home
, Ryou

.」
％Ｂ
「Nah, I'll tag along. I wanna read some books about stars too.」

Sora
「...Really.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah.」
Ousaka and I both borrow armfuls of astronomy-related books from the library and walk to a first-year classroom. Ousaka's classroom.

％Ｂ
「Why aren't you reading in the library?」
Sora
「...Being alone is more comfortable for reading.」
I guess there were a few people at the library...
％Ｂ
「...Wait. Am I disturbing you by being here?」
Sora
「...」
Sora
「...No issues.」
all
She then starts reading one of the books she borrowed.
I really hope she didn't just say that to be polite. I sit down in a nearby chair and pick up one of the books I brought.

I just picked out a few random books on stars to read, but...

The title of my book is "A Field Guide for Japan's Constellations."
The spine of Ousaka's book reads "Wave Functions and Their Relevance to Multiverse Theory."
％Ｂ
「...」
I've never even heard of those terms before.
My photo-filled field guide's making me feel like a little kid in comparison...

No, I don't need to force myself to match the astronomy aficionado.
I'm still a beginner.
all
I shouldn't distract Ousaka from her reading when she's already focused. I look down at my own book.

Let's see. How to find the North Star.
First, find the Big Dipper─
Time for some reading.
％Ｂ
「...Zzz... Zzz... ngh...」
％Ｂ
「Nh... nnh... Aah...?」
％Ｂ
「Oh... Crap... I fell asleep...」
I had lain down on the desk and fallen asleep at some point.
Hope I didn't drool on my book or anything...
％Ｂ
「...Wait, what?」
I don't see Ousaka anywhere.
％Ｂ
「The heck did she go...?」
％Ｂ
「Wait, whoa!?」
Ousaka's suddenly sitting there in the seat next to me, staring at me.

Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「S-So you moved...」
And why's she next to me?
I feel like something like this happened just the other day too...
％Ｂ
「Sorry... I fell asleep.」
Sora
「...*shake shake*」
She's staring at me again...
She's staring really hard...
It's making me kinda nervous...
％Ｂ
「Uhh... Something up?」
Sora
「...Not really... Was just watching your face while you slept.」
％Ｂ
「O-Oh, okay... Did I look stupid? Did I drool or something?」

Sora
「...*shake shake*」
％Ｂ
「...That's a relief.」
So then why was she watching me sleep?
She's pretty weird...
all
％Ｂ
「Phew... Nnngh... I guess it's about time to leave?」
I stretch and look at the clock to try to hide my embarrassment and awkwardness.
％Ｂ
「Wanna start heading out?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
The eastern sky's already started to darken by the time we leave through the entranceway.
％Ｂ
「I wonder if now's about time we can see the first few stars.」
Sora
「...」
Ousaka silently points at the sky.
At a small, glittering star.
Sora
「...Evening Star.」
％Ｂ
「Ohh! It's Venus! The one you showed me yesterday, right?」

Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「So you can see it clearly even when it's this light out.」
Sora
「...You can see it even better once it's dark.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, I bet. I wish we could stay at school until night. We'd be able to see the stars properly with the telescope.」


Sora
「...You want to do that?」
％Ｂ
「Well... Yeah, I do. 'Cause now that I think about it, I've only ever looked through that telescope during the day or evening.」

％Ｂ
「That telescope's real nice, so I wanna look through it at night at least once. But they make us leave school once it's time.」


％Ｂ
「Is taking that telescope with us from school not okay?」
Sora
「...It's school property, so we're not allowed.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, figured.」
Sora
「...But we can request to extend our allotted time for club activities. Then we could stay until night.」

％Ｂ
「Huh, really?」
Sora
「...If you want to see
, Ryou

, then I can fill out a request tomorrow.」
％Ｂ
「I wanna see! Let's send it in tomorrow!」
Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「Oh man, this reminds me of when I went to a stargazing party back when I was a kid.」

Sora
「...」
I'm looking forward to tomorrow.
all
I'm checking tomorrow's weather on my phone before I go to sleep.
％Ｂ
「The weather in Shionagi tomorrow is... perfectly clear. "The clouds will clear up tonight, which should let one see the stars very clearly." That's perfect.」


％Ｂ
「Oh... That's LIME.」
Looks like someone's sent me a message.
％Ｂ
「...Ousaka?」
【Sora】「Bear in the north.」
【Sora】_st_0301
％Ｂ
「Bear in the north... The heck? Is this code or something?」

She's probably trying to tell me to look to the north...
％Ｂ
「Which way's north anyway? Let's see...」
I start up my phone's compass app and see which way north is.
％Ｂ
「This way.」
I open my north-facing window and look outside.
％Ｂ
「...What bear?」
All I see is the house on the other side of the street.
％Ｂ
「But she had to mean something by it if she went through the trouble of sending a message...」

I glance up. The stars glitter overhead.
％Ｂ
「...Is she talking about a constellation? I'm pretty sure there's supposed to be a bear one...」

I pan my gaze over the night sky.
％Ｂ
「Hmm...」
The sky's cloudless, like the weather forecast said. A slender crescent moon floats above.\n\r

I can see each and every star pretty clearly.
％Ｂ
「Though I dunno which ones make a bear.」
They really were imaginative back then, to make objects and animals out of groups of stars...

％Ｂ
「Hm... That's...」
There's a familiar-looking line of bright stars, a little to the west.\n\r

That ladle-looking shape has to be...
％Ｂ
「The Big Dipper... I remember I saw that in the field guide I was reading today.」

I think I remember reading that the "Big Dipper" was just a nickname, and that it's actually a part of another, actual constellation.

And that constellation is─
％Ｂ
「Ursa Major, the great bear.」
That must be what Ousaka was referring to.
I take another look at the Big Dipper and the stars surrounding it.
％Ｂ
「...What part of that's a bear...?」
Doesn't look like one to me.
Can't help but be impressed with what people saw in these back then...
％Ｂ
「Oh... I should respond.」
I start up LIME and type up a reply to Ousaka.
【％Ｂ】「I've spotted a big bear #Nto the north! You're #Ntalking about Ursa #NMajor, right? I can see #Nthe Big Dipper really #Nclearly. Which part of #NUrsa Major is it?」
％Ｂ
「Mhm. There we go.」
If we get permission tomorrow, I'll probably be able to see the Big Dipper through that telescope too.

％Ｂ
「And the weather's looking great too. I'm seriously getting real excit―」
％Ｂ
「Oh, she responded already? That was fast...」
【Sora】「The Big Dipper is the #Nbear's hip and tail. #NThe bear's identity is #Nthe nymph Callisto, a #Nservant of the goddess #NArtemis.」
【Sora】「Callisto pledged to the #Nvirgin goddess Artemis #Nthat she would never #Nhave a child. But she's #Nunable to resist Zeus's #Nseduction, and gives #Nbirth to a son, Arcas.」
【Sora】「Artemis transforms #NCallisto into a large #Nbear, as punishment for #Nbreaking her vow. #NThat's Ursa Major.」
％Ｂ
「N-Now she's sending me some kinda crazy explanation...」
Also what the hell, Zeus...
【Sora】「Her son Arcas one day #Nencounters a large bear #Nin the woods when he's #Nolder. He aims his bow #Nat the bear's heart #Nwithout knowing the #Ntruth.」
％Ｂ
「Whoa, hold on...」
Run!
Run away, Callisto!
【Sora】「Zeus takes pity on #Ntheir fates from above #Nand transforms Arcas #Ninto another bear and #Nraises them both to the #Nheavens. #NArcas is Ursa Minor.」
％Ｂ
「Phew... Thank god.」
Wait a second, is that a good thing?
It looks like Mr. Zeus solved things, but he was the reason this all happened in the first place, wasn't he? He's the main culprit.

【Sora】「Zeus's wife Hera gets #Njealous of their #Nhappiness and forbids #Nthem from resting in #Nthe sea. They have to #Ncircle the northern sky #Nforever, which is why #Nthey're always visible.」
Oh my god! Hera's the worst! What the hell is wrong with Zeus's family!? What's up with this horrifically sad tale!? It's all so harsh...

％Ｂ
「...Still, Ousaka knows a lot about this kinda stuff.」
She's just as talkative over LIME as she is in person when it comes to stars.
【Sora】「Find Dubhe and Merak in #Nthe Big Dipper and #Nextend a line 5 times #Nas long as the distance #Nbetween them to the #Nnorth. That's where the #NNorth Star is.」
％Ｂ
「But I don't know which ones Dubhe and Merak even are!」
Man, she's really something...
