Misa
「Please be careful. The ground there is slippery.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, okay. Thank you very much.」
％Ｂ
「You seem really familiar with this area...」
Misa
「I come here quite often. Oh, it's easy to stumble over that spot, so please be careful as you walk.」

all
She more or less prances through the rocky terrain.

It's completely at odds with the image I have in my head of her as a gentle sheltered girl.

And to contrast, there's Narusawa.
She's following after me, almost waddling, at the utter mercy of the unstable footing.

I turn around and step next to her.
％Ｂ
「Want me to hold your hand? I'll help you if you end up about to fall.」
Rikka
「Ah...gh, not neccesary. I'll be... fine.」
％Ｂ
「I'm offering 'cause it does look necessary, you know...」
Rikka
「Hyah...! Go on... ahead...」
She clearly isn't fine.
She looks like she might fall over any minute.
％Ｂ
「How about this, then? I'll go on ahead if you pass my test.」

Rikka
「Te...Test...? Ah, hyauh...」
％Ｂ
「I'm gonna poke you lightly in the shoulder with this finger. If you don't fall over, then I'll believe you.」

Rikka
「Wha...!? I-If you did that to me now I'd...」
％Ｂ
「You'd what?」
Rikka
「Gh! I-I'd claim it was sexual harassment! You've peeped on me, stalked me, pushed me down, and now it's sexual harassment!」


％Ｂ
「Don't say stuff like that! What are you gonna do if someone overhears!?」

Rikka
「But it's the truth.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, it is! But the problem's that you're purposefully wording it in a way that's misleading!」

Rikka
「Hmh... You're saying I'm distorting the truth? Then why did you peep on me and stalk me?」

She's pretty composed when the "pushed down" part isn't included.
％Ｂ
「That's because...」
Why was it? Hmm...
％Ｂ
「I guess all I can say is that the peeping was 'cause things just turned out that way. As for the stalking... It was just a casual thing?」

Rikka
「Hmmh... So you just casually stalk people, do you?」
％Ｂ
「Urgh... I'm starting to feel like I'm scum of the earth...」
Rikka
「Maybe you feel like it because you are?」
％Ｂ
「Sigh, I get it. This scum of the earth apologizes for walking beside you.」

all
％Ｂ
「I'll go on ahead, so don't fall over, all right?」
Rikka
「Oh...」
I hear a bit of a sad-sounding voice from behind me.
And then the sound of a quick footstep, as if she were trying to chase after me.
And then after that, the sound of something toppling...
Rikka
「Hyaaaaaaaaaahhhh!!?」
％Ｂ
「Narusawa!?」
I spin around just in time for Narusawa to come flying into my chest.
I catch the soft impact securely with my chest and arms.
Rikka
「～～～Ghhh.」
Her eyes, which were closed in anticipation of the incoming pain, crack open.
Her eyes go wide, and blink twice. And then a third time.
Rikka
「...Um, wha... What!? Auuuuhhh～～～!」
Seems she's finally noticed she fell into my arms.
Her cheeks go crimson and she screams.
％Ｂ
「See, what'd I tell you? It's dangerous.」
...And my heart's in the danger zone too.
Like, "Girls are so soft～" and "Wow she smells so nice～ Guys never smell like this～" and "Her hair sure feels ticklish on my neck～" and so on!


But I think things would go out of control if I freaked out too here. So I somehow force myself to play it cool.

％Ｂ
「Thank god you don't have to end up wet again―」
％Ｂ
「Uh...!」
I almost inadvertently turn my gaze to Narusawa's chest. I shake away my male nature and fix my head in place right where it is.

That's right, what I'm looking at is... the great expanse of the sea!
I choose to burn the beauty of nature into my retinas. Not boobs.
％Ｂ
「The ocean sure is pretty... Ahahahaha...」
Rikka
「What?」
％Ｂ
「...No, nothing.」
％Ｂ
「Can you stand?」
Rikka
「Yes...」
I hold Narusawa up by her arms and slowly pull myself away, and help her stand up.

％Ｂ
「You hurt anywhere? Like where you tripped?」
Rikka
「Mm... It's a little red, but it doesn't look like I'm bleeding.」
％Ｂ
「Be careful, all right? You're a girl, so you don't wanna get a scar or anything.」

Rikka
「...Mhm.」
Rikka
「...」
％Ｂ
「What's wrong? Narusawa?」
Her face is about as red as where she hit her leg.
She glances back and forth between my face and my right hand.
Rikka
「...Your hand.」
％Ｂ
「My hand?」
Rikka
「You said you'd lend me your hand earlier... I don't want to fall and get hurt.」

％Ｂ
「R-Right. Let's go, then.」
I extend my hand, and Narusawa grips my hand so lightly I can't really tell that she's touching me.

So I squeeze back just a bit more.
Rikka
「...Your hand's sweaty.」
％Ｂ
「You'll have to forgive me for that. I've never held hands with a girl before.」

Rikka
「Never?」
％Ｂ
「Never. Why do you ask?」
Rikka
「I was just a bit surprised. You seemed pretty casual about offering earlier.」
I've never ever held hands with a girl before.
I didn't think it'd be this nerve-racking just to hold hands...
I was nervous making the offer, but actually doing it's on a whole other level altogether.

Rikka
「...Thank you. For saving me. And... I went a little too far with what I was saying before. I'm sorry.」

％Ｂ
「It's fine. I was at fault too. Sorry about that.」
％Ｂ
「Anyway, Okihara-senpai's waiting for us. Let's go, slow and steady.」
We've wasted a decent amount of time.
She might already have arrived at the tide pools we're looking for by now.

Misa
「Ufufufufu...」
Okihara-senpai's off in the far distance, looking at us as if she were a mother fondly watching over a young married couple.

％Ｂ
「O-Okihara-senpai!? ...Were you watching?」
Misa
「I think it's very wonderful!」
％Ｂ
「Ah...hahaha...ha.」
...I'm gonna choose to not ask her to clarify what she means by that.
all
It's been about three hours since the three of us split up to do work.
The sun's climbed to its zenith, slowly cooking me from above.
A bead of sweat rolls down my forehead and drips into the tide pool.
％Ｂ
「It's soooo hot～～」
Misa
「Let's take a short break. There is a convenience store nearby.」
We buy drinks and snacks at the convenience store and walk back to the beach next to the rocky shoreline.

Misa
「The beach will be open to the public next month. I'm very excited!」
％Ｂ
「Oh really? I'm sure lots of people come here, with all this pretty-looking sand.」

Misa
「Yes! It becomes very lively, with many beach houses. Eating here would be nice once that happens.」


Misa
「...And are you sure you are okay? Is that not heavy?」
％Ｂ
「This isn't that big a deal for me.」
I'm carrying all of the stuff we bought at the convenience store.
The drinks are the only things with any real weight. The rest are all snacks, chocolates, and baked goods, so it's not that heavy.

Misa
「Boys are very dependable! Don't you think so too, Rikka-san?」

Rikka
「Wha...?」
She gives a start when Okihara-senpai suddenly asks for her opinion.
Misa
「He's very strong and dependable, isn't he?」
Rikka
「Yes. He is.」
She smiles warmly.
That smile of hers is strangely motivating.
％Ｂ
「Let's do our best for the afternoon too!」
all
％Ｂ
「We've collected a lot of different fish.」
There are lots of pretty fish swimming in the cooler boxes.

Misa
「Yes, we have! It's because you two worked so hard. Thank you very much.」
Misa
「We were unable to collect all of the fish I wished to, but I believe this is more than enough for now.」

％Ｂ
「Let's wrap things up here for today, then. I'll go call Narusawa over.」

Misa
「Thank you very much. I will pack up the equipment in the meantime.」

_00cutinBS
％Ｂ
「All right, where's Narusawa...? Oh! Hey, Narusawaaa!」
She's easy enough to spot.
But she just keeps looking downward. She gives no indication of having heard me.

_00cutinBS
％Ｂ
「Wait a second...」
Does she have heatstroke?
I thought we rehydrated enough earlier, but it's still possible with how strong the sunlight was today.

％Ｂ
「Narusawa, you feeling okay?」
Rikka
「...Wha...? Am I feeling okay? What are you talking about?」
She looks at me as I run over. She doesn't look like she's in bad shape.
％Ｂ
「No, it's just... You were looking down the whole time, so I thought you might not be feeling well...」

Rikka
「No. It's this...」
She looks down again―there's a crab in the small tide pool at her feet.
Rikka
「I tried to scoop it up with a net, but it keeps escaping into the gaps between the rocks. But it comes back out when I think of giving up... Is it making fun of me?」
％Ｂ
「Haha, maybe.」
Rikka
「It isn't a laughing matter. I don't like it...」
％Ｂ
「You won't be able to do it with a net. You'll have to grab it with your hands.」
Rikka
「With my hands!? Wha... My... My hands...?」
She blanches and looks at her hands.
％Ｂ
「Oh, right. I guess your hands are important to you as a pianist.」

Rikka
「I'm not that careful... but with my hands? Really?」
％Ｂ
「Huh? You've never touched a crab?」
Rikka
「No...」
％Ｂ
「I guess that makes sense. You're a girl after all...」
％Ｂ
「All right! Then how about I hold a seminar on catching crabs!」
I circle around so I'm behind the crab and crouch down.
％Ｂ
「You can't try from the front, 'cause they'll hide.」
％Ｂ
「So what you've gotta watch out for when you grab it are those two big claws.」

％Ｂ
「Hurts like crazy when they pinch you. Can make you bleed sometimes too! Just gushes out. They can even tear your finger clean off!」

Rikka
「Cut right...! I wasn't aware that crabs were such terrifying creatures...」
％Ｂ
「Well that just happens when you're unlucky. But don't worry, there's a way to do it that works 100 percent of the time.」

％Ｂ
「Crabs have a limited range of movement with their claws, so they can't reach everywhere.」

％Ｂ
「Specifically, they can't reach the back part of their body, and their belly. So you go like this―」
all
I dip my hand in the seawater and swiftly pin the crab against the rocks by pressing my index finger onto its back.

It struggles and brings its big claws to bear, but it can't get to my finger.

％Ｂ
「This way, the crab can't move freely, and it can't use its claws either.」
％Ｂ
「And now you just slide your thumb underneath its belly, and... there we go!」
I pick up the crab between my thumb and forefinger.
％Ｂ
「See? Easy, right?」
％Ｂ
「All right, how about you give it a try!」
I return the crab to the tide pool.
Rikka
「Ahh, why'd you let it go!? We're trying to catch it, aren't we!?」

％Ｂ
「Oh... Whoops. It appears I got a little too into the seminar mindset...」

Rikka
「Geez...」
％Ｂ
「Well that's in the past now, so how about you try catching it this time?」
Rikka
「You're telling me to get my fingers torn off?」
％Ｂ
「There won't be any issues if you do what I did just now. I guarantee it.」
Rikka
「...Sigh. Fine...」
all
Narusawa moves behind the crab, just like I did.
The crab hasn't noticed her.
She slowly dips her index finger into the water.
The crab still hasn't noticed.
Rikka
「Pin... its back...」
She's almost touching its back.
But...
She didn't come in from the right angle.
Rikka
「Kyaaaaaaaahhhhh!!」
all
She falls back on her butt when the crab swings its claws at her.
％Ｂ
「Pff, pkhh, ahahahahah!! Y-You okay?」
Rikka
「This isn't a laughing matter! I was this close to bleeding from my finger! What if it tore my finger off...!?」


％Ｂ
「Sorry. I lied about that.」
Rikka
「You... lied...?」
％Ｂ
「I have heard of stories where crabs can sever people's fingers, but a crab this small's only gonna hurt a bit. It won't even make you bleed.」


Rikka
「Ghh... Ghhh～～ ...Uughhhh～～～!!」
She turns the same pretty red color as the crab out of humiliation.
％Ｂ
「Looks like Okihara-senpai's about done packing up, so let's grab this guy and get going too.」

all
I pick up the crab and put it in the cooler box.
I close the lid and pick it up.
％Ｂ
「Let's go, Narusawaaa.」
Rikka
「Ghhh～...」
Misa
「Rikka-san has been acting strangely for a while now. Did something happen, perhaps?」

％Ｂ
「I'm not sure... I wonder what it could be. Hahaha...」
Rikka
「Mmmhhh...」
Narusawa was in a bad mood the rest of the way home.
Marika
「Wooow, they're so pretty～!」

Sora
「*nod* Neither inferior nor su... They're just as amazing as the stars.」
The fish we caught are swimming freely in the tanks that the others set up.
all
Rikka
「This isn't bad.」
Looks like she's finally in a better mood.
all
I sigh in relief at that and look at Okihara-senpai.
％Ｂ
「We've now taken the first step toward the Tanabata Festival.」
Misa
「Yes! I look forward to continuing to work with you!」
