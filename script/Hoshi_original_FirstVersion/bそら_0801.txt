I immediately head to the firm in the morning with the blueprint I spent all night drafting out.

％Ｂ
「What do you think...?」
Azuma-san's staring intently at the design I printed out.
％Ｂ
「...Um...」
Azuma
「...This is your solution after a day of thinking?」
％Ｂ
「Y-Yes... Is it not good enough?」
Azuma
「Hmph... You pass, I guess.」
％Ｂ
「Really!?」
Azuma
「Yeah. Good on you for realizing a soccer ball could be useful.」
And he's praised me!
Azuma
「You've shown you've got the imagination to detach yourself from the preconception of "buildings" and use what's around you to your advantage... That's a necessary skill for an architect.」


％Ｂ
「Y-Yes...!」
Azuma
「Still, though... Guess I got this for nothing, then. You can have it.」

He turns to me and tosses a handball-sized soccer ball at me.

％Ｂ
「Wha...? Is this...?」
Azuma
「If you don't need it, then I don't care if you toss it. It was cheap anyway.」
％Ｂ
「...Teacher...!」
Azuma
「Stop with the "Teacher"... I don't see any problems with the calculations on the blueprint either. Give it a try.」

％Ｂ
「Thank you very much! We'll start building right away! I'll be excusing myself―」

Azuma
「Ah, wait a second. There's some cardboard in the kitchen. Hurry up and get rid of it for me. It's taking up space.」


％Ｂ
「Wha...?」
Azuma
「I asked the firm workers and got some together. Should be able to contribute a little to the materials you need.」

％Ｂ
「～! Yes! I will gratefully accept it!」
I head to school with the cardboard in hand.
I'm caught by surprise when someone calls out to me on the way.
Staff
「Heeey, Shio-wan～」
％Ｂ
「Uh...」
There are a very limited number of people who know I was Shio-wan.\n \n\r
I turn around. It's the staff member from the Shionagi chamber of commerce Sora and I met back when we were working here.

％Ｂ
「Hello.」
Staff
「Long time no see. We haven't talked since the advertising events.」
％Ｂ
「Thank you very much for everything back then.」
Staff
「Oh no, you two really helped us out too. Shio-wan and Shio-nyah got more popular thanks to you two, after all. We're actually at the point where we're discussing making merchandise now.」


％Ｂ
「Are you really?」
Staff
「We'll be counting on you to wear the suit again when that happens.」
％Ｂ
「U-Uh huh... If I have the time, then yes.」
Staff
「Speaking of which, you said you were going to be using that money to make a planetarium for your school's Tanabata Festival, right? I'll definitely come by to the Shionagi First Academy Tanabata Festival.」


％Ｂ
「Wha... Really? Thank you very much. We'll be looking forward to seeing you there!」

Staff
「If you want, we can lend you the costume again, so you can use that there too.」

％Ｂ
「I-I think... I'd like some time to think that offer over.」
Staff
「By the way, what's that cardboard for?」
％Ｂ
「Oh, this? We're using it for the planetarium.」
Staff
「Cardboard for a planetarium?」
％Ｂ
「Yes... You see...」
I explain the specifics of the dome to him.
Staff
「I see, so you're collecting cardboard for that. Okay! I'll ask around the chamber of commerce and see if anyone's got any leftover cardboard too.」


％Ｂ
「Wha... Are you sure?」
Staff
「Of course. Though I'm sure other students have gone around to almost all of the shops at this point, so I don't know how much people will have left over.」


％Ｂ
「That's fine... Even just a little bit would be helpful. Thank you very much!」

％Ｂ
「Take a look, everyone.」
I unfold the new design sheet in front of the others.
Marika
「Is this a soccer ball?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. I drew this out after I was inspired by a soccer ball. This is a diagram of a dome made up of polygons.」


Touko
「Huh, looks kinda cool.」
all
Rikka
「It isn't bad.」

Misa
「The surface looks very wonderful.」
Sora
「...Better than the last one.」
all
Marika
「But can we make something like this?」
％Ｂ
「Don't worry. It's nothing but straight lines, and there's only two types of pieces in terms of size and shape. If anything, it should be even easier than the last one.」


Natsuki
「How about we get started right away, then?」
all
％Ｂ
「Yeah, let's do that. We'll need to make templates with plastic first...」
Sora
「...There is no need to worry. We still have some left over from the last time.」
Right. I forgot that Sora's still in the middle of her speech conditioning.

I see Narusawa's eyes glinting behind Sora.
％Ｂ
「Sora and Narusawa, could you two pick out the parts of the previous dome that look usable?」

Rikka
「Okay.」
Sora
「...Yes, we can.」
all
Marika
「We can't paint yet, so I guess we'll go collect cardboard.」
Misa
「Yes. Let's do our best.」
all
Natsuki
「Hey, Touko. Wanna compete to see who can gather up more?」

Touko
「A competition? Sounds good. Penalty game and everything?」
Natsuki
「Natch! The loser buys drinks for the winner. Marika, Misa-san, do you wanna do it too?」

Marika
「Mhm, I'll join in.」
all
Misa
「I would relish the opportunity.」
Everyone cheerily gets to work. I don't see even the slightest hint of the gloom from yesterday.

all
The cardboard collection group leaves school, and Sora and Narusawa head to the classroom we've been keeping the cardboard from the previous dome in.

％Ｂ
「All right... Now let's get started on cutting out those templates.」
I grab a plastic cutter and take another look at the blueprint.
Sora
「
Ryou
Mm
...」
Sora's come back alone.
％Ｂ
「Hm? What's wrong? Forget something?」
Sora
「...*shake shake*」
She shakes her head a little and runs over to me.
She hugs my waist tight.
Sora
「...Thank you.」
She rubs her forehead against my chest as she thanks me.
Rikka
「Ousaka-saaan, I'm going!」
Sora
「...Bye.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. Counting on you.」
We look around to see if anyone's around, and then kiss gently.
We smile at each other as we pull away.
all
Five days until the festival... Let's do this.
