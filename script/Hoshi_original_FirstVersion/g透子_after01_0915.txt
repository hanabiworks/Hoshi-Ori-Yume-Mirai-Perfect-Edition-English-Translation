Today's the day of my second exam.
The drafting portion of trying to become qualified to be a second-class architect.
％Ｂ
「I'm going, then. I'll be done after today's exam, so I'll be able to focus on helping you with your studies after I get back.」

Touko
「Mm, good luck. Let's celebrate you being done once you're back.」

I've done everything I can.
I need to make sure I pass, for Touko's sake too.
％Ｂ
「I don't mind it just being the two of us celebrating me passing.」
Touko
「Ahaha, got it. I'll have some cake ready too.」
She cheers me on with a smile.
This smile gets me to do my best.

％Ｂ
「All right, I'm off!」
Touko
「Oh, just a second. You forgot something.」
％Ｂ
「Huh?」
I've got my admission ticket, my proof of passing the subject exam, and my writing supplies.
I don't need a lunch today either, so what did I...?
Touko
「Chu.」
％Ｂ
「Mmh...」
Touko
「...It's a good luck charm. This'll power you up like usual, so you'll pass for sure.」

A small kiss. Just a brush of the lips.
I guess I must've been a little anxious after all. I had forgotten about our usual send-off.

％Ｂ
「Haha, I really can't fail now, can I?」
Touko
「Good luck. I'll have lots of tasty food ready for you when you come back.」

％Ｂ
「Thanks. I'll do my best!」
