「Good evening!」
Azuma
「Hey, it's you. What do you want today?」
％Ｂ
「I'm actually here today to request something of you, Teacher.」
Azuma
「...Let me say this upfront. I'm not lending you any money.」
％Ｂ
「What? You won't?」
Azuma
「I don't lend or borrow money on principle.」
％Ｂ
「Well I don't need money, but I'd like you to lend me something else.」
Azuma
「Something else?」
％Ｂ
「I think it may be something even more valuable than money, in a way. To me, at least. This is an impolite request, but...」


Azuma
「Stop dancing around the point and just ask.」
％Ｂ
「Then I will... Could I borrow the blueprints to Marinpia Shionagi?」
Azuma
「Excuse me? You want Marinpia's blueprints?」
％Ｂ
「Um... Would it not be okay?」
Azuma
「Even before talking about if it's okay or not... Last time you came here and told me to tell you why Marinpia closed down, and now you want the blueprints? What are you even trying to do?」


all
％Ｂ
「Well―」
I tell Azuma-san everything that's happened until now.
Azuma
「Hoh... So the daughter of Marinpia's ex-director wants to make an aquarium for your school's Tanabata Festival.」

％Ｂ
「Yes. She's an amazing person who loves Shionagi's sea and the fish that live there. She's always bright, and she has passion... She's even thinking of reopening Marinpia herself one day...」

Azuma
「So is she cute?」
％Ｂ
「Wha? Oh... well... um... yes.」
Azuma
「Hm... So in a nutshell, you've been running around doing all this stuff because you want to show off to her.」

％Ｂ
「It-It's not like I want to show off to her. I just want to see her smile, and that's why...」

Azuma
「And if you summarize that, you're saying you're doing it for the woman you fell for.」
％Ｂ
「I-I don't know if I'd call her that...」
Azuma
「Am I wrong?」
％Ｂ
「You're... Well... You're right.」
Azuma
「Mhm, it's good to be honest. So, what are you planning on doing with Marinpia's blueprints?」

％Ｂ
「...I'm thinking of making a model. I want to make a model of Marinpia, and display it alongside the fish.」

Azuma
「What's the point of displaying a model of an aquarium that's closed down?」
％Ｂ
「It would make the guests who liked Marinpia happy, and it may get the children who never got to go interested in going someday.」


％Ｂ
「I was thinking that Marinpia could really reopen one day if we could get even a few more voices supporting it.」

Azuma
「And so that's for the sake of that girl you fell for too?」
％Ｂ
「It's... Yes.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, but of course, I also want lots of people to see the greatness of your architecture, Teacher!」


Azuma
「You thought of saying that just now, didn't you?」
％Ｂ
「No, of course not...」
Azuma
「Hmph... Ah well.」
all
Azuma-san gets up, slides open a glass door on a shelf, and starts searching through it.

Azuma
「Let's see... Which one was it... Over here... Ah, here it is. Here.」

He hands me a heavy manila folder.
Azuma
「Those are Marinpia's blueprints.」
％Ｂ
「I-Is it okay? Are you sure?」
Azuma
「You're asking that now? You're the one who demanded to have them.」

％Ｂ
「I know, but...」
No matter how great a building is, it can't be constructed without blueprints.\n \n\r
It wouldn't be exaggerating to say that the completed and fully calculated blueprints of a building are the soul of an architect's final product.

And he just casually handed me, just some student, those blueprints...
Azuma
「Just so you know, I won't forgive you if you half-ass my design. If you're going to make it, then it's going to have to be perfect.」

He smiles as he says it.
He must just be joking around.
But...
％Ｂ
「I know. Just watch me.」
Azuma
「Hoh.」
％Ｂ
「I wasn't planning on making something mediocre in the first place. I'll recreate your design perfectly!」

I failed dismally back when I initially interviewed here.
To me, this is payback for that time.
％Ｂ
「I'll bring it here to show you once I'm finished!」
Azuma
「Sounds good. I'm looking forward to it.」
