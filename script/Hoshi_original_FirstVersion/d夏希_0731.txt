We went to the shopping center in the morning to pick up the developed photos from two days ago.
We got large-scale printings for making panels instead of the usual standard size.
They came out so well that the lady at the camera store complimented Natsuki on them.
We head to where Ousaka is with the freshly developed photos in hand.
Ousaka's in the old school building to make her mythology panel.
Yukimura's with her.
Natsuki
「How are they?」
We hand them the photos and await their feedback.
Touko
「Wow... What the heeeck! You took all of these, Camera-chan?」
Natsuki
「Mhm. I took photos of all of the constellations you can see from Shionagi in the summer, just like Sora asked.」

Touko
「Fwah... These are amazing. It's the kinda night sky that makes you just wanna stare.」

Sora
「...」
Ousaka's just silently looking at the photos, in stark contrast to how Yukimura's just raving over them.\n\r

That indifferent demeanor's actually scarier...
Touko
「What constellation's this one?」
Sora
「...Corona Borealis.」
Touko
「How about this one?」
Sora
「...Corona Australis.」
Touko
「Wow... You're amazing too, Fluffyhead. You can tell just from a glance?」

Touko
「Oh, I know this one too. It's Cygnus, right?」
Sora
「...That's Aquila.」
Touko
「...I admit defeat.」
％Ｂ
「You're just as amazing as ever, Ousaka...」
all
I genuinely think Ousaka's amazing when it comes to stars.
But if we can satisfy that Ousaka with these, then Natsuki's photos are just as...

Sora
「...」
Ousaka finishes looking through all of the photos.
％Ｂ
「What do you think?」
Sora
「...Mh!」
She snaps up her thumb stronger than ever before.
Sora
「...They're great.」
％Ｂ
「Aaall right!」

Natsuki
「Phew...」
Natsuki breathes out a sigh of relief.
We had already gotten a good review on the photo of Sagittarius, but it looks like she just couldn't rest easy until she got them all looked over.

Sora
「...Thank you, Natsu.」
Natsuki
「Mm, mm... I should be the one thanking you. I feel like I was able to grow as a cameraman thanks to you. Thank you, Sora.」


％Ｂ
「That's great, Natsuki.」
Natsuki
「Yeah, this is great... Honestly.」
Touko
「Mmm... Stuff like this isn't bad either. Maybe I should've helped you guys out too.」

all
％Ｂ
「Oh, right. We need to give you your equatorial mount back. It's at my house right now. You fine taking it back tomorrow?」


Natsuki
「Oh, 
Ryousuke, 

hold on.」
Natsuki
「Sora, I have a request. Could I borrow the equatorial mount for one more day?」

Natsuki
「There's a photo I want to take. Can I?」

Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「Ousaka...?」
Sora
「...On a condition.」
Natsuki
「Okay. Anything.」
Sora
「...I want duplicates of these photos for myself.」
Natsuki
「Duplicates...? Of course you can have them. These photos were all for you anyway, so I'll give you as many duplicates of these as you want.」


Sora
「...End of negotiations.」
She holds out her hand to Natsuki.
And Natsuki firmly grasps it in a handshake.
Natsuki
「Thank you!」
Sora
「...Hehe.」
Touko
「Ohh, I don't think I've ever seen Fluffyhead smile...」
％Ｂ
「She must've been real happy about it.」
all
Natsuki
「So
 Ryousuke

! One more night, okay?」
She winks at me.
％Ｂ
「Yeah, of course!」
all
Later that night─
Natsuki and I are setting up the equipment at the campground.
I'm preparing the equatorial mount.\n\r
Natsuki's looking off of the planisphere to see what the right direction is.
％Ｂ
「Attach the camera... There. Okay, we're good. We're ready to go, Natsuki.」

Natsuki
「Mhm, thanks.」
％Ｂ
「So what's this photo you wanna take?」
She points at the night sky.
Natsuki
「The lovers in the night sky!」
％Ｂ
「...So Vega and Altair.」
Natsuki
「Come on. I said it so romantically and everything.」
％Ｂ
「Okay then, Orihime and Hikoboshi.」
Natsuki
「But that's just saying it like it iiis.」
％Ｂ
「But why do you wanna take that now...?」
Natsuki
「Mmm... I thought I could submit it to that contest.」
％Ｂ
「You mean the one from the poster we saw before?」
Natsuki
「Yeah, that one. The Tanabata Festival photo contest that's being put on by the city of Shionagi.」
％Ｂ
「You said you'd do it if you got a good photo. So you're feeling motivated now?」
Natsuki
「I feel like I can get one now. Though we'll have to actually take the photo before we start talking about submitting it. But the deadline's soon, so I'll need to take one while I still can.」


She peers through the viewfinder and settles the camera on the stars she wants to get.
Natsuki
「...Okay... Start the equatorial mount.」
all
％Ｂ
「All right... Okay, it's going.」
Natsuki
「Mm... The rest's up to luck.」
％Ｂ
「...Luck?」
She's already gotten Ousaka's seal of approval for her star photos, so I don't think there should be any kind of issues.\n\r

Natsuki steps away from the camera and walks up to me.
Natsuki
「Hey, let's sit.」
％Ｂ
「Sure.」
all
We sit down on the blanket I brought and look vaguely up at the sky.
Natsuki
「The Tanabata Festival's coming up soon. I feel like we still had two whole months left only just a little while ago.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah... Time passed in the blink of an eye.」
Natsuki
「I'm glad I was able to get good photos for both the naturalist and astronomy clubs. If I had messed up for one of them, I don't know if I would've been able to show my face there anymore...」


％Ｂ
「Or, you could've messed up both.」
Natsuki
「Geez, stop it! Don't say stuff like that.」
％Ｂ
「Ahaha, my bad.」
It's something I can only joke about now that it's gone well for both.
Natsuki
「By the way, you said we're planning on going out somewhere with everyone after the school's Tanabata Festival, right?」

％Ｂ
「Yeah... Though we haven't even started talking about where and stuff.」
Natsuki
「And you were talking about how you wanted us to go somewhere with just us too, right? Do you wanna go to the Tanabata Festival for that?」

％Ｂ
「You mean the city's?」
Natsuki
「Yeah. Since you said you don't remember it much from back when you were a kid.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah. I have some vague memories, but I don't remember any specifics, like what I ate or what I saw.」

Natsuki
「Then let's go and do lots of stuff together. We'll do lots of different things and make sure you remember everything this time!」


％Ｂ
「I like the sound of that. It's a festival, so I guess you'll be in a yukata, huh.」
Natsuki
「Huh? I'm not going to wear a yukata, though.」
％Ｂ
「Why not?」
Natsuki
「It'd be hard to take photos in a yukata. What kinda cameraman wouldn't take photos at a festival?」

％Ｂ
「Pff... Haha! So photography's required even on our dates, eh?」
Natsuki
「But if you want me to control myself, then I will...」
％Ｂ
「I won't. Photography's a part of who you are, Natsuki. And it's fun for me to watch you take photos too.」

Natsuki
「Oh man, now that makes me blush!」
％Ｂ
「The Tanabata Festival... I'm looking forward to it.」
Natsuki
「I know. Let's see who's better at goldfish scooping. I've always been good at it since I was a kid.」

％Ｂ
「Oh, come on. Who do you think you're challenging here? I don't study architecture just for show, you know.」

Natsuki
「There's that line again. But I'm pretty sure this time there's no way that matters...」
％Ｂ
「Oh, it totally does!」
％Ｂ
「Goldfish scooping's all about balance. You have to think about the weight of the goldfish, the scoop's durability, the angle of entry into the water, and the scoop's angle and speed. It's easy if you balance all of that!」


Natsuki
「...Aren't you just kinda forcing it to be relevant to architecture?」
％Ｂ
「Believe, and it'll come true! ...Wait, I guess I'm admitting it at this point... Anyway, I'm good at goldfish scooping too.」


Natsuki
「We'll have a penalty for the loser, then.」
％Ｂ
「You just love penalties, don't you?」
Natsuki
「Whoever loses has to pay for all of the food that day.」
％Ｂ
「....No way.」
Natsuki
「Hmm? What's this, now? Scaaared, are weee?」
％Ｂ
「Hmph, as if! I accept your conditions!」
Natsuki
「All right! Now I'm looking forward to it. I'm getting a candied apple, obviously. And okonomiyaki, and shaved ice's a must, and beef skewers, and kebab... and it's aaall going to be your treat


, Ryousuke

!」
％Ｂ
「Wait! Why are you saying it like I've already lost?」
Natsuki
「Oh, and I'll have to get rotation rolls too.」
％Ｂ
「Rotation rolls...? What are those?」
Natsuki
「What? You don't know what rotation rolls are? They're these round cakes with stuff like red bean paste or custard inside.」

％Ｂ
「Those are Imagawa rolls.」
Natsuki
「The heck's an Imagawa roll? I've never heard them called that.」
％Ｂ
「No, you're definitely describing Imagawa rolls.」
Natsuki
「We call them rotation rolls over here, you know.」
％Ｂ
「Why would I know what you call them here? An Imagawa roll's an Imagawa roll.」
Natsuki
「Ughhh, see? This is what happens when you throw away Shionagi... It's so gross. It's like you're bragging about how city-folk you are.」

％Ｂ
「I-I did not throw Shionagi away! I came back! And I didn't live in a huge city or anything anyway!」

Natsuki
「Then you'll have to call them rotation rolls from now on.」
％Ｂ
「I don't wanna... That's so lame.」
Natsuki
「What's so lame about rotation rolls!?」
％Ｂ
「I don't even get the name. What's a rotation roll even supposed to be? What, do you rotate them while you cook them? You guys know they just flip those over, right?」


Natsuki
「I-Imagawa roll doesn't make any sense either. Who's Imagawa-san? Do they mean that guy that Nobunaga killed? He made them?」


％Ｂ
「Why would I know what the name's from? But Imagawa rolls are Imagawa rolls.」

Natsuki
「They're rotation rooolls.」
％Ｂ
「Looks like you're not gonna back down. All right, then we'll add it to the penalty. Whoever loses has to use what the other person says. How's that?」

Natsuki
「Y-You're on!」
％Ｂ
「By the way, I'm gonna make you call baby castellas dick rolls.」
Natsuki
「Di... Wh-What the heck!? Baby castellas are baby castellas!」

％Ｂ
「They apparently used to call them that in Kansai.」
％Ｂ
「So whoever loses has to go up to the baby castella stall and yell out, "One dick roll, please!"」


Natsuki
「I-I can't believe you... Is it that fun for you to make your own girlfriend say things like that...?」

％Ｂ
「...」
％Ｂ
「...Yeah, I think it might be.」
Natsuki
「Uuugh... You freak...!」
％Ｂ
「Oh man, now I'm really looking forward to the Tanabata Festival! Let's make lots of good memories together!」

Natsuki
「I'm starting to get depressed about it...」
