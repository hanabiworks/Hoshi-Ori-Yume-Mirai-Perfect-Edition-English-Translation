Oono
「Thank you very much.」
Oono's Wife
「Please excuse our intrusion.」
The Oonos have come to our office.
I asked them to come.
％Ｂ
「I apologize for having you come. Normally I'd be the one to come to you, but...」

Oono
「Oh no, there's no need at all to apologize. We should be thanking you, as it seems you've built us a new model.」

They've already spotted it.
The new model house I've made.
I made it with their requests entirely in mind.
Oono's Wife
「Wow... You really did make it.」
％Ｂ
「I'll explain the details now.」
I grab a fiberscope camera.
I've got it set up so it sends the image to a nearby monitor. 
I'm going to place this inside so they can experience what it'd look like if they were physically standing inside the house.

％Ｂ
「This is the living room of the most recently made house plan.」
Oono's Wife
「Oh my... It's very big.」
％Ｂ
「I believe it would be easy to arrange furniture in this room, as per your requests.」

Oono's Wife
「It's very nice. The kitchen's spacious too. It has a very refreshing feel to it.」

％Ｂ
「It's a single, large, continuous space, so it appears very large. But... there is a problem. The plot for your home has a house directly beside it on the south side...」


I place a styrofoam board against the relevant living room window.
Oono's Wife
「Oh my... It's become quite dark.」
％Ｂ
「Exactly. The living room faces the south, so sunlight will be blocked to a significant degree for most of the day.」


Oono
「You're right...」
％Ｂ
「On the other hand, with our plan from earlier...」
I place the camera inside the other model.
I put the partition against this model's living room window.
Oono's Wife
「Oh? It doesn't get very dark in this one.」
％Ｂ
「Exactly. That would be thanks to the extra light that this plan's "shift" affords us.」

Oono's Wife
「I didn't think it'd be so different...」
It's obvious once you actually compare the two.
Oono-san's wife looks shocked at the difference.
％Ｂ
「It's most apparent in the living room, but most of the other rooms also have the same effect.」

I move through the houses one room at a time.
I have them see how the brightness changes throughout the day by changing the angle of the light source too.

Oono's Wife
「I see...」
％Ｂ
「The Azuma firm's design is made to collaborate with nature.」
Oono's Wife
「Collaborate... with nature?」
％Ｂ
「We human beings cannot create nature ourselves. It's something given to us, and we must accept and appreciate it. Most important among the things given to us by nature is "light."」


Oono's Wife
「Light...」
％Ｂ
「One can purchase nice lighting these days, but there's no replacement for sunlight. Our design prioritizes that most important thing, and all parts of the design are built around that concept.」


Oono's Wife
「Oh my. I didn't know you had put so much thought into it. I didn't even know that, and I...」

％Ｂ
「Oh, no. A house belongs to the people who live in it. The most important thing is that the residents are satisfied.」

％Ｂ
「But it's hard to know what's for the best unless you actually try living in the house. Houses aren't something you buy time after time throughout your life either.」


％Ｂ
「And so, we like to consider helping the residents discover what is "best" to also be a vital part of our jobs.」

％Ｂ
「Let's find the "best house for you" together.」

Oono's Wife
「...Yes!」
Oono
「We're very grateful. Hey, you know... Don't you think the old design's better after all?」

Oono's Wife
「Yes, you're right... This brightness is really nice...」
％Ｂ
「But still, we also think that the previous design was not without its flaws.」

Oono's Wife
「Oh... What flaws?」
％Ｂ
「This is a revised blueprint. We've found several parts that we would like to change, after you amended your requests to us.」


％Ｂ
「And so I would like to suggest a new plan that reflects those changes...」
I show them the blueprint that I have prepared.
I explained things to Azuma-san and asked him to draft out a new one.
％Ｂ
「I apologize for this being nothing more than my own conjecture... but was the reason for your emphasis on the easy furniture arrangement because you wished to place your dowry furniture?」


Oono's Wife
「Oh... How did you know?」
％Ｂ
「The subject of furniture came up quite often in our discussions, so I thought it may have been the case.」

Oono
「What? ...If you had just told me...」
Oono's Wife
「But dear... You wouldn't have listened to me if I did, would you?」
Oono
「What are you talking about? That's important...」
The two of them are smiling in embarrassment.
Looks like I hit the nail right on the head.
％Ｂ
「And so this time we attempted to design the house with a new room for that furniture. It's this room here. It's designed to fit everything perfectly.」


Oono
「You even did all this...」
％Ｂ
「There are several other minor changes, so I'll go over them.」

Oono's Wife
「Yes, please do!」
The Oonos' eyes gleam.
Great. Looks like this is going to go well.
Oono
「Thank you so very much. We'd like to take this home and discuss this between the two of us...」

Oono's Wife
「But this was wonderful. I'm sure we'll end up asking you to move ahead using this plan.」

Looks like they've taken a liking to the new plan.
％Ｂ
「We look forward to working with you too.」
Oono
「How about it? Would you like to get a drink together after work today? It'll be our treat.」

％Ｂ
「Huh? After this...?」
My studying comes to mind.
I'm a little behind because I got caught up with putting together this new plan.

Azuma
「Go let them treat you.」
％Ｂ
「Oh. Azuma-san?」
Looks like he just happened to get back.
He was probably listening to our conversation.
Azuma
「An architect and his client are more or less family... Oono-san, he may be a greenhorn, but please treat him well.」

all
Oono
「Oh no, likewise! But if you're busy, then we won't force you...」

％Ｂ
「No, I'll gladly accept.」
An architect and his client are family, huh.
He might be right. Maybe that's what it takes to build a good home.\n\r
When you're family, you eat food together and enjoy things together.
％Ｂ
「Though I'll have you know, despite how I look... I can hold my liquor.」
Oono's Wife
「Ahaha, well that's good!」
Oono
「We'll certainly have to put that to the test.」
I'll treasure each and every thing before me.
I don't want to sacrifice one thing for another.
I don't want to ignore anything.
I feel like things will definitely turn out good if I hold myself to that.
％Ｂ
「Phew... I drank too much...」
It's just barely before midnight.
％Ｂ
「It's a bit late, but I think I'll take a shower and study.」
％Ｂ
「Oh. It's Marika.」
【Marika】「Still working?」
【％Ｂ】「Just got home.」
【Marika】「Great job working so late～」
【Marika】_st_0103
【％Ｂ】「I got a little caught #Nup talking with my #Nclients.」
【％Ｂ】「But it was fun. I #Nreally feel like I've #Ngotta make a good home #Nfor them now.」
【Marika】「Really? That's great～ #NAre you going to sleep #Nnow then?」
【％Ｂ】「I'm gonna study a bit, #Nthen sleep. I need to #Nmake up for the time I #Nlost today.」
【％Ｂ】「Sorry I've been so busy #Nlately. I wish I could #Nsee you for even a #Nlittle bit, but I don't #Nhave time...」
【Marika】「Don't worry about that, #Nokay? I'm fine with #NLIME, and you call me #Nlots...」
【Marika】「I'm not lonely. #NBecause I know you love #Nme.」
【Marika】_st_0101
So she says...
But I still wanna see her face.

...Oh, I know.
【％Ｂ】「Hey, can I FaceTalk you #Nright now?」
【Marika】「Huh? Sure... but I #Ndon't know if I'll be #Nable to do it～」
【％Ｂ】「We added the app #Ntogether, didn't we? #NI'll try it.」
【Marika】「Okay～ Just give me 10 #Nminutes, I'll get ready.」
【Marika】_st_0110
I wonder if it'll work.
I wait for a while like she says.
I start up the app.
After the connection sound plays for a bit...
Marika
「Wow, it connected!」
％Ｂ
「Ohh!」
An image appears on the screen.
I didn't think the quality would be this good.
Recent smartphones sure are impressive.
％Ｂ
「Good evening, Marika.」
Marika
『G-Good evening～ ...Umm, is this how you do it～?』

％Ｂ
「Mhm. Not at all.」
Marika
『Oh... Wait, am I not on screen?』
％Ｂ
「I can only see your forehead.」
Marika
『U-Umm... L-Like this?』
％Ｂ
「There we go. See how the camera's up at the top of the phone? That's where you need to center your face.」

Marika
『Oh yeah, now that you mention it. I can't help but look more at the screen, since that's where your face is...』


Marika
『Oh yeah, now that you mention it. I can't help but look more at the screen, since that's where your face is...』


％Ｂ
「And you're moving off screen again.」
Marika
『Wawah...!』
％Ｂ
「Isn't there a smaller screen toward the bottom? You can see your own face in that one.」

Marika
『Oh, this one? You're right, there it is...』

Marika
『Oh, but... Umm... I'm very sorry...』
％Ｂ
「What are you apologizing for?」
Marika
『Because... I don't have any makeup on...』
％Ｂ
「It's not like you wear that much usually anyway though.」
Marika
『Whaaat? But I think I look different～』
％Ｂ
「What are you talking about? You're always cute, Marika.」
Marika
『Wha... W-Wah～ O-Oh, okay... That makes me happy～』

％Ｂ
「You're very welcome.」
Marika
『Hehe...』
Yumi
『Good for you, Marika.』
Marika
『...!?』
％Ｂ
「Th-That voice...」
Marika
『G-Geeez! Mom, you were listening?』
Yumi
『I don't have to try to overhear when you're talking that loudly. You were just running around the house worrying about not having makeup on.』
Yumi
『You were like, "Maybe I should put on a mask and say I have a cold"...』
Marika
『P-Pay no attention to this conversation, okay～ You're getting up early tomorrow, aren't you, Mom? You should sleep already!』


Yumi
『Yes, yes. Enjoy your steamy night.』
Yumi
『Good night, Ryousuke-kuuun!』
Yumi
『Good niiight!』
％Ｂ
「R-Right...」
I hear footsteps as Yumi-san leaves the room.
Marika
『S-Sorry about that～』
％Ｂ
「N-No, it's fine. I'm the one who said we should FaceTalk out of nowhere anyway...」


％Ｂ
「And I thought you were in your room, but... you're in the living room?」
Marika
『Oh, y-yes, I am... The wifi's bad in my room, so...』


Marika
『A-And... my dad's working late tonight. It looks like my mom's gone up to her room too... so we can talk without worrying now.』


％Ｂ
「O-Oh, okay.」
Marika
『And so... P-Please go ahead... Talk about anything!』

％Ｂ
「S-Sure! Then...」
Marika
『Yes...』
％Ｂ
「Uhh... I don't really have anything to talk about, to be honest... I just... kinda wanted to see your face.」


Marika
『A-Ahaha... Y-Yeah, that's true. What am I doing...?』

％Ｂ
「But... I'm relieved now.」
Marika
『Huh?』
％Ｂ
「I was real busy today, and I was on edge the whole time... I couldn't really calm down even after I got home. But I feel like I've gotten a load off my chest now that I've seen your face.」


Marika
『Really...』
Marika
『Th-Then... If you're fine with it being my face, then please look as much as you'd like!』

％Ｂ
「Marika, you're too close. It's just your forehead again!」
Marika
『A-Aaahhhh...!? What am I doing? Again... Ahahaha...』

She's giggling.
I'll never get tired of seeing her like this.
Marika
『Oh? Is your face red? Did you go out drinking tonight?』

％Ｂ
「Yeah, I did. I went out for a drink with Oono-san. He's the client I was talking about before. It was his treat.」


Marika
『Whaaat, really? So then the stuff with the models went okay?』

％Ｂ
「Yeah, way better than I expected. The plan worked out great.」
％Ｂ
「Both Oono-san and his wife were satisfied... They were all for our plan by the end of the meeting.」

Marika
『Really? That's great. All that hard work was worth it.』
％Ｂ
「This is all thanks to you too.」
Marika
『Whaaat? I don't think I did anything～』
％Ｂ
「No, it's 'cause you were there for me. I just can't help but let myself get too invested in one way of thinking when it's just me. Maybe it's just a guy thing...」


％Ｂ
「But a lot of the time, it's the woman that watches over the house. I realized that after what you said. Thanks.」

Marika
『Wh-Whaaat～ ...I didn't do anything... but if I was useful, then I'm glad.』

％Ｂ
「Great job, Marika. I kinda wanna do something to thank you.」

Marika
『Huh? Really?』
％Ｂ
「Yeah, anything's fine. It can be food, or if you want something...」
Marika
『I can... ask you for something?』
％Ｂ
「'Course.」
Marika
『Oh, then, then...』
Marika
『I would like... a kiss.』
％Ｂ
「Uh...」
％Ｂ
「N-Now?」
Marika
『Mhm... Now.』
％Ｂ
「Through the screen?」
Marika
『I-Is it.. weird?』
％Ｂ
「No, it's not. Not weird at all. 'Cause... I wanna kiss you too, Marika.」

Marika
『Oh... Th-Then...』
％Ｂ
「Yeah... Let's kiss.」
％Ｂ
「C'mon... bring your lips this way. We're gonna match the timing up.」
Marika
『Okay...』
％Ｂ
「Mmmh...」
Marika
『Mmmh... Chu.』
％Ｂ
「Marika! Your forehead! Again!」
Marika
『A-Aahhh... What am I doing～』
Marika
『It's because, it's because, your lips were right there... so it was only natural.』

％Ｂ
「You gotta make sure you point them toward the camera, all right?」
Marika
『O-One more time, please!』
％Ｂ
「Okay, here we go.」
％Ｂ
「...Mmh...」
Marika
『Mmmh... Chu.』
Marika
『Hehe...』
％Ｂ
「H-How was that?」
Marika
『Umm... The camera was cold.』
％Ｂ
「W-Well... Yeah, that makes sense...」
Marika
『But... I could feel something warm too.』
％Ｂ
「Marika...」
Marika
『Thank you... That made me happy.』
％Ｂ
「Me too. It's weird, my heart feels all full now. I bet tomorrow's gonna be a good day.」


Marika
『I-I don't think it works like a good luck charm～』
％Ｂ
「Oh no. I'm sure it does.」
Marika
『G-Geez～』
％Ｂ
「Hey, Marika. When I see you next time... Can I kiss you directly?」

Marika
『Oh, of course! I want you to! And besides... maybe it does work like a good luck charm...』

Marika
『I want to kiss you... lots.』
Marika
『W-Wah～ ...My mom's not watching, is she? She's going to tell me to go get married tomorrow or something...』

％Ｂ
「Th-That'd be moving a bit fast, yeah.」
Marika
『Y-Yeah, it'd be too sudden...』
％Ｂ
「...Mm. But.」
％Ｂ
「I'm... definitely gonna pass that exam this month.」
Marika
『Oh...』
％Ｂ
「So...」
Marika
『Mhm.』
I don't say anything more.
She understands exactly what I mean.
Marika
『Do your best studying. I'm completely fine. I'll be waiting.』

％Ｂ
「You sure? You're not lonely?」
Marika
『This is nothing. After all... I waited seven years back then.』

％Ｂ
「Oh...」
Marika
『So... I'm completely fine.』
％Ｂ
「Man... All I ever do is make you wait for me, huh.」
Marika
『It's okay. I'm a woman who can wait for her man.』

She smiles jokingly.
But she's telling the truth.
And that's why... I gotta get to her as soon as I can.
％Ｂ
「It'll be for just a little longer... So wait for me, okay?」
Marika
『Okay!』
