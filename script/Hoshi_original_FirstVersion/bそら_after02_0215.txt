Shuuichi
「Huh, this is a pretty classy office. A bit small, though.」
It's the middle of February. Shuuichi's come to the office to formally commission the design of his new home.

％Ｂ
「Please, have a seat here.」
Shuuichi
「Oh? Sure...」
％Ｂ
「Would you like to have coffee?」
Shuuichi
「Y-Yeah...」
all
I pour a cup of coffee and slide it over to Shuuichi.
％Ｂ
「Thank you very much for coming to our firm in person to discuss your commission.」

Shuuichi
「Oh, yes, and likewise, thank you very much for making the time to discuss this when you're so busy... I mean, no, knock it off! What the hell's with that tone? You doing that on purpose?」


％Ｂ
「...You are a very precious customer to us, Nirasawa-sama. It is only common courtesy to treat you politely.」

Shuuichi
「Uuughh... You're making my hair stand on end. Stop talking like that!」
％Ｂ
「I'm sorry, but I cannot mix my private affairs with work. This would be my way of making that distinction clear.」

Shuuichi
「Then it's a request from your client. Please, anything but the formal speech!」
％Ｂ
「...Fine. This good?」
Shuuichi
「Yeah. Now we can finally have a conversation.」
％Ｂ
「Anyway, you seriously wanna commission me to design your house?」
Shuuichi
「Yeah. If I'm gonna have a house built, then I'd want it to be done by someone I can trust. It's a once-in-a-lifetime purchase.」

％Ｂ
「That definitely gets me motivated, then. Anyway, tell me how exactly you ended up deciding to have a house built.」


Shuuichi
「The plot's going to be where Kaori's grandma used to live. Though they apparently tore the house down when she passed away three years ago.」


Shuuichi
「Her parents apparently want to have a new house built on the plot for Kaori and me to live in, because it'd be a waste to not do anything with it.」


％Ｂ
「All right. I get what's going on, then.」
Shuuichi
「About how much is it going to cost?」
％Ｂ
「That's up to how big the plot is, and what you want.」
Shuuichi
「That's a fair point.」
％Ｂ
「...So what kinda house are you thinking of?」
Shuuichi
「Well it's gotta be a capital-L Love Nest where Kaori and I can fully enjoy our newlywed lives.」

％Ｂ
「That's too vague...」
Shuuichi
「I don't know too well myself. I've never had a house built before.」

％Ｂ
「That's a good point... Well, I guess we'll just have to discuss to figure out the concept.」


Shuuichi
「You'll take the job?」
％Ｂ
「...Yeah. It's a commission from someone I've been friends with since grade school. There's no way I wouldn't.」

％Ｂ
「I'll formally accept the commission to design a new home for the Nirasawa family.」
Shuuichi
「All right! I'm counting on you!」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, leave it to me!」
Shuuichi extends his hand, and I shake it hard.
Shuuichi
「With a discount for friends!」
％Ｂ
「We'll discuss that on another occasion.」
Our handshake continues... as our grips become noticeably firmer.
