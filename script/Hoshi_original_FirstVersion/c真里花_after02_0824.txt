「Let's see... Oh, right, I'm not done with this either.」
Azuma
「Heeey, I'm gonna head out soon.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, yes! See you again tomorrow!」
Azuma
「You're not leaving yet, Hino?」
Azuma
「You're not leaving yet?」
％Ｂ
「I'm sorry, but I'll be here a little longer. There's something I'd like to get done today.」

Azuma
「That's a newlywed for you. So driven.」
％Ｂ
「I have to get it together, after all. And there's the Oono residence case, too.」

Azuma
「Yeah... I hear Oono-san's son is getting married.」
％Ｂ
「Yes, he is. It's rather sudden, what with his girlfriend apparently getting pregnant...」

That doesn't really matter to me.
But the issue is that they've suddenly asked if we could add another room onto the plan so their son and his wife could live with them.

We managed to modify the design to include the extra room...

But construction's already started, so there are several things that would need to be redone if we were to make changes now.

Azuma
「What'd the contractor say?」
％Ｂ
「That it was ridiculous.」
Azuma
「Yeah, figured. It was supposed to be finished by the end of summer.」

％Ｂ
「Yes, it'd be difficult to extend the construction period any longer. For budget's sake, too...」

This change of plans would stretch our budget too.
If the construction takes any longer, then it'll be even worse.
Oono-san wouldn't want things to be any more expensive than they already are either.
We'll have to keep cost increases to a minimum.
％Ｂ
「So I'm going to spend a little more time thinking of something.」
Azuma
「I see. Pretty rough on you right after your wedding. I bet you wanna hurry up and go home so you can eat your bride's cooking.」

％Ｂ
「I really do, but...」
Azuma
「If you're going to be late, then make sure you let her know. I'm going, but remember. All things in moderation.」

％Ｂ
「Yes. Thank you very much.」
all
I'm left alone once Azuma-san leaves.
％Ｂ
「I'll let Marika know, and then put in a bit more work.」
％Ｂ
「...I'm home...」
It's really late.
Marika's probably asleep, since I told her I'd be home late. I tiptoe through the door.

Marika
「Welcome home～」
Or so I thought, but Marika comes running up to welcome me.
Marika
「Ehehe...」
％Ｂ
「I'm home, Marika.」
Marika
「Mmm... chu.」
She puts her arms on my shoulders and kisses me.
It's been our daily ritual ever since we got married.
％Ｂ
「You're still awake?」
Marika
「No, I actually fell asleep a bit earlier... I'm sorry.」

She looks embarrassed.
So she was trying to stay up for me...
％Ｂ
「I should be the one apologizing. Sorry for being late.」

Marika
「No, I'm sure you're tired after work. Did you eat dinner already?」

％Ｂ
「Oh, no, not yet.」
Marika
「I'll get it ready right away, then. I have it in the fridge♪」

％Ｂ
「Nah, I'll do that myself. You can sleep, you know. You're tired, aren't you?」


Marika
「Whaaat? I don't want toooo. Sleeping by myself is lonely.」

％Ｂ
「O-Oh, okay...」
Marika
「And I want to talk about stuff just a bit. I didn't get to talk to you much at all this morning.」

Marika
「I'm sure you're tired too, Ryousuke... but could you let me be with you?」

Marika
「I'm sure you're tired too... but could you let me be with you?」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, of course!」
Marika
「Yaaay! Oh, should I get some beer～?」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, please.」
Marika
「I'll get some right away, then!」
all
％Ｂ
「...She's so cute.」
I know she's my wife, but man.
I am one lucky guy.
Marika
「Here you gooo. Here's the beer you love!」

She's grabbed a 350-mL can from the fridge.
There's a white vapor coming off of it. Must be well chilled.
Marika
「Here's your glass.」
％Ｂ
「Ohh... It's kinda cold?」
Marika
「I was keeping it in the fridge. Beer tastes better this way, right?」

Marika
「I will now open the beeer. Nnnh...」

％Ｂ
「Oh? Are you gonna be able to open it today?」
Marika
「I can do it! Nnnh... Hup!」

all
She applies a bit of force and opens the pulltab.
I hear a "Pshh," and eventually I can smell the fragrant beer.

％Ｂ
「Opening beer isn't your strong suit, huh.」
Marika's not too strong, and on top of that, she apparently has soft nails, so it's apparently pretty arduous for her to open pulltabs.

Marika
「But there's really hard-to-open ones sometimes, so I don't know about those...」

Marika
「I bought hot milk tea once during the winter and I just couldn't open it, so it was just a hand warmer for me until I got home.」

％Ｂ
「R-Really now... Just tell me if I'm around. I'll open it for you.」


Marika
「Okay! I'll count on you then!」
Marika
「I'll pour the beer then, okay?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. Thanks.」
She slowly pours the beer.
It's a perfect pour, with just the right amount of bubbles.
％Ｂ
「Ngh, ngh, ngh... Pfaaah! Aaahh～ ...Delicious!」

Marika
「Ahahahaha, that looked like it was good～」
Marika
「Men really make it look like the beer they're drinking is delicious.」
％Ｂ
「Well yeah, 'cause it is...」
I wonder just when I started thinking it was good.
I feel like I just drank it without really thinking about the flavor back in university...
％Ｂ
「I guess it just means I'm an adult now.」
Marika
「I'm so jealous～ Maybe I'll try drinking a bit too...」

％Ｂ
「Oh, wanna go for it?」
Marika
「Mhm. Please share just a bit with me.」
％Ｂ
「Here you go, then.」
I hold the glass out toward her.
Marika
「Wah～ ...Thank you～ ...Nkh.」
She takes just a single sip.
She pretty much just lapped at it with her tongue.
Marika
「Mmm...」
She doesn't look too pleased...
Marika
「...Bitter.」
％Ｂ
「Don't like it too much?」
Marika
「Mm, it was an adult flavor...」
Marika really can't stomach alcohol.
She can drink sweet cocktails, but she probably can't have too many of those, either.

Marika
「I'm just going to watch you drink instead.」
Marika
「It makes me happy just watching you enjoy it.」

％Ｂ
「You sure? Then...」
Marika
「Yeees, I'll pour more beer～」
She pours me another glass.
It's another clean pour.
％Ｂ
「Ngh, ngh, ngh... Pfaaah!」
Marika
「Wow～ ...That looked tasty!」
％Ｂ
「Man, this is some good stuff.」
Marika
「Hehe... Oh, I'll go heat up the food, then.」
all
She goes about preparing dinner.
She brings over some warmed-up cooking after a little bit.
Marika
「I tried making cabbage rolls today.」
％Ｂ
「Whoa, this is amazing...」
I see neatly wrapped rolls of cabbage.
The rolls float elegantly in a tomato sauce.
Marika
「I've never made them before, so please let me know if you like them～」
％Ｂ
「Oh, they'll be good for sure. Let's try them!」
all
％Ｂ
「Ohhhh... This is crazy good!」
Marika
「Oh, thank god～」
Marika
「I tried adding a little extra pepper to the meat. Because you said you liked it on the spicier side, so...」

％Ｂ
「So you made this according to my preferences?」
Marika
「It's an everyday meal, so of course I'd want you to enjoy it.」

Marika
「I'll add these cabbage rolls to my repertoire, then♪」
Marika's just getting better and better at cooking.
People at work invite me to go out drinking with them every now and then, but honestly, I just wanna go straight home every day.

％Ｂ
「Getting to eat this after a long day at work's the best. I had so much to do today...」

Marika
「Did something happen at work?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, it's the Oono residence case... Their son's apparently gonna get married and move in with them.」

Marika
「What? That's sudden.」
％Ｂ
「It's apparently because the son's girlfriend got pregnant.」
％Ｂ
「So they've been asking us if we can modify the house plan... so I'm doing all that stuff right now.」

Marika
「Oh really... Well, you can't say no to your children, right?」
％Ｂ
「I'm actually surprised, since Oono-san doesn't seem too annoyed about it.」
％Ｂ
「I heard he didn't have the best relationship with his son, but I guess you just can't predict these kinds of things.」

Marika
「I'm sure that your own children always look cute to you.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, it's gotta be something like that.」
Marika
「I take care of kids every day... and I feel like a mom like that too sometimes.」

％Ｂ
「Really...」
Marika
「...M-Mhm.」
The conversation stumbles a bit.
There's something about talking about kids that makes me think.
And it looks like Marika's the same way.
％Ｂ
「...Hey, Marika.」
Marika
「Y-Yes?」
％Ｂ
「When it comes to having kids... Uhh... I wonder how people go about it, timing-wise.」

Marika
「Oh～ ...Th-That's a good question～」
％Ｂ
「You're working too... so I guess we don't need to rush things so much?」

Marika
「Y-Yeah, I think so too.」
Marika
「It looks like you're busy with work right now too... so eventually...」
％Ｂ
「Yeah... Eventually.」
This topic's kinda embarrassing to talk about.
'Cause we're pretty much asking, "When do we wanna have sex with that in mind?"
But there's no need for us to rush.
It's still only been a month since we became husband and wife...
％Ｂ
「How about you? How was your day?」
Marika
「Yeah, we did a rehearsal for the play today. And then～」

all
Marika apparently had a full day too.
I'm really happy to see her happily recount her day to me like this.

Marika
「Oh, I might've started complaining a bit too much. Sorry for talking about stuff like this～」

％Ｂ
「It's totally fine. I wanna hear everything about you. We both work, so the amount of time we get to spend together on weekdays is limited... and I come home late every day. Sorry.」


Marika
「It's okay. It's for work.」
％Ｂ
「I'll listen to you complain as much as you want. If you want something, then just tell me, all right? I'll do anything I can.」


Marika
「Mmm, there's nothing I really want specifically... but I do want a bit of attention.」

％Ｂ
「Attention?」
Marika
「Mhm.」
all
She smiles brightly, walks around the table, and sits down next to me.\n\r

She leans against me.
Marika
「Ehehe. I'm stuck.」
％Ｂ
「You're like a kid.」
Marika
「Ahaha, this is a bit impolite of me when you're eating～ Am I in the way～?」

％Ｂ
「Not at all. I think it's fine, since it's just us two.」
Getting to feel Marika's warmth and softness in the cool air conditioning is nice.\n\r

And she smells really good.
％Ｂ
「Is that your shampoo I smell?」
Marika
「Whaaat～? ...I haven't taken a bath yet. Oh, but I did spray on some antiperspirant, so it might be that...」


％Ｂ
「Wanna take a bath together afterward?」
Marika
「Oh, that sounds nice～ ...Ahaha... It's a bit embarrassing, though.」

％Ｂ
「You don't need to be embarrassed at this point, do you?」
Marika
「It's embarrassing when it's bright... Fuah...」

She stifles a yawn. Looks like she's getting sleepy.
％Ｂ
「Oh... You can go to sleep if you're tired, you know.」
Marika
「Oh, no, I'm fine. This is just comfy... Fuauh...」

What a cute yawn.
She's nodding off against me. Looks like she really is tired.
Marika
「I'm getting all sleepy...」
She twists.
Her skirt flips upward, letting me see her underwear.
That looks familiar...
％Ｂ
「Oh, isn't that underwear... what you wore on our wedding day?」
Marika
「Huh? Oh, you saw it～?」
She tries to hide it a bit, but I can still see it.

Marika
「I thought I'd wear them every now and then, since I bought them and all... It's just the bottom, though. The top's really tight.」

％Ｂ
「Huh, is that how it is?」
The fact that I can only see a little glimpse of her underwear's kind of even more erotic.
I guess I just get hornier when I'm tired...
％Ｂ
「Marika...」
I turn her toward me and kiss her gently.
Marika
「Anh... Nh... hauh... It tastes like beer...」

She smiles impishly.
Marika
「I think I might get drunk...」
％Ｂ
「What? With just that much?」
Marika
「It might be just a little for you, Ryousuke... but it's a lot for me.」

Marika
「It might be just a little for you... but it's a lot for me.」

Marika
「But... they say you get a little bolder when you're drunk, don't they? Maybe it'll make me okay with embarrassing things...?」

Her eyes are already damp with arousal.
I think she's already completely turned on.
％Ｂ
「Marika... How about we kiss some more, then?」
Marika
「Mhm...」
When we move to press our lips together again...
all
％Ｂ
「Oh...」
My phone rings.
It's from one of my senior coworkers.
Marika
「Is it a call for work?」
％Ｂ
「Probably... Sorry.」
all
What bad timing. I answer.
％Ｂ
「Yes, hello?」
Firm Staff A
『Hello? Hino? Sorry for calling so late.』
Firm Staff A
『Sorry for calling so late.』
％Ｂ
「Oh, no. Is something the matter?」
Firm STaff A
『I've got some materials that I need to get together for a presentation tomorrow, so I wanted some advice. It's the same kind of thing as the Oono residence, so I wanted your opinion on it.』


％Ｂ
「Oh, okay. If you think it would be useful.」
Firm Staff A
『I wanna talk on FaceTalk. You good for that?』
％Ｂ
「Ah... I understand.」
This is gonna take a while...
％Ｂ
（Sorry. I think this'll be a while.）
I tell Marika with just my eyes.
She knows me well enough to understand immediately.
Marika
（I'll go to sleep without you, then.）
％Ｂ
（All right. I'll do the dishes.）
Marika
（Thanks. Good night～）
She smiles mischievously, and kisses the cheek opposite the one I'm holding my phone up to.

Marika
（Next time, okay? We can do it anytime we want, now that we're married.）

％Ｂ
「Ye...Yeah.」
all
She smiles mischievously again, and disappears into the bedroom.
Crap. That just got me more turned on.
Firm Staff A
『Hey? Something wrong?』
％Ｂ
「Oh no, it's nothing. Anyway, I'll hang up and recall you on FaceTalk.」

Firm Staff A
『Sorry about this, and thanks～ We'll go out sometime, my treat!』

％Ｂ
「You always say that, but you never follow through.」
Firm Staff A
『No, no. I'm serious this time. Thanks!』
