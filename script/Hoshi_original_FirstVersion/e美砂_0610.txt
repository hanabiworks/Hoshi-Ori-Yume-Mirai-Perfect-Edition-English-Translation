「Good morning, Narusawa.」
Rikka
「...Good morning.」
％Ｂ
「There's something I wanna ask your opinion on. Is that okay?」
Rikka
「...What?」
％Ｂ
「Like I said, I want your opinion on something.」
Rikka
「You want my opinion... That sure is sudden.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, well, I don't really have that much time, so I figured it'd be best to try to do things as quickly as possible.」

Rikka
「...Fine, I'll hear what you have to say. Tell me.」

all
I tell her about what the naturalist and astronomy clubs want to do for the Tanabata Festival.
％Ｂ
「So I want both of them to succeed, even though we don't have much time or manpower. Do you have any ideas for how we could do that?」


Rikka
「...Is this really something you should be asking me about at all?」
％Ｂ
「Well, you came camping with us.」
Rikka
「I did, but why does that mean I need to give you my opinion?」
％Ｂ
「We're friends that ate food from the same pot together. Don't you wanna help people who have that close of a relationship with you?」

Rikka
「...Not really.」
％Ｂ
「That's right, you would! That's what they call empathy!」

Rikka
「...You're being very forceful.」
％Ｂ
「Also, you seem like you're smart, so I'm expecting good ideas from you.」

Rikka
「I wish you wouldn't just expect things from me like that... But okay, fine. I'll give you one piece of advice if that's the case.」


％Ｂ
「Sure. That'd be great.」
Rikka
「You should give up on getting them both to succeed and focus on just one or the other.」

Rikka
「If I were told to go learn two pieces by tomorrow, I think I'd practice so I could play one of them perfectly, instead of learning to play two pieces at a mediocre level.」

％Ｂ
「I see...」
That's about as pragmatic as I was expecting from her.
％Ｂ
「Isn't there some kinda really great way to make use of the latest in musical theory as a method to really compress how much work we can do in a short amount of time?」

Rikka
「Of course not.」
％Ｂ
「Oh... Okay.」
Rikka
「...B-But... Um... I-I can give advice as... a friend... who's eaten food from the same pot as you...」


％Ｂ
「Yeah?」
Rikka
「Even if you do end up telling one of them that they won't be able to do what they want, I don't think they'll get angry or hate you for it.」

Rikka
「Because I'm sure they know that you did everything you could for their sakes.」

％Ｂ
「Narusawa...」
Rikka
「Though it's not like I know those two that well anyway. I'd say you're the one who'd know better about what kinds of people they are.」


％Ｂ
「I'd know better...」
all
Is that true?
Do I understand those two?
％Ｂ
「No...」
...That's right... I still don't really know them that well.
Both Okihara-senpai, and Ousaka...
I know what they do.
And I know how they feel about what they do.
But I don't know why they're that passionate.
I don't know what they find attractive about their passions.
I might not know anything at all...
％Ｂ
「I get it. I get it now...」
％Ｂ
「Thanks, Narusawa! I think that's ended up being a huge hint!」
Rikka
「I-I didn't really... I just stated the obvious. It isn't a big deal.」

％Ｂ
「No, this was really helpful!」
Rikka
「Well, if that's the case... then that's good. Also, don't get so excited... It's embarrassing.」


％Ｂ
「Oh? Well aren't you the shy one.」
It was good to ask for her opinion.
I'm gonna do a little more research.
I go to the old school building during lunch break.
The door to the hallway connecting to the building isn't locked.
Which means that, most likely, Yukimura's―
Touko
「Touch.」
％Ｂ
「Uhiiihh!?」
I let out a weird-sounding scream in response to a sudden cold sensation at my neck.
Touko
「Ahahah! "Uhiiihh"! What was that? A scream?」
％Ｂ
「Y-Yukimura!?」
The can of coffee in her hand shakes as she laughs.
％Ｂ
「It-It was 'cause you surprised me.」
Touko
「Sorry, sorry. I didn't think you'd freak out that much. "Uhiiihh"... Pff!」

It hasn't even been a minute since I've seen her today and I've already done something uncool...
Touko
「So, what are you here for today?」
％Ｂ
「Don't you check LIME at all? I sent you a message before coming.」

Touko
「Oh, sorry about that. I didn't see it at all.」
She pulls out her phone.
Touko
「Ack. 35 notifications.」
％Ｂ
「...You should look at your phone at least occasionally.」
Touko
「Seeing unread message notifications kinda makes me not wanna read them. Let's see, oh, this one. Mmm... You want my opinion on something?」


She's looking at the message I sent.
％Ｂ
「Yeah. I asked Narusawa for hers this morning, and I wanted to get more than one.」

Touko
「Sure. It's not like I have anything better to do. I'll open up my advice corner for you, then.」

I follow her into one of the classrooms.
％Ｂ
「By the way, where'd you get these chairs and desks from?」
Touko
「I found them in the storage. They've been cleaned, so they're fine to sit on.」

She sits down in a chair, opens the coffee, and happily begins drinking.

Touko
「So... what'd you want my opinion for?」
％Ｂ
「Right... Here's what's going on―」
all
％Ｂ
「And Narusawa told me that it wouldn't be possible to get them both to succeed.」

I told her the exact same thing, as well as Narusawa's opinion.
％Ｂ
「What do you think?」
Touko
「Mmm... Well, I think I have a different opinion.」
Touko
「I think it's fine to do both. It doesn't really matter if they don't come out that well. It's just a student display anyway, so no one's expecting much anyway.」


％Ｂ
「But... there's no point if we're just going to half-ass it.」
Touko
「Why's that? Isn't this one of those things that people do because there's meaning to doing it at all, without really caring about the details?」


％Ｂ
「Hmm...」
I guess there's that point of view too.
Touko
「I don't really think you need to think that hard about it.」
She casually drinks some more of her coffee.
But it does seem like she thought her answer through, at least to some extent.
Touko
「So is that all you wanted my opinion on?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah... That's all.」
Touko
「What? I thought you were really at your wit's end to come all the way over here to talk to me.」

％Ｂ
「Well, I am thinking this over pretty seriously.」
Touko
「So then why don't you ask someone who's more relevant, instead of someone like me?」

％Ｂ
「Nah, you're not irrelevant.」
Touko
「Huh? Why?」
％Ｂ
「'Cause we all went camping together.」
Touko
「Huh... I didn't expect that. You know, I think I might give a bit more of a serious answer then, just this once.」

％Ｂ
「Oh?」
Touko
「It's not really that big of a deal either way, though. Hmm, well you know, in the end... Isn't it all just about what's most important?」


Touko
「It won't be fun if you end up with something that's so-so everywhere. I think I'd like something that's got a hundred in just one thing, even if everything else is a zero.」


Touko
「I don't think you need to try that hard. Just get that one thing across.」

％Ｂ
「I get it... Thanks! I'm glad I asked you.」

Touko
「It's not a big deal. It's kind of embarrassing to have someone thank me face to face like that.」

all
I'm starting to get the picture.
I should talk with those two.
After school.
I had Ousaka and Shinozaki come with me to meet up with Okihara-senpai in the second chemistry classroom.

Misa
「And so, what did you wish to discuss with us?」
％Ｂ
「I would like to gather information on your activities.」
Misa
「What? ...Gather information?」
Marika
「...What do you mean by that?」
all
％Ｂ
「It's something that came to mind while I was thinking about preparing for the Tanabata Festival. I'd like to really understand your clubs' activities.」


Marika
「But you already know what they―」
％Ｂ
「I know what their clubs do, of course. And I know how passionate they are about their activities too.」

％Ｂ
「But you and I haven't experienced anything about what makes those activities fun or interesting, right?」

Marika
「Well... That's... true.」
all
％Ｂ
「And so I'd like you two to teach us about what it is that makes the sea and stars that you know so interesting!」


％Ｂ
「That way, I think we'd be able to understand what would be most important for the sake of making an aquarium or planetarium... Would that be okay?」

Okihara-senpai and Ousaka look at each other.
Misa
「I see, I see. There are almost too many options to pick from to have you experience it. What do you think, Ousaka-san?」


Sora
「...Fine by me.」
Misa
「If so, then I shall also think of something.」
％Ｂ
「Thank you very much. How about this weekend, then?」

Misa
「This weekend...」
Sora
「...We meet in front of the train station at 11 a.m. on Saturday.」
Marika
「Wha, that was fast!?」
all
％Ｂ
「That's fine with me, but what about you, Shinozaki?」
Marika
「I definitely want to participate too, if that's what we're doing. I'm interested too.」

all
％Ｂ
「What about you, Okihara-senpai? Perhaps another day would work better?」

Misa
「Mmm... Well...」
Huh? ...She's frowning a bit...
Wait, are we being bothersome...?
Misa
「I will participate... but would it be acceptable for me to defer announcing what exactly I will be showing you until the day of?」


％Ｂ
「Y-Yes... That's fine, of course.」
Misa
「I will think of something by then... I apologize for the delay.」
