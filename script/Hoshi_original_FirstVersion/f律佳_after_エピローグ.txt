―The melody of happiness.
The unending sound of the piano, and laughter.
％Ｂ
「Rikka's piano is always so soothing.」
They're right when they say family is comfort.
I can immediately re-energize my tired heart and body after a day of work.
Every day is filled with happiness.
％Ｂ
「Oh, I think it's about time to flip them.」
I grab a spatula and flip over the ground beef steaks in the pan.
It's a little before noon on the weekend.
I'm standing in the kitchen, getting lunch ready.
This is my way of doing something for the family after I suddenly got busy after getting my first-class architect qualification.

％Ｂ
「Still, I can't believe they actually ended up being twins...」
―The house that we would be living in, ten years from then.
The house that Rikka and I thought of together―is the house our family lives in now.
It's a brand-new house we built only just this summer.
We had to move our plans forward by a lot.
Rikka
「Ryousuke... Um, you see, we made a baby! Ehehe, they congratulated me at the doctor's!」
Rikka
「...Um, you see, we made a baby! Ehehe, they congratulated me at the doctor's!」
Rikka's pregnancy announcement filled us with incredible joy, but also with utter confusion about everything I'd be doing for the first time.
And that's where my parents stepped in to help.
They were familiar with the entire process, after giving birth to and raising me.
Especially my mom, who supported Rikka as a fellow woman as she experienced problems and doubts during her first pregnancy.
I don't think I've ever been more grateful to my parents in my whole life.
The firm and the people I've come to know through work helped us out a lot when we were building this house too.

We had been living in the same apartment as before, but we knew things would get cramped once the kids became grade school age and beyond.
And so we figured we might as well just build a house if we were planning on moving out of the apartment eventually anyway.

We were able to build it for impressively little with the business connections I had made and some industry friends Mr. Azuma introduced me to.
But it still wasn't a sum I could pay entirely after only a few years of working, which meant I had to take out loans to fund most of it...
But now I'm working every day under Mr. Azuma's watchful eye.
Rikka
「Now, Ayane, Sakine. You'll fall off the chair and get hurt like that. Sit properly next to Mama.」
Ayane
「It's fiiine!」
Sakine
「Fine, fiiine, awawawawah!」
Ayane
「Awawah, I-I'm falliiing!」
Rikka
「Geez... See, that's why I warned you. You can hang onto me, so sit still.」
Ayane
「I'm sorryyy.」
Sakine
「I'm sorryyy.」
％Ｂ
「Hahahah.」
I can't help but grin when I see all the smiles in this household.
I'm smack dab in the middle of happiness.
Ayane
「Hey, Mamaaa.」
Rikka
「Hm? What is it?」
Ayane
「Your piano playing's really pretty.」
Rikka
「Hehehe, thank you. My piano playing is pretty because all of you are here for me.」

Ayane
「Mmm?」
Sakine
「Mmm?」
They tilt their heads in unison.
They're absolutely adorable.
Rikka
「It means I love you soooo much!」
I pull them close with both hands and hug them tight.
Ayane
「Eheheeeh...」
Sakine
「Eheheeeeh...」
They cuddle happily with me.
Ayane
「Will I be able to play piano just like you?」
Rikka
「Are you interested in the piano?」
Ayane
「Because your piano's so pretty! And you're so cool when you're playing piano, Mama!」

Sakine
「Me too, me toooo!」
Sakine also determinedly raises her hand.
Rikka
「Oh dear, you too, Sakine? Hehehe, then let's try playing together.」

Rikka
「Try pressing here first.」
Ayane
「It made a sound!」
Rikka
「Try pressing here next.」
Sakine
「It's a different sound!」
Ayane
「But it's not pretty like when you do it...」
Rikka
「Ehehe. You two will be able to play like me if you practice lots.」

Sakine
「Really!?」
Rikka
「Mhm. Really.」
Ayane
「I'm going to practice lots and lots!」
Sakine
「Lots and lots!」
％Ｂ
「Rikkaaa! Lunch is almost ready!」
Rikka
「Okaaay! Be right there, dear!」
I can hear my beloved husband's voice―Ryousuke's voice―\nfrom the dining room.

Rikka
「Papa's calling for us. Let's clean up and have lunch.」
Ayane
「I wanna play piano mooore!」
Sakine
「I wanna plaaay!」
Rikka
「Hehe, then how about this? We can play with the piano again if you finish lunch without leaving anything on your plates.」

Ayane
「Let's eeeat!」
Sakine
「Eeeat!」
Rikka
「But don't eat too fast, okay? You have to eat slowly and chew lots. Understood?」

Ayane
「Okaaay.」
Sakine
「Okaaay.」
Rikka
「Let's wash our hands and make them sparkly clean, then.」
Ayane
「Sparkly haaands!」
Sakine
「Rub rub the soooap!」
Rikka
『My world... A world for just me alone.』
Rikka
『A world where I don't have to associate with anyone. A world that's complete with just me. A world of my own fabrication.』
Rikka
『And then someone strange barged in. I thought he was irritating, but he just melted into my world, as if it were only natural...』

Rikka
『My world... A world where I used to be alone.』
Rikka
『A world where I'm connected with everyone. A world that goes on and on and on. A world of our own creation.』

Rikka
『My sound is still expanding...』
Rikka
『―And so is my world.』
