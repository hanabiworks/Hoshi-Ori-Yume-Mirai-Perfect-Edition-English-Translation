Meguru
「Oh! Senpai!」
Meguru-chan's face lights up when I open the door to the music room, and she comes running over to me.


Rikka looks at me the same way, with a warm smile.
I asked the two of them earlier to come to the music room.
Meguru
「Onee-chan and I are going to be playing piano four hands for the Shio-cademy Fest!」
％Ｂ
「So I've heard.」
Rikka told me over the phone last night.
Rikka
「We've decided to play "A Fragment of Emotion."」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, I think that's a great choice.」
It's this city's Tanabata song, and more importantly, it's a piece that holds a lot of memories for the two of them.
Rikka still regrets saying no to Meguru-chan's request to play it as a duo in the past.

This is the perfect piece to dispel those regrets too.
Meguru
「Thank you so very much! It's all thanks to you, Senpai! And just as we agreed, I'll do anything!」

％Ｂ
「Wha... Meguru-chan! Don't mention that!」
Meguru
「Oh... I'm sorry for saying that with Onee-chan here!」
％Ｂ
「Don't apologiiize!」
That's just gonna make things even weirder!
Rikka
「...You had Meguru promise to do anything for you?」
all
％Ｂ
「Uh... Well... It's more like I was forced to...」
See!? She's weirdly angry now!
％Ｂ
「Just so you know, I didn't try to get you to play piano with Meguru-chan because I wanted her to do something for me, okay?」
Rikka
「I know that. But you did make that promise, didn't you? What were you planning on having her do that you didn't want to mention in front of me?」

％Ｂ
「I would never do anything like what you're imagining!」
Rikka
「What I'm imagining? What might that be?」
I'm screwed!
And it's too late.
If I say it, she's definitely gonna either look at me like I'm garbage or get angry at me. I can't say it.
％Ｂ
「I'm very sorry.」
Rikka
「Sigh... You don't need to say it. It's you, so I'm sure it was something dirty.」

％Ｂ
「Ghh...」
Any guy would imagine something like that after hearing "whatever you want"!


Meguru
「Huh!? Senpai, you were planning on having me do something dirty!?」

Meguru
「Uuuh... I would feel bad for Onee-chan, and I don't have any kind of experience like that, so... I'd like you to request something else. Please forgive me.」
Rikka
「Why not forgive her?」
％Ｂ
「I would like to be the one forgiven already...」
I raise the white flag of surrender before the two sisters.
all
Rikka
「So? Why are we here today?」
％Ｂ
「Right. You'll see in a second.」
all
The door opens. Perfect timing.
An older girl with a bun and glasses wearing a school uniform walks in with several other female students in tow.

？？？
「Ohoooh～ Nufufu... Looks like they're both here. Let's have fun today, okay♪」

％Ｂ
「Yes, thank you very much for coming.」
She approaches Rikka and Meguru-chan and starts looking them over hungrily.

Rikka
「Who... are these people? They feel even crazier than Segawa-san does when she has her camera out...」

Meguru
「Uuuh... Onee-chaaan～」
The two of them inch backward.
？？？
「I like it, I like it... It really stimulates the imagination. Then let's start with...」

Fwip!!
Meguru
「Eeek!?」
Meguru-chan gives a start when she suddenly pulls something out.

Rikka
「...Measuring tape?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. This is the handicrafts club. I was thinking of having them make outfits for you two for the Shio-cademy Fest.」

Handicrafts Club President
「The handicrafts club... We did away with that obsolete name a long time ago. We are now known as... the cos club!!」

Meguru
「...The cos club?」
％Ｂ
「They're apparently specialized in making costumes. They say they make a lot of outfits for anime and manga especially.」

％Ｂ
「Meguru-chan, you should've heard about this from the concert team when you got the invitation...」

Meguru
「Yes. I had heard that an outfit would be provided. So this is what they meant.」

Rikka
「Meguru's one thing, but I think it might be too much work to do it for me too. We don't have much time, so I'm fine just playing in my school uniform.」

Handicrafts Club President
「What are you saying, Narusawa-san!? Are you saying you won't let us make your outfit!?」

all
Rikka
「Eek...」
Rikka takes another step back as the handicraft club president's face looms before her.
％Ｂ
「She actually was the one who requested to make your outfit too.」

Rikka
「Wh-Why...?」
Handicrafts Club President
「Isn't it obvious!? Does one need a reason to create!? No, one does not!!」

Handicrafts Club President
「I've been watching you all this time, Narusawa-san! Hahh, hahh... That silky black hair, those well-proportioned facial features, those slender proportions... Aaahh, I want my clothes on you!!」
Rikka
「This person's... a bit scary.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, I was kinda surprised by this passion at first too. But she's apparently won the grand prize for some kinda school uniform decoration contest, so she's got the skills.」

Handicrafts Club President
「I'll create an outfit that's much more perfect for you than any simple designer could! I'll pack in everything I've learned from observing you for the last year and three months!」
％Ｂ
「Haha... Good for you, huh? You've got yourself a real passionate designer now...」
Rikka
「You're only saying that because you're not in my position here...」
Rikka
「But yes... It would be strange if Meguru were the only one wearing a dress for our performance. So if you're willing to make an outfit for me, then please.」
Handicrafts Club President
「I'm so looking forward to working with you, Narusawa-san! Let's make this into the perfect show!!」
Rikka
「Y-Yes... I can trust this person, right? She won't make a weird outfit or anything?」

％Ｂ
「Probably not...」
Handicraft Club President
「Now let's start by taking measurements! Okay everyone, close the curtains. The men should leave.」

all
％Ｂ
「Haha...」
I can't help but laugh.
I heard that Rikka and Meguru-chan had cleared things up between the two of them, but actually seeing them act the way they did puts my heart at ease.

Rikka's apparently going to start practicing together with Meguru-chan tomorrow.
Ishizuka-san said she'd reduce Rikka's workload to make time for practice, but Rikka told her that she still wanted to do her fair share of the work.
She'll be managing her time between work and practice.
It's an incredibly Rikka-like answer.
Meguru-chan seemed to think the same thing.
％Ｂ
「All right. Time for me to do my own work too.」
I head toward the second chemistry classroom, filled with energy and motivation after seeing Rikka's smile.
