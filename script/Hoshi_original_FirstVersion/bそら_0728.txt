We're finally starting on the actual preparations for the Tanabata Festival todayーthe construction of the planetarium dome.

％Ｂ
「Let's split up into two groups before we get started. One group will cut out the parts, and the other will paint the parts that have been cut out.」

Touko
「Are we deciding with rock paper scissors again?」
％Ｂ
「No, we've got the groups decided already. The group cutting out the parts is gonna be me, Sora, and Narusawa.」

all
％Ｂ
「The painting group's gonna be Shinozaki, Segawa, Yukimura, and Okihara-senpai.」

Misa
「Understood.」
Natsuki
「What was the thought process behind these groups?」
％Ｂ
「The group cutting out the parts is pretty much just the people who were good at doing the same thing for the templates before.」

Natsuki
「Oh, that makes sense. By the way, you sure you don't need someone in charge of taking photos?」

％Ｂ
「It's not like you weren't gonna take them every chance you get anyway, right?」
Natsuki
「Pretty much.」
all
Touko
「By the way, where's Four-Eyes-kun?」
％Ｂ
「Shuuichi's got event committee work, and he needs to go check up on how the other clubs are doing too, so he apparently can't help out too much more than he already has.」


％Ｂ
「I'm grateful he was around for just the cardboard collection.」
I genuinely appreciate all of his help.
％Ｂ
「We'll start cutting out the parts, so could you guys start painting the parts we cut out as soon as we're done?」


Marika
「Roger that～ Leave it to us.」
％Ｂ
「All right, then let's get started!」
all
Sora and I start cutting out the parts using the templates we all worked on.
And as for Narusawa...
Rikka
「...」
She's just staring at the cardboard with the utility knife in hand.

％Ｂ
「What's wrong, Narusawa?」
Rikka
「Do you think you could teach me the trick to cutting cardboard well?」
％Ｂ
「The trick?」
Rikka
「We don't have much extra cardboard, so I want to avoid making any unnecessary mistakes.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, you're right. Thanks. It's not really a trick or anything, but I can just show you how I personally do it.」

Rikka
「That's fine.」
all
I give Narusawa a seminar on how to cut cardboard.
Though it's pretty much the same technique as using the plastic cutter from before.\n\r
Just repeatedly make shallow, careful strokes without trying to cut all the way through in one shot.
％Ｂ
「For the first stroke, just carefully run the blade along the edge of the template. It's fine to go slow. That first stroke'll make a groove for the blade to run through for the rest of the strokes.」

％Ｂ
「Oh, and you should change out the knife's blade pretty often. And make sure the blade's as perpendicular as possible to the cardboard. Otherwise, you'll get a mismatched edge on the other side of the cut.」


Rikka
「Okay. I'll try it.」
all
Narusawa's much more of a quick learner than I expected, and she gets the hang of using the utility knife right away.

We cut out part after part after part.
There's a lot we have to cut out, so we don't have the time to go slowly.
Marika
「I'll take the parts that you're done cutting out～」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, thanks.」
all
Shinozaki collects the cut-out pieces of cardboard.
The painting team's working outside the old school building.
The paint'll dry faster out there because of the breeze and the sun.
Marika
「I brought more parts～」

Misa
「Thank you very much. Let's continue painting away, shall we?」
all
Natsuki
「This rolly way of painting's kinda fun～」
Touko
「Hey, I know they said we need to paint both sides white, but wouldn't it be better to paint the inside black? Since we'd need it to be dark inside when it's done.」

Natsuki
「Oh, that's a good point. Is this a mistake?」

Misa
「No, this is fine. The projecting of the stars will be a projection of light, and thus a white background will allow for that much brighter a projection.」


Natsuki
「Hmm...?」
Touko
「What's that mean?」
Marika
「Um... It's the same as why movie theater screens are white, isn't it?」

Misa
「Yes, it is.」
Touko
「Ohh, I get iiit.」
Natsuki
「It's like photo printing paper.」
Everyone's happily working along.
We're planning on taking a full three days to cut out and paint all the parts.

If we rush and do an inexact job, then we'd end up making a deformed dome.
We should be able to put it all together by the end of the month if we keep up a steady pace.
Yeah. I'm sure we'll be fine if we keep this up.
Rikka
「By the way, I think there's supposed to be someone who talks about the stars at a planetarium. Is Ousaka-san going to be doing that?」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, that's the plan.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
Rikka
「I guess that's the logical conclusion, since she knows the most about them. But why just the "plan"?」

％Ｂ
「Well... She's apparently still a bit worried about it. You know, 'cause Sora's on the quiet side.」

Rikka
「...I would say she's on that side, yes.」
％Ｂ
「She's apparently a little worried about whether she'll be able to talk in front of a lot of people.」
Rikka
「...I see. I can empathize.」
％Ｂ
「...You know any tricks or anything for getting over stuff like that?」
Rikka
「Wha... Tricks?」
％Ｂ
「'Cause you play piano, right? I was wondering if you had any tricks for when you play for someone else to hear or something.」


Rikka
「...I only play because I want to play.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, okay... I thought you might have some good advice, though.」

Rikka
「...」
Rikka
「...It's only just something to keep in mind... but you should be conscious of the guests.」

％Ｂ
「Be conscious of them? Not the opposite?」
I hear stuff like how you should pretend the audience is a bunch of pumpkins or you should ignore their gazes to try to not be nervous...

Sora
「...」
Sora looks confused too.
Rikka
「Why would you want to ignore the people you want to have listen to you?」
％Ｂ
「Oh, I see... Yeah, you're right...」
Sora
「...」
Rikka
「I think you should be conscious of what you want them to hear, and what you want to communicate to them.」

％Ｂ
「...Oh!」
Rikka
「Wh-What are you yelling for...?」
％Ｂ
「M-My bad... but I've got it! I know why that lady's talk at the planetarium was so easy to listen to!」


all
Sora
「...?」
％Ｂ
「It's because she was doing everything she could to try to talk to us about stars. It was because her words were just filled with those kinds of feelings.」


％Ｂ
「I'm not saying that your explanations up until now were bad. I liked listening to them, and they were interesting. But I think what you might need to do is to really narrate.」


Sora
「...Narrate...」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. Don't just explain stuff about the stars to them. You should narrate the stars to them.」

Sora
「...*nod*」
Sora
「...I feel like I understand.」
％Ｂ
「Let's start practicing your talking starting tomorrow too. You can pretend we're the audience.」

Sora
「...I'll try my best. Thanks, Ritsu...」
Rikka
「...I-I didn't say anything that impressive.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, I know. Narusawa, could you play background music on the day of?」
Rikka
「...What?」
％Ｂ
「I think having some fitting music playing along with Sora's talk would make for a really nice feel.」

all
Rikka
「How am I supposed to carry a piano up to the rooftop?」
％Ｂ
「A piano's obviously out of the question, but I was thinking maybe a small electric keyboard or... Or maybe that was a bit rude of me to ask?」

Rikka
「Sigh... I can't believe you thought of something like that.」
Rikka
「...I'll do it if Ousaka-san becomes able to talk about the stars properly.」

％Ｂ
「Sora, you think you can do it?」

Sora
「...*nod*」
Sora
「...I'll do my best. So thanks, Ritsu.」
Rikka
「Yes. Good luck.」
