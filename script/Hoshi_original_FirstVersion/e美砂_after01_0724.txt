In-Flight Announcement
『Thank you very much for flying with us today. We will be landing at Naha Airport momentarily. Please confirm that your seat belts are securely fastened.』


In-Flight Announcement
『It's a beautiful day today in Naha. The temperature is 31 degrees Celsius. It's looking to be a hot day...』


％Ｂ
「...Over thirty. That's Okinawa for you.」
Misa
「But it isn't humid, so it isn't very hot once you get into the shade.」

Misa
「The annual average temperature in Okinawa is 23 degrees. It can go down to as low as 14 degrees in the winter. It's unimaginable to us who live in Shionagi.」


Misa
「And also, the beaches are publicly available starting in April, until mid-to-late October. And of course, one can still go diving even in winter.」


Misa
「A huge variety of fish swim through Okinawa's waters. It's certainly befitting of the name "Chura-umi," which means "beautiful ocean" in the local dialect.」


Misa
「The waters are said to be some of the clearest in the world, and are essential for the thriving coral reefs that form the foundations for the marine ecosystem―」

She's been looking out the window and talking like this the whole time.

It's heartwarming.
This'll be our first real vacation in a while.
A real-deal vacation, together with Misa!
％Ｂ
「Whoaaaahhh! This is amaziiing!」
Misa
「Yes, it is! This is the ocean! This is Okinawaaa!」
We step out from the hotel after changing into our swimsuits.
I'm crazy excited at seeing Okinawa's sea for the first time.
％Ｂ
「This is awesome! It's completely different from Shionagi's!」
Misa
「Ufufu, you're as excited as a child. But I understand how you feel.」

Misa
「I remember I was also very excited when I first saw Okinawa's ocean.」

％Ｂ
「Man, this is seriously exciting.」
all
After landing in Okinawa proper, we took a boat out to an isolated island away from the mainland.

The new species of cave crab that Misa's after was apparently discovered at a diving spot near here.

But we can't go see it right away.
We need to wait about two days here at the hotel so that they can prepare things on their end before we can go see the cave crab.

Our hotel's a villa, with Okinawa's deep blue sea stretching out before it as if it were our own private ocean.

％Ｂ
「Oh man... Is it okay for me to be here...?」
Today's the day of the Hokuou University renovations competition.
I tried to avoid being gone today, of course.
But these dates were the only ones that matched up between our schedules.

Azuma
「Hey, Hino. I told you to submit your vacation schedule, didn't I?」
Azuma
「Hey, I told you to submit your vacation schedule, didn't I?」
Azuma
「And use your paid leave already. You haven't taken a day off in months now.」

％Ｂ
「Oh... Well, uh... There are some dates I'd like off...」

Azuma
「Then just say it. When?」

％Ｂ
「About three days starting from the 24th this month...」
Azuma
「The 24th? Sure, I don't mind.」
％Ｂ
「Wha, but... Is that really okay?」
Azuma
「Is there a problem?」
％Ｂ
「That's the day of the presentation for the Hokuou University project. I may not be participating in the presentation, but I thought I should still be there...」


Azuma
「What are you worrying about that for? You don't need to be here anymore at this point.」

％Ｂ
「But...」
Azuma
「You've already done your job, and you've done it well. From here on out, it's my job.」

％Ｂ
「Is... Is that so...?」
Azuma
「Don't get the wrong idea now. I'm just saying you don't need to be here for now. You're going to be working your ass off again if we get through. So rest up before then.」


all
Shouji
「You should just take those days, if Chief's saying all that.」

％Ｂ
「Okay... Um... Then, I will...」
I ended up taking paid leave for this after my senior coworkers told me to... \nBut was this really okay?


What if the model breaks, or if there's an issue with the materials... Well I guess I don't need to be the one to fix that stuff...

Misa
「...Is something the matter?」
％Ｂ
「Oh, uh...」
Well, there's no point in thinking about it now.
Let's just get everything I can out of this Okinawa trip, so I can do good work once I get back.

％Ｂ
「Nothing. Anyway, we're finally here in Okinawa, so first...」

Misa
「Yes! Leeet's go to the beach!」
％Ｂ
「Before that!」
Misa
「Whaaat!?」
I pull Misa back as she immediately begins to rush out toward the beach.

％Ｂ
「Stop right there, Misa.」
Misa
「Why did you stop me!? The ocean is waiting for us right there～」

％Ｂ
「Remember how you told me a long time ago that it's dangerous to go into the sea without being properly prepared?」

Misa
「Y-Yes, it is!」
％Ｂ
「I've really come to appreciate those words after all these years of being together with you.」

％Ｂ
「So, Misa. Are you sure you're ready right now?」

Misa
「U-Umm... Well...」
％Ｂ
「Now, Okihara-sensei, if I recall... you told me that Okinawa has very strong ultraviolet light?」
Misa
「Yes, it does. It is said that the ultraviolet light here is several times stronger than that of the Japanese mainland. And so we must take the proper countermeasures against it.」


％Ｂ
「I see... And so what would these countermeasures be?」
Misa
「G-Good question. I purchased a sunscreen spray at the airport...」

Misa
「It's a very convenient item that instantly prevents sunburns with just one quick spray. I use it very frequently.」


％Ｂ
「...Don't underestimate Okinawa, Misa.」
Misa
「...Auh.」
％Ｂ
「Shirking on those countermeasures is a terrible idea. What are you gonna do if your pale skin gets even slightly tan?」


Misa
「Oh... Ehehe... I believe it may look rather healthy and cute in its own way...」

Misa
「Please, try imagining it.」
％Ｂ
「Hmm, well...」
all
A tanned Misa...
It wouldn't be a heavy spray-tan kinda look, but a more natural brown.

I think Misa and the sun go together well.
There'd be clear tan lines from her bikini on her body if she took in lots of sun...

Misa
「It may actually be quite nice!」
％Ｂ
「Agh!」
Misa
「Ufufufufu, you were making a slightly dirty face. Do you... perhaps wish to see my tanlines?」

％Ｂ
「N-No, I wasn't thinking anything like that. You've got really nice, soft skin, and that's what I like, Misa.」

Misa
「Is that sooo...」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, so anyway... Let's use this!」
I pull out a bottle that I bought at the same airport.
％Ｂ
「I think a spray isn't gonna be strong enough. A liquid type like this one should work great. Doesn't this stuff just scream "effective" to you?」


Misa
「...May I inspect that?」
％Ｂ
「Huh? Yeah, of course.」
Misa
「Hmm...」
％Ｂ
「What's up?」
Misa
「Well, umm... this bottle is labeled as... suntan lotion... I believe... that this may be oil to help one tan evenly.」


％Ｂ
「Whaaat!? You're kidding... I thought it was sunscreen for sure 'cause of the art on the bottle...」

The woes of a Japanese man who doesn't know English.
I remember Azuma-san said I should learn it for the sake of my future.
I should definitely get on that...
Misa
「...Ufufu. It seems... you do indeed have an interest in healthy-looking skin.」

％Ｂ
「No, I... don't really...」
Misa
「Do you really not?」
％Ｂ
「...」
％Ｂ
「I guess... I don't not have an interest...」
Misa
「Ohh, a confession.」
She pokes me in my side.
％Ｂ
「But are you fine with getting tan?」
Misa
「Yes. I've never gotten very tan before... and since we've come to Okinawa, I think experiencing something new sounds wonderful.」


Misa
「And my skin will return to the way it was before once summer ends... Okay? Perhaps we could think of it as a way to commemorate us enjoying ourselves like this together...?」


％Ｂ
「I see...」
Misa
「Oh, but of course, if you really don't want me to, then I won't...」

％Ｂ
「...No.」
I see...
Yeah, if that's the case...
％Ｂ
「All right, let's use this suntan lotion!」
Misa
「Wawah...!」
％Ｂ
「'Cause we're at the beach!」
Misa
「Yes...! Let's use it, then!」

％Ｂ
「Oh, but... Do we have to wash the spray sunscreen off you first?」
Misa
「It will be fine. They're both the same thing in terms of blocking UV light.」


Misa
「I also hear that it is better for people who do not get tan often to use two layers, to block the light further.」


％Ｂ
「I get it...」
I guess she would know, after all the fieldwork she's done over the years.
Misa
「Then... may I ask you to apply it?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, of course.」
Misa
「The ears and back of the neck are especially easy to forget when applying. I have burned there myself after forgetting to apply sunscreen there.」

％Ｂ
「I see. Yeah, we wouldn't want that. Being in pain from a sunburn would ruin our vacation. Let's be thorough.」


％Ｂ
「Stay still, all right?」
Misa
「O-Okay!」
％Ｂ
「...Here goes.」
Misa
「...Hauh...」
I start slathering the suntan lotion on her ears.
She quivers ticklishly.
％Ｂ
「You know... your ears... are crazy soft.」

Misa
「What? A-Are they...?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, your earlobes are so squishy... Oh yeah, I remember hearing before that a girl's earlobes are just as soft as their boobs.」


Misa
「Whaaat? ...Is that so? The human body is very mysterious...」

Misa
「So that would mean... this current situation is analogous to my boobs being touched...」

Misa
「This has suddenly become very embarrassing...」
％Ｂ
「No, I don't really think they're the same like that... and I think it's just an urban legend anyway...」


I smile awkwardly as I apply the suntan lotion.
It's kind of a fun sensation.
Misa
「Hauh... Please don't squish them any more than that～」
％Ｂ
「Hahaha, my bad. Then I'll put some on the backs of your ears, and on your neck... Okay.」

Looks like I was playing too much with her earlobes.
I carefully check over her skin to make sure I haven't missed any spots.
％Ｂ
「...Want me to do your boobs too?」
Misa
「Y-You can't do that. I won't be able to control myself if you do something like that now...」

Misa
「One simply cannot discount rumors, can they... Hauh...」

％Ｂ
「O-Oh really...」
It was supposed to be a joke...
I wonder what she means by the rumors thing.
Are her earlobes and her boobs really that similar...?
Misa
「Now then, I will apply it on you this time.」
％Ｂ
「S-Sure.」
Misa
「Ufufu... Please turn your ear this way.」
I hand Misa the suntan lotion.
She puts some on her fingertip and gently rubs it onto my ear.

Misa
「Oh, you're right. Your earlobe is hard. This earlobe must belong to someone who does not have very soft boobs...」

％Ｂ
「Hahaha, got that right.」
Misa
「Hmm... Then shall I check my answer? Like this!」

％Ｂ
「Whoa!」
She squeezes my chest tight from behind.
Misa
「Ahahahaha, yes, you are indeed flat.」
％Ｂ
「Why you little...」
I wanna get her back...
But we can't do anything too crazy here on a beach.
But I can still...
％Ｂ
「All right, then I'm gonna put more on your ears!」
Misa
「Hyauuuhh!」
Misa
「Not my eeears... A-Aahn... Please don't rub them...! No pulling either...! Hyan...!」


We play around as we apply the suntan lotion on each other.
all
％Ｂ
「Phew... There we go. I think we're both thoroughly covered. Now that we're fully prepared, ready to go to the beach?」


Misa
「Y-Yeeeesss...」
％Ｂ
「Honestly. Come on, get it together.」
Misa
「I-I apologize...」
％Ｂ
「Your face is a bit red.」
Misa
「I-I may... have already gotten slightly burnt...」
all
Misa's all woozy for some reason. I grab her by the hand and lead her to the beach.
We walk along the shoreline, feeling the fine sand beneath our feet.
Misa
「Kyah! ...Wow, the waves come up very far.」
The waves chase after our feet.
Misa's voice bounces happily.
％Ｂ
「There's a nice, cool sea breeze.」
Misa
「The sun's rays are stronger here in Okinawa, but the average summer temperature is actually lower here than in Tokyo.」

Misa
「And the strongest winds in the country blow here. This wind is the reason why summer is so pleasant.」

％Ｂ
「This is a good time of year, without any hurricanes or anything.」
Misa
「Yes! And Okinawa's unique climate is home to unique organisms...」

Misa
「Ahhh! It seems we have already found one!」
％Ｂ
「Wh-What is it?」
Misa
「Here, please come see! A Coenobita hermit crab!」
％Ｂ
「W-Wow... That thing's huge!」
all
Misa's pointing at the beach.
There's a hermit crab that's maybe the size of my hand crawling on the sand leisurely.

％Ｂ
「Man, it's so tropical here...」
Misa
「It appears this hermit crab is inhabiting a spiral shell. By the way, these are designated as a protected species, so we are not allowed to catch it.」

％Ｂ
「Is it really? Doesn't really seem like it's that rare if we found it this easily.」


Misa
「Oh yes, that's true... Their population has decreased in many regions, but it seems it isn't the case here in Okinawa.」


Misa
「There may even be people who eat them...」
％Ｂ
「Uh... You can eat these?」
I guess it looks like it could have a decent amount of meat...
Misa
「Ufufu... But... we will just be watching!」
Misa
「Wow～ It's very cute, isn't it～」
She sits back and watches the hermit crab amble along.
This is pretty nice.
all
With the tropical wind and the summer sun, this is looking like it's gonna be a perfect vacation.
e美砂_9008エッチシーン8
We're at the beach for a nighttime after-dinner stroll.
We're sitting down on the sand under the moonlight, looking out over the black sea.
We've stripped down to our swimwear.
Feeling the water lap at the soles of our feet.
The sound of the waves forms a soothing background track.
The comfortable wind blows gently on our tanned skin.
％Ｂ
「...This is great... It's like time's stopped here.」
It's gotten me to stop thinking about everything, including work.
Misa
「Yes... You're right.」
And it looks like Misa feels the same way.
％Ｂ
「I'm glad we came here. I might not have gotten to feel this way if you hadn't picked Okinawa for our vacation.」


Misa
「I agree. I just hope we can see the cave crab now...」

％Ｂ
「I guess we'll find out tomorrow.」
I smile stiffly.
I'm already satisfied with this mood, but Misa's already thinking about the cave crabs tomorrow.

％Ｂ
「...Um, hey... I've got something I wanna tell you, Misa.」
The words come out of my mouth without really thinking.

I've been with Misa all this time, and I've been so happy...
And I want to be with her from now on, too...
That's right... I want... to marry Misa.
Misa
「I have something to tell you too.」
％Ｂ
「Wha... D-Do you?」
Misa
「Yes. Um...」
Misa checks the time on her phone.
Misa
「Arita-san told me to keep it a secret until the day of... but it's okay now, since it's past midnight.」


％Ｂ
「Is this about what you two were talking about before?」
Misa
「Yes, it is. There will be a proposal for the municipal legislative assembly to reopen Marinpia Shionagi today.」


％Ｂ
「Huh? ...A proposal to reopen Marinpia? You mean...?」
Misa
「If the proposal is approved... Marinpia Shionagi will be able to reopen.」

％Ｂ
「R-Really!?」
Misa
「Yes! Really!」
Marinpia Shionagi reopening...
It's Misa's dream, and by extension my dream too.
％Ｂ
「So our dream... is finally gonna come true.」
Misa
「Though we still don't know if it will be approved...」
％Ｂ
「Still, it's a huge surprise that things moved along this much at all.」
Misa
「It appears that many of the assembly members approve of our hard work, such as with the "marine wildlife classroom." I was told that now would be the best timing for a proposal.」


％Ｂ
「I remember Arita-san said something like that to me too. I see... so the assembly's finally getting involved. Wow... Your passion's moved the hearts of so many people...」


Misa
「Though of course, the budget and parent organization must be considered... There are still many issues, and so it may not go smoothly...」


％Ｂ
「Don't worry. I'm sure the proposal'll go through! I guarantee it! Uh, I guess that doesn't really mean much, but...」

Misa
「Oh no, there's nothing more reassuring than hearing you say that. It has always been that way for me.」


％Ｂ
「As in...?」
Misa
「You have supported me so many times until now. Whenever I was about to break, you were always there to believe in me and encourage me.」


Misa
「That has always supported me. Your words and your actions have supported me regarding Marinpia as well.」


Misa
「I believe that is why we were able to arrive at this day.」

％Ｂ
「No... That's all because of your hard work.」
Misa
「No, I was able to do that hard work only because you were there.」
％Ｂ
「...Really... I'm glad you think that.」
Misa
「...If Marinpia's reopening will be approved, then... I would like to take on even more work to communicate the wonders of the ocean, and of nature.」


％Ｂ
「You mean... You're gonna work at Marinpia, right?」
Misa
「Yes... I intend on doing so. Because Marinpia is my dream.」

It's incredible how she can give that answer without any hesitation.
She'd definitely become a professor one day if she stayed at the university.
But her future is with Marinpia.\n\r
She doesn't have even a single shred of doubt in that regard.
Misa
「...As inept as I am... May I ask you to support me from now on, as well?」
She asks with serious eyes.
％Ｂ
「Of course. I'll always be there to support you. That hasn't changed since the day I made that promise at the Tanabata Festival.」


Misa
「I was depressed this whole time, until you came to our school, Ryousuke-san.」

Misa
「I was depressed this whole time, until you came to our school.」

Misa
「I had been acting optimistic as usual... but I could not remove the pain of Marinpia's closure from within my heart.」


Misa
「It felt like the things that I like, that I love, had been rejected. It felt to me as if my own future itself had been rejected.」

Misa
「But I came to learn many important things in the time that I have spent together with you, Ryousuke-san.」

Misa
「But I came to learn many important things in the time that I have spent together with you.」

Misa
「To believe in myself. To believe in my friends. And... to believe in possibilities.」

Misa
「I would like to study much more and communicate the wonders of the ocean, and of nature, to many people... I wish to share this wonderful thought with everyone.」


Misa
「I will no longer hesitate in pursuing that dream.」
％Ｂ
「Misa-senpai...」
I step next to her and gently take her hand.
％Ｂ
「Then I'll support you. I'll watch over you.」

％Ｂ
「I'll always be by your side, and always be there when you can't take it anymore, and need someone to lean on.」

Misa
「I'm so happy... And I will also become someone who can support your dreams, Ryousuke-san.」


Misa
「I'm so happy... And I will also become someone who can support your dreams.」


Misa
「So from now on...」
％Ｂ
「Yes. We'll always be together.」
Misa
「Yes!」
％Ｂ
「I knew back then... that you would charge forward toward your dreams without hesitating... and I wanted to be there by your side the whole time. And that still hasn't changed.」


％Ｂ
「So I'm going to keep on supporting you, Misa.」
Misa
「Thank you very much... I'm so happy...」
Her smile's the same as it was back then.
Misa
「Oh, by the way... Ryousuke-san, you said you had something to say to me too, didn't you?」

Misa
「Oh, by the way... You said you had something to say to me too, didn't you?」

％Ｂ
「Uh... Y-Yeah... That was, uh... It wasn't anything important.」
If Marinpia reopens, Misa's life would become busy.
She probably wouldn't have the time to think about marriage.
％Ｂ
「I was gonna say we did a lot today, so we should turn in early tonight and rest up for tomorrow. Yeah.」

Misa
「You're right. Tomorrow is finally the day we meet the cave crab. Shall we rest for today, then?」

％Ｂ
「Yeah. Let's do that.」
I'm still only half qualified compared to the way Misa chases after her dreams.
I'm gonna wait until I'm at least on even footing with her before I can talk about marrying her...
