I've been to Narusawa's place a few times already, and it still makes me a little nervous to be there, but it's not as bad when I'm practicing.

It's a little after noon now, and Narusawa's making food.
％Ｂ
「Narusawa, let me help with something.」
Watching her cook from behind isn't bad, but it doesn't feel right to do nothing.

Rikka
「Really? Then could you get the circular plates out from the top of that shelf? I need to use a chair to get those.」

％Ｂ
「Suuure thing.」
all
She gestured to a cupboard just above the sink with her eyes.
Narusawa's tall for a girl, but she's still about ten centimeters shorter than me.
％Ｂ
「Hup... These plates?」
Rikka
「Yes, thank you. You're very nice to have around.」
％Ｂ
「Haha. This is pretty much the only thing I'm useful for, though.」
Rikka
「That's not true. The rice porridge you made was delicious.」
％Ｂ
「I bet it'd taste even better if you made it, though.」
Rikka
「Do you want me to make you rice porridge?」
She seems to have interpreted that differently from what I intended.
But now that she's already asked, I know what my answer is.
％Ｂ
「I think I do, yeah.」
She thinks a little.
Rikka
「That might be a little difficult right now, because I've already started the omurice.」

Rikka
「So I'll make that another time... I know, I'll make it for you the next time you have to stay home sick.」

Uoooooooohhhhhh!
I wanna go get sick right awaaaaaaaay!!
％Ｂ
「Looking forward to it.」
Rikka
「Hehe. Not getting sick would be for the best.」
She laughs and throws some chopped vegetables in the pan.
The sizzling and the smell of grilled vegetables stimulate my empty stomach.

Rikka
「Lala～ lalala～ lala～ lalala～」
Her happy humming forms a sort of harmony with the sound of her cooking.
Narusawa's begun to show me this side of her now that we've gotten closer.
I just like her smile.
I want to see her smile in lots more ways... No. I really want to be the one to make her smile.

％Ｂ
「Wanna go out and have some fun after we're done with practice today?」
Rikka
「Have fun where?」
％Ｂ
「I'm gonna go play futsal at the park. It's all people you know, like Shuuichi and Segawa.」

Rikka
「...Okay. I'll participate.」
％Ｂ
「All right, let's do it!」
I'm looking forward to the afternoon even more now.
all
Touko
「Shooooooooot!!」
all
％Ｂ
「Oh, crap!?」
I'm just barely out of reach to block Yukimura's powerful shot, and she scores a goal.

We're all yelling and having fun at the seaside park.
Marika
「I'm sorry. She stole the ball away from me...」
％Ｂ
「It's no big deal. Let's use that as info for the next round.」
all
But we're at an overwhelming disadvantage.
The only guys here are Shuuichi and me, so we split up first to be the goalkeepers.

The girls picked teams based on a lottery...
And Shuuichi's team ended up having the all-rounder athlete Yukimura, the decent Segawa, and the completely unknown variable Ousaka.

all
My team consists of Narusawa, Shinozaki, and Okihara-senpai. None of them play sports much.
The one silver lining is that Okihara-senpai is a lot more athletic than I expected.

％Ｂ
「Let's get a point off of them to even things out!」
Rikka
「Yes.」
Marika
「Okay!」
Misa
「Let's do our best!」
We're perfect in terms of teamwork and motivation.
Shinozaki's the most excited out of all of us.
Maybe this is something like a bit of a dream come true for her, since she could never do things like this as a kid.

Thinking about it that way makes me strangely happy.
all
The girls all cluster together and talk happily in the shade.
Narusawa's wiping her sweat away with a towel, running her fingers through her hair to pull it away from her cheeks.

I'm watching her from a bit further away.
Natsuki
「...Hm? Hah, haaah～ ...Ku, ku, ku!」
Segawa spots me looking, laughs impishly, and taps Narusawa on the shoulder.
She points toward me.
Rikka
「Oh...」
％Ｂ
「Oh...」
all
My heart thumps clangorously when our eyes meet.
Uh, this is crazy embarrassing.
But it'd be rude to look away like this, right?
Rikka
「...」
％Ｂ
「...」
Narusawa must have thought the same thing. We're still looking at each other.
Which means that the two of us are just looking into each other's eyes for a while.
all
Thump, thump...
My heart refuses to calm down. If anything, it's just ringing louder in my ears.
Rikka
（
Hino-kun 
％Ａ-kun 
and I are staring at each other...）
He's looking right at me.
It's like he can see into the depths of my soul.
It's really embarrassing... but I'm incredibly happy.
Rikka
（One... two... three... four... five... six... seven... eight...）
I slowly count the seconds.
I want to avert my eyes out of embarrassment so badly, but I also want to look at his face for as long as I can.

It's a game of patience to see how long we can look at each other.
It's so exciting my breath catches.
I want this to continue on for as long as it possibly can.
Rikka
（24... 25... 26... 27... 28...）
Almost thirty seconds.
I don't know how long it's actually been.
I think I'm counting slowly, but my heart's just beating too fast.
It might be influencing me, making me count faster.
Natsuki
「Today's crazy hot around here, isn't it...」
Natsuki
「Hey, Rikka... Rikka... Rikka, can you hear me? Heeey, Rikkaaa～」


I finally realize that Segawa-san's been calling my name.
Rikka
「Oh... What is it?」
Natsuki
「Why don't you wave?」
Rikka
「Wha... Wave... You mean to 
Hino-kun
him
?」
Natsuki
「Who else even is there? Nirasawa?」
Rikka
「I don't want to do that.」
Natsuki
「Oh my, how honest. So it has to be him, then?」
She's looking at me like she already knows everything... And she actually must know everything.
I just can't hide anything from Segawa-san.
Rikka
「But... it would be embarrassing.」
Natsuki
「It'll only be embarrassing at first... Probably. He'd jump for joy if you waved at him～」

Rikka
「I don't think he'd jump for joy... but would he be happy?」
Natsuki
「No mistake.」
Rikka
「...」
Segawa's whispering something into Narusawa's ear.
Narusawa keeps glancing back and forth between me and Segawa...

all
But then she hesitantly raises her hand.
Rikka
「
Hino-ku...n... Hino...kun...
Hey... Hey...
」
Her voice is vanishingly soft, but she's definitely calling 
out my name
for me
.
Our eyes meet.
Rikka
「Ah...uh...」
And then she slowly moves her upraised hand left and right.
％Ｂ
「...!」
Narusawa's waving at me!?
Oh crap, I think my blood vessels are gonna explode...
But I can't just stand here.
％Ｂ
「N-Narusawa...」
I numbly raise my right hand...
And return the wave.
Rikka
「...Gh, uuuuh～ ...Uuuhhh～～」

Natsuki
「Ahahaha! Okay now, there, there! You did a great job! Good girl!」

Narusawa turns bright red and looks away. Segawa pats her on the head.

Narusawa's so cute...
I'm glad I mustered up the courage to wave back.
all
Shuuichi
「Looks like things are going well. Oh, and no stupid questions at this point like asking how I know.」
％Ｂ
「I'm not gonna ask. Since how long?」
Shuuichi
「I only became sure of it recently, but I've been thinking it might be like that for a while now.」

％Ｂ
「I don't actually remember when it started. I just realized at some point that I liked her. My heart hurts every day, but I've really been having fun too.」


Shuuichi
「Maybe it would've been better for the two of you to have been alone together today, then?」

％Ｂ
「This is fine too. I want Narusawa to smile and be friends with all of us.」

Shuuichi
「You really put your girlfriend first, eh? Hm? Hmm～ I guess it's more like you put your crush first? Hahaha. Anyway, aren't you gonna confess?」


％Ｂ
「I'm thinking about it, but...」
Shuuichi
「What are you thinking so hard for?」
％Ｂ
「I'm just worried that she might say no.」
Shuuichi
「You're a real pessimist sometimes, you know that? Though I guess it means you're just that serious about this.」

Shuuichi
「I get how you feel. The closer you are, the more you think about what'll happen if she says no. Like, how are you supposed to talk to her from now on?」


Shuuichi
「I know I never ended up confessing to Kaori-san, and I regretted that.」
％Ｂ
「...」
Shuuichi
「But... hindsight's twenty-twenty, and I should've just stopped caring about dumb stuff like that and just said it.」

Shuuichi
「Kaori-san, I love yooooooooouuu!!」
Shuuichi's roar echoes through the park.
Shuuichi
「Like that.」
％Ｂ
「Wha, we're in public, you idiot! Everyone's looking at us!」
Families and couples around us stop and look in our direction.

Segawa and Yukimura are cracking up. Shinozaki and Okihara-senpai look confused. Narusawa and Ousaka just sigh.

Shuuichi
「Hahahahaha! Anyway, why not ask her out on a date?」

％Ｂ
「I've already been out to do stuff with her a few times.」
Shuuichi
「You idiot. Asking her beforehand's meaningful. You ever done that?」

％Ｂ
「Oh... I haven't.」
Shuuichi
「If you like her, then put some effort into it.」
He pats me on the back lightly.
It's like that pat's lit a spark of courage inside me.
Shuuichi
「If you don't want it to end with just being friends, that is.」
all
Those words mean a lot coming from him.
I'm having Narusawa teach me music, so I'm confident that I'm the closest to her out of all of the guys at school.

But what happens when I'm finished with that practical exam?
Are we gonna go back to just talking occasionally in the classroom or in the music room like before?

I don't want that.
I know that for sure.
Misa
「Now then, I will be taking my leave.」

Sora
「...See you.」
Touko
「I'm starviiing...」
all
We all start on our respective ways home at around sundown, tired and satisfied from playing futsal.
I make a big decision as I watch everyone go.
I've been thinking about it since Shuuichi and I talked about it earlier today.
...I'm gonna ask Narusawa out on a date.
This is something that should be done as soon as the idea comes to mind, while I still have momentum.

％Ｂ
「Let's go home together, Narusawa. I wanna talk to you about something.」
Rikka
「You want to talk? Why so proper all of a sudden?」
％Ｂ
「Uhh～ ...How about we talk while we walk?」
Our friends might have gone home, but there are still a few people left in the park.

I'd need to be a little braver to ask her out on a date here.
I'd like it to be when it's just the two of us alone, if possible.
But Narusawa frowns a bit.
Rikka
「...I was thinking of going to the marketplace on my way home today. My fridge is mostly empty after the cooking I did today.」

％Ｂ
「Then I'll hold your bags, since I ate that food too.」
Rikka
「Hehe, then could I ask you to? Let's go together, then.」
The marketplace is bustling with people picking up groceries for dinner.

Looks like we've come here during a limited-time sale, from the looks of the flyers taped up to the store entrance.

This really isn't the place to ask her out on a date.
As for what Narusawa's doing right now, she's staring intently at the flyers.
Seeing her like that's heartwarming enough to put a smile on my face.

Rikka
「Is there anything you want to eat?」
％Ｂ
「Wha?」
My heart jumps at those words.
It's like we're a married couple, or living together...
Rikka
「For lunch tomorrow. I want to know if you have any requests.」
％Ｂ
「Ohh...」
Seems she's planning on making lunch for me again tomorrow for our music lesson.
％Ｂ
「I'm fine with anything you make.」
Rikka
「Anything... That's the hardest possible request.」
％Ｂ
「Hmm～ Then―」
all
I place the bags I'm holding down in front of the fridge after walking back to Narusawa's place with her.

With this, my job here is done...
No, there's still one more thing.
I need to ask her out on a date.
％Ｂ
「N-Narusawa...!」
I call out to her as she begins to place the groceries into the fridge.
She turns around, a warm smile on her face.
Rikka
「Could you wait a minute? I'll make some tea once I'm done putting these away.」

％Ｂ
「Okay, thanks... I mean!」
Rikka
「...?」
％Ｂ
「I have something I wanna talk about...」
Rikka
「Yes, I remember. That's why I thought we could relax and talk about it with some tea...」

Uhh, I gotta ask her if she's got any plans tomorrow, and if not, then ask her out on a date...
Wait a second, do I need to tell her where we're going first?
Or do I ask her if she wants to go somewhere?
I thought it over thoroughly earlier, but now that the moment's here, my mind's gone blank from nervousness.
I wanna ask her out on a date so bad, but the words are being crushed away, disappearing from my brain.

％Ｂ
「Um... I-I've got something important to say, so can I message you on LIME tonight?」
This is the best I can do.
Rikka
「Huh? Okay...」
％Ｂ
「I'll do that, then. I'm fine for tea today. Talk to you tonight!」
all
Rikka
「Wha... I thought you wanted to... What!?」
It's a strategic retreat... No, it's far from that.
I say goodbye to the confused Narusawa and leave.
I've been staring at the message I've typed up for nearly an hour.
I deleted some stuff when it got too long-winded, added to it when it got too short to be understandable, and reworded things when I got too formal.
"Wanna go hang out together tomorrow after we're done practicing?"
This is the sentence that I've settled on. I think this should be enough to get my point across.
I've deliberately avoided saying the word "date." I think it's a bit much when we're not even in a relationship.

All that's left is to press the send button. That's all, but...
％Ｂ
「It's easy for him, he's already got a girlfriend...」
My heart furiously beat a drum in my chest for every letter I typed.

Once I send it, there's no taking it back.
But nothing will happen if I don't send it.
％Ｂ
「Please be an "okay"!」
I make a wish and press the send button.
％Ｂ
「I-I sent it... How long's it usually take for her to respond? ...She's gonna respond, right?」

...
Five minutes later.
％Ｂ
「No response. No, she probably just hasn't seen it yet.」
...
Fifteen minutes later.
％Ｂ
「...No response. No, I bet she's just taking a bit of time to type up her response. Yeah, that's it.」

...
Thirty minutes later.
％Ｂ
「...Still no response.」
I don't have enough romantic experience to be able to come up with any more things to tell myself.

Life is hell.
Rikka
「...」
I've been staring at Hino-kun's message for a while now without being able to think.
I've been staring at ％Ａ-kun's message for a while now without being able to think.
Rikka
「This is what he wanted to talk about... Is he asking me out on a date? But it doesn't actually say it's a date, so if I'm just misunderstanding...」


My face and my mind are all steamed up with heat. I can't think.
This is the first time I've been asked by a boy to do something alone together...
It would be horribly embarrassing if it wasn't actually a date, and it was just me overthinking things.
I don't think I can make a decision in my current state.
Rikka
「...Maybe I should ask Segawa-san for advice. She has a big social circle, so I'm sure she's been asked out on a date or something before.」


all
【Rikka】「Can I ask you for some #Nadvice...?」
【Natsuki】「What is it? It's not #Nevery day you ask me #Nfor something!」
【Rikka】「I'm not being a bother, #Nam I?」
【Natsuki】「Not at all! Lay it on #Nme!」
【Rikka】「I've been asked if I #Nwant to go somewhere #Nwith someone. Do you #Nthink it's supposed to #Nbe a date?」
【Natsuki】「By ％Ａ?」
.........
......
...
【Natsuki】「Heeey. Rikkaaa! Anyone #Nhooome?」
【Rikka】「Let's say it's #N％Ａ-kun as an #Nexample, then...」
【Natsuki】「It's ％Ａ, right?」
【Rikka】「I'm sorry. Never mind #Nabout the advice.」
【Natsuki】「Now wait just one #Nsecond! #NFine, it's ％Ａ #N(hypothetically)! I'd #Nlove to give you advice!」
【Natsuki】「I'm really happy that #Nyou're coming to me for #Nadvice!」
【Natsuki】「But it's not like I've #Never been asked out on #Na date either, so I #Ndunno.」
【Natsuki】「I know. Let's get the #Nother girls in here too.」
【Marika】「Hellooo.」
【Touko】「What's wrong?」
【Rikka】「There's something I #Nwant advice on.」
【Misa】「If we may be of any #Nhelp, then we would #nlove to listen!」
【Sora】_st_0310
【Rikka】「I want to hear your #Nopinions on a message I #Ngot from a certain boy.」
【Marika】「Is that ％Ａ-kun?」
【Misa】「This is Rikka-san, so #Nit must be ％Ｂ-san.」
【Sora】「Only one person it #Ncould be.」
【Touko】「Can't really think of #Nanyone else, yeah.」
【Natsuki】「No, guys. #NIt's ％Ａ #N(hypothetically).」
【Misa】「What does that mean?」
【Rikka】「Whatever, fine, it's #N％Ａ-kun...」
【Rikka】「％Ａ-kun asked me #Nif I wanted to go #Nsomewhere with him #Ntomorrow. What do you #Nthink that means?」
【Marika】「Isn't that a date?」
【Misa】「I am sure that is the #Ncase.」
【Sora】「Red bean rice to #Ncelebrate...」
【Touko】「Sounds tasty. I'm #Nhungry.」
There isn't any clear answer in the end, since no one here has any experience with dates.
【Natsuki】「Isn't it just about #Nwhat you wanna do, #NRikka? Dates or #Nwhatever aside.」
【Misa】「As to whether you would #Nlike to be with him, yes.」
【Marika】「Like whether you want #Nto hold hands?」
【Natsuki】「Like whether you #Nwanna kiss!」
【Marika】「Kiss!? Do people #Nkiss on their first #Ndates!?」
【Sora】「So bold...」
【Touko】「I think it might not #Nend with just a kiss if #Nyou get going.」
【Rikka】「No!! Geez...」
【Rikka】「But thank you. I'll be #Nright back.」
【Marika】「Okay. Good luck.」
【Marika】_st_0105
【Sora】_st_0301
【Natsuki】「Go get him!」
【Natsuki】_st_0204
【Misa】「Please do your best!」
【Touko】「Go for iiit.」
％Ｂ
「...」
％Ｂ
「......」
％Ｂ
「Guaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhh!!」
％Ｂ
「There's no freaking response! Does she think I'm a creep 'cause I suddenly asked her out on a date!? Was she like, "As if, you disgusting creep"!?」

I writhe on the ground, head in my hands.
I must apologize to all the people of the earth.
I am so sorry for overstepping my bounds as a commoner, and aiming so high with my love!
【Rikka】「Okay, sure.」
％Ｂ
「......」
％Ｂ
「...」
％Ｂ
「All riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiighttt!!」
I roll around on the ground again.
Rikka
「Haaaaaaahhh～～～」
I let out a long sigh.
I'm tense all over.
Once I relax, I start feeling like I'm in a dream.
all
【Natsuki】「How'd it gooo?」
【Rikka】「I told him I'd come.」
【Sora】「It's a date...」
【Marika】「You're right, it's a #Ndate! Wow, ％Ａ-kun #Nand Narusawa-san, on a #Ndate! Congratulations!」
【Marika】_st_0108
【Misa】「Congratulations to you! #NI believe the two of #Nyou are a very good #Nmatch!」
【Touko】「Think you might want to #Nsave saying something #Nlike that for later...」
【Misa】「I apologize. I was so #Nhappy for you that I #Ngot ahead of myself.」
【Natsuki】「And so would you like #Nto have a cameraman #Nwith you to commemorate #Nyour first date?」
【Marika】「You can't go with!」
【Natsuki】「But aren't you curious? #NIt's a date between #Nyour childhood friend #Nand another one of your #Nfriends.」
【Misa】_st_0219
【Marika】「Well... I am...」
【Sora】_st_0304
【Marika】「I mean no, we can't!」
Everyone's a lot more excited about this than I thought.
And I'm in high spirits too.
Our night continued on like that for a while afterward.
