The next day.
I've come to the second chemistry classroom for a meeting after school.
％Ｂ
「Excuse meee.」
Marika
「Oh, hi～」
％Ｂ
「Huh? Is it just you here, Shinozaki? Where's Okihara-senpai?」
Marika
「She sent us a LIME message saying she'd be late because something came up.」
％Ｂ
「My bad, I didn't see that. So you were waiting?」
Marika
「I am still doing work. I'm feeding them right now.」

％Ｂ
「You know where the fish food is and everything?」
Marika
「I do～ Because I've been put in charge of feeding. Take a look.」

I pull out my phone and look at LIME.
【Marika】「We'll be coming by the #Nsecond chemistry #Nclassroom to plan for #Nthe Tanabata Festival #Nagain today.」
【Misa】「I'm sorry, but I've #Nbeen asked to take care #Nof something, so I'll #Nbe slightly late.」
【Marika】「That's okay. I'll just #Nwatch the fish while I #Nwait.」
【Misa】「If you'd like, you can #Nfeed them. There is a #Nblue bottle next to the #Nrightmost tank. That #Nwould be their food.」
【Marika】「Roger that～」
【Marika】_st_0109
【Misa】「Please be careful not #Nto give them too much. #NThank you very much.」
【Misa】_st_0220
I didn't even see this conversation...
Marika
「See?」
％Ｂ
「What do you mean, "See?" It's not like you were actually put in charge of it.」
Marika
「I think it's pretty much the same thing～」
She sprinkles the food into the fish tanks.
The fish immediately swim up to the surface to eat it as it sinks.
...That looks kinda fun.
％Ｂ
「Hey, let me try that too.」
Marika
「Mmm～ I dunnooo～」
％Ｂ
「Wha... Just a bit's fine, isn't it?」
Marika
「Whaaat～ But I'm the one who's in charge of feeding them, so～」
％Ｂ
「Hm... Is someone calling?」
Marika
「Oh... It's mine. Yes, hello... This is Shinozaki.」

all
Shinozaki puts down the bottle of fish food and answers the phone.
Okay, now's my chance...
I quietly steal the bottle and try sprinkling just a little bit into the tank.

％Ｂ
「Ohh... They're eating!」
The little fish are chomping at the food.
This is pretty fun.
Marika
「Yes... A change in my shift? No, that's fine.」
Looks like her call's still going. I'm gonna feed the rest of the fish while I can.

％Ｂ
「Oh, there's the yellowtail wrasse.」
I spot the reddish yellowtail wrasse we caught yesterday. It's swimming around energetically in one of the tanks.

％Ｂ
「All right, here's some food.」
It immediately starts eating when I sprinkle the food in.
％Ｂ
「I still can't believe you ended up being in that trap.」
I was thinking I'd get the blue adult, but we ended up with this red guy. I didn't realize at all that he was a yellowtail wrasse.


％Ｂ
「But it all worked out in the end. We're gonna raise you carefully. Eat lots of food and grow big fast, all right?」


Marika
「Yes... I understand. Excuse me, then.」
％Ｂ
「That from your work?」
Marika
「Yeah... Were you listening?」
％Ｂ
「Just a bit. Something about a shift or something.」
Marika
「Yeah, it was about a change in my shifts... and I guess the rest was just them venting.」
％Ｂ
「Venting?」
Marika
「There's this one boy in the children's class that's too afraid of the water to put his face underwater.」

％Ｂ
「Huh, and he's still in a swimming class?」
Marika
「His parents want him to, but I think he wants to be able to swim too. But he just can't help but get scared when he's in the water.」


Marika
「There are lots of kids like that. Some of them can put their face underwater, but they can't dive down deeper.」

％Ｂ
「So how do you teach kids like that how to swim?」
Marika
「Patiently... I guess～ We chip away at their fear bit by bit and gradually get it so they can dive into the water.」

％Ｂ
「That sounds like it takes time.」
Marika
「It does～ ...But taking time doesn't mean that you're guaranteed to be okay with water by the end. There are kids who quit the class without being able to do it too.」


Marika
「"They don't have to learn how to swim, but it'd be nice if we could at least get them to not be afraid of the water～" is what she was saying... Sounds like she's having problems.」


Marika
「It'd be nice if we could do something for them～」
％Ｂ
「Hm...」
all
Misa
「Thank you for waiting. I apologize for being late―」
％Ｂ
「Maybe a reward or something could work? You could give them candy or something if they're able to submerge.」

Marika
「I think candy might not work～ Food isn't allowed at the pool, and there are kids with parents who limit their snacks too.」


％Ｂ
「Hmm, I thought it was a good idea, too.」
Misa
「Um, is something the matter?」
％Ｂ
「Oh, Okihara-senpai.」
Marika
「Okihara-san.」
％Ｂ
「I know. Could we ask you for some advice?」
Misa
「Yes, if you're fine with me.」
all
Misa
「I see, I see. So you're looking for a good way to remove a child's fear of water... Is that correct?」


％Ｂ
「I think it's fine if they could just get used to it. We just need to teach them that they don't need to be afraid of water. And you could do that by hanging some candy in front of their eyes...」


Marika
「But I don't think that'll work if their fear wins out. You need to take the time to show them they can be friends with the water～」

Misa
「I understand the issue. I have a good solution for this!」

all
She pulls out a notebook and pen from her bag, and starts drawing something onto a blank page.

％Ｂ
「...」
Shinozaki and I wait for her to finish drawing.
Misa
「How about something like this?」
Her drawing's incredibly realistic-looking.
It's of a group of children happily swimming alongside lots of fish inside a giant water tank.

Misa
「Their fear of water would disappear in no time at all this way! In fact, I believe this would motivate the children to want to learn how to swim more.」


％Ｂ
「Uhh...」
Misa
「Would this not work?」
％Ｂ
「You're right that it looks fun, but...」
Marika
「It's not really... realistic... The pool has chlorine too, so...」

Misa
「I see... That's a shame.」
Oh. She's depressed.
...She really thought that was a good idea just now.
％Ｂ
「N-No, I think it's good as an idea.」
Marika
「I'm sure that they'd be like, "They're so pretty～" if there were lots of cute fish with them.」

Misa
「...Then how about something like this?」
all
She then starts drawing on a new page.
Misa
「This!」
％Ｂ
「...Huh?」
Marika
「Oh...」
Misa
「I think this method would be more realistic...」
％Ｂ
「You're right, this could...」
Marika
「Yeah... This might work.」
％Ｂ
「Hey, why don't you actually suggest this idea to the people at the pool?」

Marika
「Yeah～ Maybe I'll try telling them about it, since it looked like they were really having issues.」
Shinozaki pulls out her phone.
She takes a picture of Okihara-senpai's drawing and sends it via mail.
...It'd be pretty interesting if they actually ended up using this idea.
