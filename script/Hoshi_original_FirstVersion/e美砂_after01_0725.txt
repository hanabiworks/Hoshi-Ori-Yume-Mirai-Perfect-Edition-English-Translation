The next day, we get on a boat and head toward the diving spot where the cave crab was spotted.

Misa used her university connections to get the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology's marine science research program to help with arranging the boat and stuff.

I guess I'm pretty much Misa's photography assistant for this.
％Ｂ
「I'm a bit worried. I haven't gone diving in a while.」
Misa
「But you did get a license, didn't you?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, I did.」
It was back in high school.
I got really into diving after Misa took me to Urashima Island, and got a diving license when I was a third year.

There was also another motive in that if I had one, I could help Misa if she needed anything.

But I got busy during university, and even busier once I joined Azuma-san's firm. I haven't gone diving even once since.

％Ｂ
「I've got the qualifications, but none of the experience.」
Misa
「It will be okay. You were a natural the first time you dived with me. I'll also be there to support you.」


％Ｂ
「I'm really counting on you. Seriously...」
Researcher
「We're here. The cave crabs have been confirmed to live in the underwater cave below us.」

Misa
「Then let us dive!」
％Ｂ
「Yeah!」
It's my first time diving in a long time.
I'm excited, but also worried.
Now then, let's see how it goes...
I'm utterly flabbergasted at the ocean before my eyes.
I see schools of vividly colored fish swimming gracefully through the just barely blue-tinted waters.

There are coral reefs that are just as vividly colored expanding below me on the ocean floor. It's like a field of flowers.

I remember how amazing the ocean was the first time I went diving at Urashima Island.
But I'm far more moved now than I was back then.
％Ｂ
「...」
And Princess Otohime herself swims before me.
It's been a long time since I've watched Misa dive too, but she's still just as pretty as ever...

...Hm?
She's signaling something to me.
『Look... down...?』
I follow her instructions, and...
I see a colony of crabs there below me.
Are these the cave crabs we're looking for?
I can see Misa's incredibly excited face through her mask.

She must be so happy, and so excited...
And of course, once we get back up on the boat, Misa's positively bouncing with excitement.
Misa
「Did you see!? We happened across such wonderful crabs!」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, that was awesome!」
Misa
「Ahhh, I wish I could stay here in Okinawa and participate in the research here!」

％Ｂ
「Hahaha...」
The other researchers smile sympathetically at Misa's excitement.
Researcher
「We can share some of the sample specimens our university has collected with you, if you'd like.」

Misa
「What!? Really!?」
Researcher
「Yes. We would love to contribute to your research, Dr. Okihara.」
Misa
「Thank you very much! I will treasure them in my research!」

％Ｂ
「Ohh! That's great, Misa!」
Misa
「Yes! This is just too wonderful! It's so wonderful!」

And Misa was excited all the way through the flight home too...
