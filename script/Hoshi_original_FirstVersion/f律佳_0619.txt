Rikka
「...No good at all. You fail. Your mi, fa, ti, do are all still sharp compared to the piano's.」

％Ｂ
「Still no good!」
Rikka
「This is going to get into the weeds a little, but the notes aren't all the same distance away from each other. Look at the keys here. Do you see how there isn't a black key between mi and fa, and ti and do?」


％Ｂ
「Oh. You're right. I always thought the white and black keys just alternated.」

Rikka
「If there's a black key in between, then it's a whole step... as in, two half steps. If there isn't a black key, then it's just a half step.」

％Ｂ
「So they go up in pitch by different amounts.」
Rikka
「Yes. That's why solfège sounds the way it does. 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1... It might be better for you to try keeping those steps in mind.」


％Ｂ
「2, 2, 1... Do-re-mi, do-re-mi-fa-sol-la-ti...」
％Ｂ
「All right! I'll match the pitch this time for sure!」
Rikka
「Don't forget to record too.」
％Ｂ
「Right! Let's start, please!」
all
％Ｂ
「Do, reh. Miii, fuh, tso, lah～, tee, doooh.」
Rikka
「Now you're flat.」
％Ｂ
「This is hard...」
I play it back on my phone. It's like she says.
Rikka
「You should be able to pick up on the differences if you keep listening to your recordings like that.」

％Ｂ
「I'm starting to, but I just can't seem to fix them...」

Rikka
「We only started yesterday, didn't we? I think you wouldn't have to be doing this if you could learn all this right away.」

Rikka
「And you've improved a bit since yesterday. I'm sure you'll be able to do it if you keep fixing things bit by bit.」

％Ｂ
「Narusawa...」
Rikka
「And also... You should learn how to breathe with your diaphragm.」
％Ｂ
「Hih, hih, fuuuuh?」
Rikka
「...Are you pregnant?」
Rikka
「I'm talking about breathing from your abdomen. It'll make it easier to project your voice. Put your hand on your belly and try making a sound.」

％Ｂ
「Ahh, ahh, ahh.」
Rikka
「Your belly didn't move much at all, did it?」
％Ｂ
「Nope.」
Rikka
「So try it again, but now try pushing all the air out from deep in your belly, as hard as you can.」
％Ｂ
「Ahh! Ahh! Ahh!」
％Ｂ
「Whoa! It moved! And I think my voice was louder than the last time too!」

Rikka
「That's diaphragm breathing. It's hard to do at first, but you'll be able to do it if you keep it in mind.」

Rikka
「Putting a dictionary or some other heavy book on your stomach while you're lying face up on your bed makes for good practice.」

％Ｂ
「I get it. If I can lift the book up, I can do the diaphragm breathing.」
Rikka
「That's right.」
％Ｂ
「Okay, thanks. I'm starting to feel like I can do this.」
Rikka
「Come on, lunch break is going to be over if we don't hurry. Let's not waste valuable time.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah! Let's continue, please!」
Rikka
「...」
all
We gather up after school. Okihara-senpai and Ousaka apparently have something they wanna talk to Narusawa about.

Misa
「This is on the subject of our display. A silent display would be rather lonely, and so we wished to run some background music.」

Sora
「A song that fits the mood would be good.」
all
％Ｂ
「And so I had you come because I figured you'd know a lot of different songs.」
Rikka
「Yes, more than most people. But it's subjective whether or not a song fits the mood, so I think it would be best for Okihara-senpai and Ousaka-san to make the final choice.」


％Ｂ
「So you're okay with helping us?」
Rikka
「I am an event committee member, after all.」
Marika
「Mmm～ ...Then maybe we should all go to the CD store right now?」
all
Natsuki
「But I don't think we'd be able to listen to anything that wasn't a current hit. Oh! Rikka, don't you have lots of CDs at your house?」
all
Rikka
「I have a decent number of classical ones... but I don't have much in terms of popular music or jazz, just so you know.」

Natsuki
「That's more than enough! So anyway, who wants to go to Rikka's house right now?」
Rikka
「Wha...?」
Sora
「I'll go.」
all
Touko
「Huh, Piano-chan's house. I think I might be a bit interested.」
Yukimura, who had just kinda shown up earlier, is jumping on the bandwagon too.

all
Misa
「If it wouldn't be a bother, then I would love to!」

Rikka
「Whaaat...?」
Marika
「Oh, I... want to come too. Would it be... a bother?」
Rikka
「It wouldn't be a bother... You can come.」
Misa
「Thank you very much, Rikka-san.」
all
％Ｂ
「Excuse me～ ...Is this something that I am also allowed to be included in?」
Sora
「You're coming too
, Ryou

. Because you're a member of the event organization committee.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, but still. It's a girl's room.」
all
Touko
「Ahaha, you sure are perverted! Doesn't that mean you're already self-conscious about it?」

％Ｂ
「What!? Uh, oh...! But come on, it's actually a girl's room!」
all
Natsuki
「There appears to be a strange fellow who's so self-conscious about this it's creepy. What would you like to do, Narusawa-san?」

Rikka
「Maybe I shouldn't let him in...」
％Ｂ
「Narusawa!?」
all
Marika
「Wooow～ This is amaziiing～ I see lots of CDs and sheet music～」

Natsuki
「"A decent number," my butt! You've got enough to open up a shop!」

all
All of us voice our admiration once we step inside Narusawa's house.
There's a piano placed in the corner of the room. Bookshelves stuffed with CDs and sheet music.

Sora
「Are there any songs about stars?」

Misa
「I would also like to know if you have anything related to the ocean!」
Rikka
「The stars and the ocean, yes? I'll bring out a few pieces that fit the image in my mind, so just one moment.」


all
Touko
「This thing over here isn't moving at all.」
％Ｂ
「...」
Touko
「Tickle tickle～♪」
％Ｂ
「Wahyaaaahhh!?」
I make a strange sound when she tickles my side.
％Ｂ
「Wh-What are you doing, Yukimura?」
Touko
「I thought you were a piece of furniture because you weren't moving.」

Natsuki
「Maybe he was basking in the pleasure he felt from smelling Rikka's room?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah right I am!」
all
I just... was thinking, just a tiny bit... that it does smell nice... That's all!

Still, this is where Narusawa lives...
I know it's rude, but I can't stop myself from looking around.
The color scheme is mostly white. It's neatly organized, and very pretty.
We're all picking out a CD that looks like it'd fit our theme from the ones that Narusawa picks out.

Sora
「This one.」
Marika
「"Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star"?」
Touko
「Wouldn't it just be about stars, then?」
Misa
「I like it too. Doesn't it make you imagine a quiet nighttime sea, illuminated by the stars?」


％Ｂ
「I guess this kinda stuff really is subjective. Well if Okihara-senpai and Ousaka both like it, then it's fine, right? I think it's a good track too.」


Marika
「Looks like it's decided, then.」
Sora
「But there's one thing I don't get. Why are there more of the same CD...?」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, I was wondering about that too.」
all
Narusawa's brought a lot of CDs with the exact same contents.

Rikka
「Oh, but they're all completely different.」
Rikka
「They may all be the same piece, but different conductors and players make them all completely different. Even if it's the same people playing, their emotions and circumstances... all change how the piece sounds.」

Misa
「How incredible! It's as if the music is a living creature!」
Rikka
「Yes, it is. The same performance can never be played twice. Every single one is a once-in-a-lifetime event.」

％Ｂ
「Huh... Music's pretty deep.」
To be honest, I've never thought about it that much when I listened to music.
Maybe I should try comparing between different versions of the same piece too.
Narusawa sounds like she's really enjoying herself when she's talking about music. She must really like it.

Sora
「I understand. I want Ritsu's piano playing.」
Rikka
「Wha...?」
Sora
「If the sound's different, then I want Ritsu's performance for the display.」
Rikka
「...No one should have to listen to my piano playing.」
Misa
「That is not true! Your performances soothed and invigorated me when I would stay behind alone after school to take care of the jellyfish!」


all
Marika
「Me too... I may not know much about music... But I think it sounds really pretty.」

Touko
「You wouldn't be Piano-chan if you weren't good at piano.」

Natsuki
「Why not do it for them?」
all
％Ｂ
「It's up to you, of course, but I want you to play it too.」
％Ｂ
「I think it'd help make something more like what Okihara-senpai and Ousaka... no, something more like what we'd make.」

Rikka
「...Okay. I should have some sheet music for it...」
all
She traces her finger along the shelves packed with sheet music.
Rikka
「It should be somewhere around... Oh...?」
％Ｂ
「What's wrong?」
Rikka
「It should be here, but I can't find it.」
Rikka
「It might have gotten mixed up with something somewhere else, so I'll look for it a little more. Could we continue this tomorrow?」
％Ｂ
「I don't mind. Go for it.」
all
Ousaka and Okihara-senpai lower their heads in gratitude to Narusawa.
all
Natsuki
「Now then, what should we do with the time we've got left over?」

Rikka
「So you're planning on staying...」
Touko
「I want to look outside! We're high up here, right? The view must be great!」

all
Sora
「I need to investigate if this is closer to the stars than the school roof...」
％Ｂ
「You guys, don't run around like that in someone else's house.」
all
Rikka
「Sigh... I'll at least make you some tea, so don't break anything.」

Marika
「Oh, then I'll help you with that.」
all
It's been about four hours since Hino-kun and the others went home.
It's been about four hours since ％Ａ-kun and the others went home.
The overly big room's quiet. It's hard to believe it was so loud in here in the evening.

...Of course it's quiet. I'm the only one here.
Rikka
「I can't find it...」
There's no way I threw it out, so maybe Meguru took it with her...
Rikka
「...」
Maybe... I should call her.
Rikka
「! ...What? Meguru?」
My shock at the ridiculously perfect timing causes me to pause in accepting the call.

Rikka
「Hello?」
Meguru
『It's Onee-chan's voice!』
Rikka
「Hehe. You're calling my phone, so it would be strange if it were any other voice, wouldn't it?」

Meguru
『Maybe your boyfriend?』
Rikka
「...! I-I don't have anyone like that. So why are you calling today?」

Meguru
『Ahh, mhm. You see, I'm coming back next month.』
Rikka
「Wha... You mean, back to Shionagi?」
Meguru
『Mhm. What's it called again? ...That thing that your school does during its Tanabata Festival. Shio... Shio...』

Rikka
「The Shio-cademy Fest?」
Meguru
『That! I'm going to be in that. I have a few other jobs there too.』

Rikka
「Oh really. Is it going to be just you coming back?」
Meguru
『Mom's apparently busy with the music festival again this year. Eheheh, I'm looking forward to getting to see you again.』

Rikka
「Yeah, me too.」
Meguru
『I think I should be able to come back by the end of next month. I'll call you once I'm in Japan.』

Rikka
「I'll be waiting.」
Meguru
『Hey, Onee-chan. Did something good happen recently?』
Rikka
「What? Why?」
Meguru
『You sound a bit like you're having fun.』
Rikka
「Do I?」
Meguru
『Mhm. Could you tell me about it once I'm back? I have looots of things I wanna talk to you about too.』

Rikka
「Okay. Oh, that's right, Meguru. Do you know where the sheet music for "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star" is?」

Meguru
『I have it over here. Want me to bring it back with me?』
Rikka
「No, it's fine. Be careful when you're coming back.」
Meguru
『Ahaha, you're such a worrywart, Onee-chan. But thanks. I'll call you again, then. Bye-bye!』

Rikka
「Bye-bye. See you.」
_smh_st_04
I place my phone on the lid of the grand piano.
I slowly exhale.
Rikka
「...Meguru's... coming back.」
I gently touch the keys.
Discordance reverberates through the empty room.
