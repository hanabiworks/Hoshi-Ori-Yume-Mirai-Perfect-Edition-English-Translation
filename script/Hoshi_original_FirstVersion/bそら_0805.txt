「...Hup... Okay...」
We were all up late last night.
I'm the only one who's awake.
We don't have a sleeping area or anything, so they're all sleeping huddled together on the floor on top of some of the leftover cardboard.

Sora
「...Zzz... Zzz...」
Sora worked for longer than everyone else, but she eventually reached her limit too, and now she's sleeping with her head on my lap.

Sora
「...Nnh... nnh...」
％Ｂ
「Oh, my bad. Did I wake you up?」
Sora
「...What... time is it...?」
％Ｂ
「Let's see... It's 5. In the morning.」
Sora
「...You were awake the whole time...?」
％Ｂ
「Hm? Oh, yeah... We were so close to finishing, so I just figured I'd do it all at once.」

Sora
「...I'll help too.」
I gently push Sora back down as she tries to get up.
％Ｂ
「Don't worry, I'm already almost done. I'll go to sleep in a bit too, so you should just sleep.」

I stroke her soft hair, and she smiles happily.
Sora
「...Mm... Okay... I'll sleep a little more.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah... Good night.」
all
Sora
「...Good... night... Zzz... Zzz...」
I resume my work after checking to see she's gone to sleep.
％Ｂ
「All right... Just a little more.」
We all carry the parts up to the rooftop a little before noon.
First we put together the triangles to make the pentagons and hexagons.
Marika
「These don't lay flat once they come together.」
Shinozaki's right. The center of the polygons dip inward like a shallow plate once they're formed.


％Ｂ
「Yeah, that's how they're supposed to be. That way, the dome ends up more spherical when it all comes together.」

all
I show everyone the small soccer ball I got from Azuma-san.

％Ｂ
「This is how the pentagons and hexagons are gonna interlock.」
Natsuki
「Oh, this is easier to look off of than the blueprint.」

Misa
「Then let us all put it together, with this as our guide.」
all
We all look off of the soccer ball as we grab parts.
The parts are individually light, but the whole construct only gets heavier with every part that's added.

There are more sides to attach than the old dome, which means we need to be that much more careful about the assembly.
But there's a sense of satisfaction from fitting the edges together perfectly, like completing a jigsaw puzzle.


Touko
「It's kinda amazing this time around. It's really stable even though we're still in the middle of putting it together.」


Rikka
「It must mean it's just that sturdy.」
Misa
「I do not believe there is any worry of it collapsing with this.」
％Ｂ
「It should be fine, since I got Teacher's seal of approval on it.」
all
Natsuki
「Teacher?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. The architect I admire.」
all
Sora
「...Mo-san?」
％Ｂ
「Huh? Yeah, him. Mo-san.」
Sora
「...There's lots of people supporting us.」
Sora
「Mari, Misa, Natsu, Ritsu, Tou, the marketplace people, Mo-san... Everyone's supporting us as we make the planetarium... I'm so happy...」


％Ｂ
「Yeah... Everyone's looking forward to your planetarium.」
％Ｂ
「Let's make sure it's a success.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
all
And so, the last pentagon fits into place, and we fix it there with some white fabric tape.

Natsuki
「It's... done?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. It's complete.」

Marika
「Wow... Wow, wow～!」
all
Misa
「We've made something very wonderful!」
Rikka
「It's come out looking nice.」
all
Touko
「Ahh... We made it...」
all
％Ｂ
「We've completed this soccer-ball-inspired, polygon-design planetarium dome. And it's called―」

Marika
「Mhm, mhm?」
％Ｂ
「...」
％Ｂ
「...Sorry. I don't really have a name for it.」
Rikka
「What the heck...」
％Ｂ
「Anyone got any good names?」
Marika
「How about Dome-kun 2?」
all
Natsuki
「Then how about Star Dome Mk 2!」

Misa
「Perhaps the Starfall Room?」
all
Rikka
「The "Song of the Stars" planetarium.」
Touko
「Maybe the "Astronomy House" resting area.」
all
％Ｂ
「How about you, Sora?」
Sora
「..."Star Link."」


％Ｂ
「Huh?」
Sora
「...It's a place that connects the stars together.」
％Ｂ
「Connects the stars together... That's pretty nice.」
The "Star Link" Planetarium.


Yeah, not bad at all.
％Ｂ
「So we'll go with that for the―」
all
And that's when a gust of wind blows through.
Marika
「Kyaaah!」
Rikka
「Wha...!?」
Misa
「Oh my...」
A strong enough gust to flip everyone's skirts.
But my vision goes completely dark in an instant.
Sora
「...No looking.」
％Ｂ
「...Okay.」
I mean, no, that's not what I should be doing!
all
％Ｂ
「...What about the dome!?」
Everyone else also looks at the dome in unison.
The dome hasn't budged from the wind at all.
It stands solidly and firmly, thoroughly distributing its own weight throughout its structure.
％Ｂ
「All right!」
I clench my fist hard.
It's good this time.
The "Star Link" Planetarium's complete!


Sora
「...Everyone... Thank you.」
％Ｂ
「Sora...?」
Sora
「...I had you all help me lots... I caused you lots of trouble... You saved me lots...」

Sora
「...I was able to make it in time for the Tanabata Festival... thanks to you...」
Sora
「...But... I don't have anything I can do in return... I don't know how I can make it up to all of your...」

Marika
「We don't need any thanks～」
Natsuki
「That's right. We didn't help you because we wanted anything like that, Sora.」

Misa
「Doing one thing together with a large group is a very wonderful thing. I received help from you for the aquarium, so now we are even.」


Touko
「It was pretty fun. Was a nice way to kill time.」
Rikka
「Besides, it's still too early to thank us. The festival is tomorrow.」

％Ｂ
「Exactly. If you wanna thank us, then you've gotta nail the performance tomorrow. That's what we really want.」

Sora
「...*nod*」
Sora
「...I'll... do my best tomorrow.」
Natsuki
「Hey, let's do an advance screening!」
all
Marika
「Oh, I like that idea～」
all
Misa
「I would also like to see.」
Touko
「I think it's the least we could expect, as people who helped make it.」

Rikka
「More importantly, you were planning on doing it on the day of without a trial run? Isn't that the real issue here?」

％Ｂ
「You've got a good point... All right, let's do an advance screening!」
all
Sora
「...Oh.」
％Ｂ
「...Hm? What's wrong?」
Sora
「...We... still don't have the projector.」
％Ｂ
「We're gonna go grab it today, right?」
Natsuki
「Wait a second, are you going to be okay? You better not go to the store and find out it's closed today or something, okay?」

％Ｂ
「Haha, as if. We've made a reservation and everything. Right, Sora?」
Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「...Why'd you look away?」
Rikka
「Just go and rent it quickly. We won't be able to do anything without the projector.」

％Ｂ
「Y-Yeah, that's true. All right, let's go, Sora!」
Sora
「...*nod*」
Aghhh... I guess it's gonna be frantic until the very end.
But that's more our style.
And I'm sure all this is going to become great memories later on too.
The kinda ones we can all laugh about looking back.
