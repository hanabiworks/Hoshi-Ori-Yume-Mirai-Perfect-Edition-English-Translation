「Nnhh... All right... Finally lunch.」
Natsuki
「L-Let me take a photo of you!」
％Ｂ
「...Excuse me?」
Rikka
「...」
I have no idea what to say in response to Segawa's sudden request.
Narusawa's blankly looking at us too.
％Ｂ
「Uhh... What's going on?」
Natsuki
「R-Remember what I asked you about yesterday? About whether I could give away photos of you if there were any girls who wanted them...」

％Ｂ
「Y-Yeah...」

Rikka
「Wha... Are there any girls like that?」
％Ｂ
「It's just a hypothetical.」
Rikka
「Oh, I see.」
all
％Ｂ
「...Is there something you'd like to say, Narusawa-san?」
Rikka
「Not really. I'm going to go eat lunch now.」
all
％Ｂ
「Yesterday it was Shinozaki, today it's Narusawa... They're all just so...」
Is it that weird for a girl to want a photo of me...?
Natsuki
「H-Hey...」
％Ｂ
「Oh, sorry. Uhh... A photo? Anyway, it's like I said yesterday. You can take as many as you want if there are any girls who actually want one.」


Natsuki
「Y-Yeah... So I'm telling you to let me take some.」
％Ｂ
「But I'm about to go eat―」
％Ｂ
「...Wait... Huh? What? Did a girl like that appear?」

Natsuki
「...Yeah.」
％Ｂ
「This isn't a joke?」
Natsuki
「No.」
％Ｂ
「A photo of me? You're sure they want one of 
Hino Ryousuke
me
?」
Natsuki
「That's what I'm telling you...」
％Ｂ
「...Seriously!?」
％Ｂ
「Oh, man... I never thought there'd actually be a girl who wanted a photo of me...」

Natsuki
「...Are you happy?」
％Ｂ
「Mmm... Well, I guess it definitely doesn't feel bad.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, just to make sure, but it really is a girl, right? It's not some request from a dude or something, is it?」

Natsuki
「You'd be fine with just a photo either way, right?」
％Ｂ
「Uh... Y-Yeah... Though I'd definitely have to say no to anything more than that...」

Natsuki
「Don't worry. It's a girl.」
％Ｂ
「O-Oh, really... Okay then.」
Natsuki
「...I'll take one, then, okay?」
％Ｂ
「S-Sure... Wait, what should I do? Should I pose or something?」

Natsuki
「I'm going to take a bunch anyway, so just be casual.」
％Ｂ
「G-Got it.」
all
Casual. Casual...
％Ｂ
「...」
％Ｂ
「......」
％Ｂ
「.........」
Natsuki
「Come on... Why do you look so stiff?」
％Ｂ
「Uh... D-Do I? I'm trying to be casual...」

Natsuki
「Does casual mean standing at attention and staring at the camera for you? Relax a bit, and look like you're having a good time.」

％Ｂ
「Easier said than done...」
Natsuki
「Just try thinking of something fun that happened recently or something.」
％Ｂ
「Something fun that happened recently... What have I done again...?」
Natsuki
「Hey, come on... Haven't you forgotten something really fun you did just the other day?」

％Ｂ
「Just the other day... Uhh, nothing really happened yesterday, and I don't think anything happened the day before on Monday either... I just sat around the house all day on Sunday...」


Natsuki
「How about before that?」
％Ｂ
「Before that was Saturday, so let's see... Oh yeah, I went to the ocean with you, helped with your photography... Nothing really happened on Friday...」


Natsuki
「What are you just glossing over that for!? You had something fun happen on Saturday!」

％Ｂ
「The day we were doing photography?」
Natsuki
「You got to see me in a swimsuit.」
％Ｂ
「Oh... That's what you meant?」
Natsuki
「After you made such a perverted face, too.」
％Ｂ
「N-No, I didn't! I didn't have the time to do anything like that!」
Natsuki
「You totally were. You were staring right at my cleavage, especially when I was going underwater.」

％Ｂ
「N-No, I was nooot.」
Natsuki
「Yes, you weeere. And you were making funny sounds when we were touching too.」

Natsuki
「Wha!? Wait!? Hih!? Uih!? Woohooo! I think?」

％Ｂ
「The last one's wrong! Why do I sound so happy!?」
Natsuki
「Oh? You weren't happy?」
％Ｂ
「N-No, I wasn't.」
Natsuki
「My heart was beating really fast, though...」
％Ｂ
「...What?」
Natsuki
「Just kidding～ I was way too cold for that.」

％Ｂ
「Gh... Why, you...」
Natsuki
「What, have something to say?」
％Ｂ
「...Pff... Pffhaha...」
Natsuki
「What are you laughing for?」
％Ｂ
「It's just... You're trying to get me to relax, right? But the more we talk, the more we're arguing... It's the complete opposite of what you're trying to do... Pffhh...」


Natsuki
「O-Oh... Yeah, you're right... What am I doing?」
％Ｂ
「Haha, you're so sloppy... Ahaha!」
Natsuki
「Oh, I'll be taking that smile!」
all
Natsuki
「What do you think about this?」
She shows me the photo she took.
％Ｂ
「Uhh... I don't really know, since it's a photo of myself. Though I obviously don't think there's any problem with the subject, so if you think it's fine, then why not?」


Natsuki
「You think so? There's no problem with the cameraman's technique, but the subject's just...」

％Ｂ
「Come on, don't say that.」
Natsuki
「But I think it's a good photo.」
％Ｂ
「Okay. If you say so, then that's fine. I'm sure the person who asked for it will be happy too.」

Natsuki
「...Mm. Yeah.」
％Ｂ
「...? Segawa?」
Natsuki
「Ahaha, photos really live and die by the skill of the cameraman, don't they? You could be the most handsome guy in the world and you'd still look terrible if I caught you with your eyes half closed.」

％Ｂ
「Y-Yeah, that's true.」
Natsuki
「I'll go give her this photo right away, then.」
％Ｂ
「Right now?」
Natsuki
「She'd want it as soon as possible, right? I told her I'd get it ASAP. Oh, and you can't come, okay?」


％Ｂ
「S-Sure... Got it.」
Natsuki
「See you later, then.」
％Ｂ
「...」
all
That's weird... She seemed a little bothered still, even after she finished taking the photo.

Her tone sounded a little forced too...
Still though, so now there's going to be a girl out there with a photo of me...
...
...Uhh...?
Weird. I don't feel too happy...?
I don't have much time for lunch after the photo business.

I went to the school store before going back to the classroom, but there wasn't anything good left.
I've got white bread and margarine out on my desk.
％Ｂ
「I wish I could've at least gotten some jam or peanut butter...」
But I don't have any choice, so I spread the margarine on the bread and eat it.
％Ｂ
「Hamh... Mgmgh...」
Rikka
「...That's quite the sad lunch.」
％Ｂ
「Gulp... Yeah, I had to do something and it ended up taking up more time than I thought.」

Rikka
「Oh, where's Segawa-san?」
％Ｂ
「She's gone off to do something.」
Rikka
「Hmmh, it's rare for you two not to be together.」
％Ｂ
「Rare...? We're not always together, though.」
Rikka
「You're together in class, for lunch, and after school for committee work. How could you even say you're not always together?」

％Ｂ
「Oh...」
all
I never really thought about it, but she's right. We are always together...
Rikka
「Speak of the devil, I guess.」
％Ｂ
「H-Hey... Welcome back.」
Natsuki
「...」
all
％Ｂ
「...Uh?」
Rikka
「What, are you two not together right now because you had a fight?」
％Ｂ
「Huh? No, we didn't fight or anything.」
Rikka
「But she ignored you just now.」
％Ｂ
「No, she didn't ignore me, did she? I think she just didn't notice me 'cause she was zoning out.」


Rikka
「Zoning out... Well, it has nothing to do with me, so I don't care.」
all
But she definitely does seem different from earlier.
Did something happen?
all
％Ｂ
「Hamh... Mgmgh... Gulp.」
I shove the rest of the bread in my mouth and walk over to Segawa.
％Ｂ
「Yo. Something happen?」
Natsuki
「Huh? Oh, wh-what do you mean?」
％Ｂ
「You just seemed kinda down. Did... that person not end up liking that photo of me or something?」

Natsuki
「...What?」
％Ｂ
「I figured that was why you looked down.」
Natsuki
「O-Oh no, of course not. She liked it. She loved it. She loved it so much, she was praising the photographer's skill more than the subject.」

％Ｂ
「That seems like kind of a backwards, weird way of liking it.」
Natsuki
「...It's fine. She got a perfect photo. She's happy about every single part of it.」

％Ｂ
「O-Oh really. That's good then. I'm glad.」
Natsuki
「Are you happy too? Does knowing there's a girl out there who's interested in you make you feel like a bit of a winner?」

％Ｂ
「Mm, well, I guess...」
Like a winner, huh...
I was expecting to feel that way, but I just don't feel happy...
Natsuki
「Really. Well that's great. I'm glad you seem happy about it too.」

％Ｂ
「...Segawa?」
Natsuki
「...The first bell's going to ring soon. You should hurry up and get back to your seat.」

She's definitely acting a little strangely...
It doesn't seem like she's angry... I wonder what's going on.
all
I keep looking at Segawa while I take notes in class.
I sit diagonally behind her.
I can't see her face too clearly, but I can at least tell she seems a little more glum than usual.

Seeing her face like that... makes me feel kind of weird.
It's like there are tiny needles stuck in my throat.
We've been together a lot since I came to this school.
Or more like I've been with Segawa more than anyone else.
She's shown me lots of faces during that time.
I've seen her smile, and I've seen her get angry too.
I've seen her worry, pout, get embarrassed...
And... now I've seen her make this depressed, anguished expression.
％Ｂ
「...」
Crap.
I know I shouldn't be thinking anything like this, but even that expression of hers right now looks cute to me.

I can't help but be happy after seeing yet another new side of her.
Why is that...?
％Ｂ
「...Oh... I get it.」
It's such a simple answer that I voice my thoughts out loud without thinking.
English Teacher
「What's wrong
, Hino

? Have a problem with this example?」
％Ｂ
「Huh? Oh, no, it's nothing.」
English Teacher
「I see. So the problem lies with you for spacing out after eating.」
Everyone laughs at the teacher's joke.
Segawa's the only one who doesn't look at me.
Yeah. It's a simple answer.
I want to keep Segawa all to myself.
I want to know lots more about her.
That's how I feel. I don't know how Segawa feels...
But what I do know is that I shouldn't have told her it was okay to give that photo away.

After school.
It's time to start preparing for the Tanabata Festival once more.
But before that─
％Ｂ
「Segawa, can I talk to you for a bit?」
I walk over to her as she's stuffing her camera in her bag.
Natsuki
「Fueh!? Wh-What?」
％Ｂ
「It's about what we're doing after school today...」
Natsuki
「Oh, m-mhm. About that, I'll be doing grad-alb work today.」

Natsuki
「I've been focusing a bit too much on event committee stuff lately, so I need to do my main job too. There are other clubs getting ready for the festival as well, so I need to get some pictures of them working too.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, okay. I'll come too then─」
Natsuki
「You can prioritize your event committee stuff. Things might've settled down a bit for Misa-san right now, but you haven't helped the astronomy club at all yet, right?」


％Ｂ
「Well... But...」
Natsuki
「Then... See you tomorrow.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, wait...」
Rikka
「...You're right, it doesn't seem like she's ignoring you. Looks like she's just avoiding you.」

％Ｂ
「Avoiding me... Did it look that way?」
Rikka
「Didn't look like anything but. See you.」
all
I'm being avoided...?
You've gotta be kidding me. I wanna talk with her properly.
This won't get better with time.
I grab my bag and run out into the hallway.
Rikka
「Kyah! What's wrong
, Hino-kun

?」
％Ｂ
「You see which way Segawa went?」
Rikka
「Segawa-san? She was already gone by the time I stepped out.」
％Ｂ
「Okay. Thanks.」
all
Where would Segawa go...
She said she was going to take photos of the other clubs, so she should still be at school.
But that doesn't narrow things down. There are club activities all over the school, both inside and out.

％Ｂ
「I'll just look everywhere she might be.」
％Ｂ
「Shuuichi!」
Shuuichi
「Aaaagghhhh!?」
Shuuichi
「H-How many times do I have to tell you to knock!? ...Oh, it's you. I thought you were Segawa.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, it's me. Has Segawa come here?」
Shuuichi
「No, she hasn't. You're not with her today?」
％Ｂ
「She left 'cause she said she was going to be doing grad-alb stuff today.」

Shuuichi
「Hm? But you have to be with her for the grad-alb stuff too.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, it's just... Narusawa says it looked like she was avoiding me...」

Shuuichi
「Hmm. Go apologize to her, then.」
％Ｂ
「You're just assuming I did something wrong?」
Shuuichi
「Am I wrong?」
Shuuichi
「I've never even heard of Segawa avoiding someone with how friendly she is. If she's avoiding you, then there's no way the fault doesn't lie with you.」


％Ｂ
「Uh...」
Shuuichi
「Looks like you might have an idea why.」
Yeah... She's been acting weird ever since I told her it was okay to give that photo away to another girl...

％Ｂ
「I'm gonna go look for her.」
Shuuichi
「Yeah. Do your best.」
％Ｂ
「What's that supposed to mean?」
Shuuichi
「Nothing. Just figured I'd say it.」
all
Misa
「Oh, hello.」
Marika
「Thanks for your work today!」
％Ｂ
「Uh, has Segawa come here?」
Misa
「Natsuki-san? It appears she has yet to come for today...」
Marika
「Wait, why are you asking us? You should know better than we do, right
, Hino-kun

? Since you're in the same class.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, I should... but she left without me, saying she wanted to do grad-alb committee work.」

Marika
「If it's urgent, how about sending her a LIME message～?」

％Ｂ
「No, I wanna talk to her in person.」
Misa
「Oh, I see. So that's what is happening.」
％Ｂ
「What's happening...?」
Misa
「Oh no, it is simply that I now understand why your eyes look so filled with determination
, Ryousuke-san

.」

％Ｂ
「Huh? Do they?」
Misa
「Yes.」
Okihara-senpai might look kind of out of it, but I guess she's actually pretty perceptive.
％Ｂ
「There's something I'd like to speak with her about today.」
Misa
「I see. Please, do your best.」
Marika
「Oh, I get it. So it's finally time.」
Misa
「The two of them come as a set at this point, after all. Ufufu.」
I walked through the old school building and the main school building, but I didn't see Segawa anywhere.
Maybe she went home already...?
No, I really don't think she'd give up the opportunity to take pictures while we're still in the middle of club activities.

So is she on the grounds, then...?
...Just looking around with no leads might be risky. I don't have much time.
％Ｂ
「...Guess I have no other choice.」
％Ｂ
「Ousaka!」
Sora
「...?」
％Ｂ
「Let me borrow the telescope for a bit.」
Sora
「...It isn't ideal for stargazing yet.」
％Ｂ
「No, it's not for stargazing. I want to look around the school a bit.」

Sora
「...Peeping isn't good.」
％Ｂ
「I'm not peeping. I'm looking for something important.」
Sora
「...Natsu?」
％Ｂ
「...Natsu? ...Oh, yeah. I'm looking for Segawa.」
Sora
「Why aren't you together today?」
％Ｂ
「It'll take too long to explain, so I'll spare you the details.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
Sora
「I think you should hurry and apologize.」
％Ｂ
「...So... So you're saying that too...」
I'm amazed at how much people believe in Segawa.
Sora
「...I saw Natsu.」
％Ｂ
「Seriously? Where?」
Sora
「She was walking through the second-floor hallway an hour ago. On the edge of the grounds forty-five minutes ago. Behind the old school building thirty minutes ago.」


％Ｂ
「...You're peeping pretty hard yourself.」
Sora
「She didn't take a single photo the whole time. It was strange for Natsu.」

％Ｂ
「...」
Sora
「And you're the only one who can make Natsu behave like that
, Ryou

.」
％Ｂ
「What? Really?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
Sora
「Natsu's really energetic when she's next to you
, Ryou

. She seems really happy.」

Sora
「I'm grateful to you and Natsu. You gave me the opportunity to participate in the Tanabata Festival. And you said you'd help me.」





Sora
「That's why I don't want this situation. As a member of the astronomy club.」
％Ｂ
「Just as a member of the astronomy club?」
Sora
「Even more so for me personally.」
％Ｂ
「...?」
Sora
「It's fun seeing you and Natsu together. It's not fun to see one of you missing the other.」




Sora
「I won't ask about the reason, but if there's a way to resolve this, then you should do it quickly.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, it isn't fun... It's not fun for anyone.」
Sora
「*nod*」
She points at the telescope.
Looks like she wants me to look through it.
all
I put my eye against the eyepiece. The field of view shows the inner courtyard.

And I see Segawa sitting on a bench, looking at her camera.
％Ｂ
「Segawa...!」
Sora
「...
Ryou. 

Go.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. Thanks, Ousaka!」
I thank Ousaka while I run and sprint down the stairs.
I leap down the stairs.
I don't care how dangerous it is. I want to get to Segawa as quickly as possible.

My shoes squeak against the landing.
％Ｂ
「Oh, yeah, I met Segawa here for the first time.」
And then I transferred in, and met her again.
We've been together for breaks between classes and after school.
She's always been by my side no matter what.
I want her to stay by my side from now on too.
I want to see more new sides of her.
That's why I─
Natsuki
「...Sigh... I'm just not feeling it today... I can't take any good photos like this...」

％Ｂ
「Segawa!」
Natsuki
「Eek!? Huh? Oh, 
Hino
why are you...
!?」
％Ｂ
「Hahh, hahh, hahh... Hahh... Haahh...」
Natsuki
「Wha... Oh... Wh-What's wrong? Did something happen with the event committee?」
％Ｂ
「No... I haven't done anything for the event committee today.」
Natsuki
「...What? Wh-Why not?」
％Ｂ
「I had something more important to do.」
Natsuki
「Oh, really...」
％Ｂ
「Uhh... About that photo of me. You already gave that away, right?」

Natsuki
「The one from lunch...? That photo...? Yeah, since you said it was okay...」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, I figured.」
Natsuki
「You didn't want me to...? Or maybe you wanted to know who I gave it to?」

Natsuki
「Yeah, I can see why you'd wanna know. You already know she's interested, so it's possible that you'd get her right away if you went for it～」


％Ｂ
「Uh... No, well, I feel kinda bad about that girl who's interested in me... but I want a photo too.」

Natsuki
「Hmm...」
Natsuki
「...」
Natsuki
「What!? A-A photo? Of a girl?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, there's this girl I've been interested in for a while. I want a photo, sent as data.」
I pull my phone out of my pocket and hold it up to her.
Natsuki
「Oh... O-Okay... I do data, so that's fine... There's file size limits, so I'll need to put it on my computer first...」

Natsuki
「B-By the way... whose photo? Is it someone I know, maybeee...?」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, you know her.」
Natsuki
「Oh... Oh, really... Someone I know, huh... Though I guess I know pretty much everyone at this school.」

She gives a faltering smile.
I start up the camera app on my phone.

Natsuki
「...If there's anything I can do to help... Yeah, I'll help.」

I point my phone's camera lens at Segawa...
％Ｂ
「...Then─」
And place her squarely in the middle of the on-screen frame.
Natsuki
「Wha...?」
__photo_nt0625_01
Natsuki
「...? ...??」
％Ｂ
「...Got it.」
Natsuki
「Wha... What? What? What?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah... You look a little lost, but it came out pretty nicely. See?」
I show her the photo I took.
Natsuki
「Wh-What the heck... What's going on?? Why'd you take a photo of me...??」

％Ｂ
「It's like I said. I wanted a photo of the girl I've been interested in for a while.」
Natsuki
「Huh? Th-Then... Y-You, you meant me...? You're kidding...」
％Ｂ
「I'm not kidding. I don't really know if I realized, or if I was made to realize... but there's something inside me that I was taking for granted.」


％Ｂ
「I wanted to see your face when you're smiling, when you're angry, when you're serious, when you're pouting, when you're embarrassed... I wanted to do stuff with you and have you show me lots of sides of you.」

％Ｂ
「I thought it was natural that I'd get to see those faces.」
％Ｂ
「But I realized there are probably lots of other faces too...」
％Ｂ
「Faces that I'm sure I wouldn't get to see if we stayed just friends...」

％Ｂ
「That's why I wanted to take another step closer to you.」
％Ｂ
「I want to go out with the girl I like, and learn lots more about her.」
Natsuki
「Go... Go out with... Aha... Ahahah... But that's just...」
％Ｂ
「...You don't want to?」
Natsuki
「It-It's not like I don't want to... or like I don't not want to... It's more like I can't believe it... or like, I'm surprised...」

％Ｂ
「...」
Natsuki
「...I'm really rough around the edges, you know...」
％Ｂ
「I know.」
Natsuki
「I'm not honest with myself... I'm always messing with my camera...」
％Ｂ
「I know that too.」
Natsuki
「And... I'm a pain... in lots of other ways too...」
％Ｂ
「I know all of that.」
Natsuki
「Wh-What do you mean, all of that... There's stuff you don't know, you know...!」

％Ｂ
「That's why I want you to teach me. I want to find out more about the Segawa Natsuki I don't know.」

％Ｂ
「And I want you to find out more about the 
Hino Ryousuke
me 
\nyou don't know... while we're dating.」

Natsuki
「The 
Hino 
you 
I don't know...?」
％Ｂ
「Though if you don't really wanna know more, then there's nothing I can do about that.」
Natsuki
「No... No, I wanna know! I want to know more about you too!」

％Ｂ
「Th-Then... Uh... Will you go out with me?」
Natsuki
「...」
％Ｂ
「Segawa...?」
Natsuki
「...Here...」
She suddenly takes out her phone and holds it out with the screen facing me.
％Ｂ
「...Hm?」
Her lock screen's a photo of me.
It's the one she took today at lunch.
％Ｂ
「...Why do you have this photo here?」
Natsuki
「...～～～～」
Natsuki
「...The... The girl who wanted your photo was... um... me...」

％Ｂ
「Huh? But then what about that girl yesterday?」
Natsuki
「That was a request for a photo of some other guy... Talking to her... m-made me realize... I wanted a photo of you too.」


％Ｂ
「You should've just said so, then.」
Natsuki
「I-I couldn't! I... already told you that I'd just tell the person I like myself, without wanting a photo...」


Natsuki
「So I couldn't say it...」
％Ｂ
「Oh yeah, you seemed real proud of that, after all. But why were you so depressed after you got a photo of me, then?」

Natsuki
「That's because... you said it was okay to give the photo away.」
Natsuki
「I thought that if you were interested in me, then you wouldn't want me to give your photo to another girl...」

Natsuki
「But you just said okay...」
％Ｂ
「I... Yeah. That was my bad.」
％Ｂ
「But I want you to know that the reason I was able to relax so much when you were taking that photo was 'cause I was thinking of you. Being with you is what's fun for me.」


Natsuki
「Stu...Stupid... Don't say things like that so seriously. You're making me embarrassed...」

％Ｂ
「Don't worry. I'm pretty embarrassed myself for saying it...」
I can tell my face is all hot.
Natsuki
「Is it... okay for me to be your girlfriend...?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. And it's okay for me to be your boyfriend too, right?」
Natsuki
「Really... Ahaha... I'm so happy it's kinda scary...」
％Ｂ
「I'll be in your care.」
Natsuki
「Yeah... I will be in your care!」
So now we're boyfriend and girlfriend...
It still hasn't really struck home for me yet, but I'm sure I'll gradually start feeling the way I should about it.

From now on, even if we still do the same things as we've been doing up until now, they'll become memories of our time together as lovers instead of as friends.

Natsuki
「Oh, wait a second.」
％Ｂ
「Huh? Y-You're taking it back already!?」
Natsuki
「No! That photo you took earlier.」
％Ｂ
「This?」
I pull it up on my phone and show her.
Natsuki
「Delete it...」
％Ｂ
「Why? I like it a lot, though.」
Natsuki
「But it's kinda weird. I'm not smiling, and I don't look composed. It just caught me by surprise...」


％Ｂ
「Yeah. It's a photo of you, just the way you are.」
Natsuki
「No it's not! Seriously, please! I'll let you take a proper one sometime!」

％Ｂ
「How about now?」
Natsuki
「Huh?」
％Ｂ
「How about we take a photo of us together?」
Natsuki
「What? What? Wh-What the heck? That's super embarrassing, though!」

％Ｂ
「But it's totally what a couple would do.」
Natsuki
「Oh... M...Mhm...」
％Ｂ
「Then... Come here...」
Natsuki
「...Okay.」
％Ｂ
「Okay... Like this, I guess...?」
Natsuki
「I-Isn't this too close?」
％Ｂ
「Hm? The camera?」
Natsuki
「O-Our faces...」
％Ｂ
「You think so...? Oh, you smell kinda nice.」
Natsuki
「～～～～! H-Hurry up and take the photo! I'm going to die of embarrassment!」
％Ｂ
「Fine. Say cheese!」

That night─
I'm looking at the photo I took with Segawa on my phone.

...Crap, I'm grinning...
So this is how all of the guys with girlfriends feel.
I wonder how school's going to look to me starting tomorrow...
It's just a small step forward, but it feels huge to me.
％Ｂ
「Hm...?」
A message from Segawa?
【Natsuki】「Can I call you right #Nnow?」
【Natsuki】_st_0203
％Ｂ
「...Holy crap... That's so cute...」
It's a casual, naturally worded message.
And yet, it seems so special to me.
I select Segawa's phone number from my contacts.

Natsuki
『H-He-He, hewwo!?』
％Ｂ
「Wow, you picked up instantly.」
Natsuki
『B-Because you called just when I was looking at my phone... I didn't think you'd just call without responding on LIME.』

％Ｂ
「You asked if you could call, so I decided to call.」
Natsuki
『Mhm... I didn't really have anything specific to talk about... but...』
％Ｂ
「Yeah...?」
Natsuki
『I just... kinda wanted to hear your voice.』



％Ｂ
「...That makes me way happier than you having something specific to talk to me about.」
Crap... I'm starting to grin again.
I can't stop my face from feeling warmer knowing that Segawa's there on the other end of the line.

Natsuki
『What were you up to?』
％Ｂ
「Uhh... I was looking at a photo.」
Natsuki
『A photo? Of what?』
％Ｂ
「That photo of us we took at school.」
Natsuki
『Uh... Y-You were looking at that...? I was actually doing the same thing... and that's why I wanted to hear your voice.』

％Ｂ
「It's kinda embarrassing, huh?」
Natsuki
『Yeah.』
Our sentences are shorter than usual.
And yet it feels like every word, every syllable is packed with our feelings.
Who knew a phone call with your girlfriend would feel so ticklish?
And that it would be so fun?
All we're doing is talking about what happened today, but it's so much fun.
Natsuki
『Ahaha, that's what they said to you?』
％Ｂ
「Yeah... I get that they were all worried, but I guess they just assumed it was all my fault.」

Natsuki
『How about we explain things properly to everyone tomorrow?』
％Ｂ
「Explain things...? As in, tell them that we're dating now? Yeah, that's not a bad idea.」

Natsuki
『Uh... I meant it as a joke... but you're serious?』
％Ｂ
「I don't really wanna have to be secretive about it, and I think it'll make it easier to work with everyone if we just tell them.」

Natsuki
『You know... You occasionally get really bold, you know that? ...But I guess you have a point.』

％Ｂ
「Right?」
To be honest, I personally want everyone to acknowledge our relationship.

There won't be any guys who'll try to go for Segawa that way...

Uh... I really do want to keep her all for myself, don't I...?
Natsuki
『I wonder if they're going to ask lots of questions? Like who confessed first, or when we started liking each other, or how far we've gone, or how many kids do we want.』


％Ｂ
「Uh... I don't think they'll ask all that...」
Natsuki
『They definitely will. It's going to be a really thorough interrogation. I know it's what I'd do!』

％Ｂ
「That's 'cause it's you...」
It looks like our fun night's going to continue for a while yet...
