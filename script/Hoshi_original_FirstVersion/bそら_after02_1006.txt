The exterior of Shuuichi's house is done by October.
Shuuichi
「Ohh... Oohhhhh! It's definitely a capital-L Love Nest for Kaori and me! I love it!」

％Ｂ
「R-Really...」
I was personally going for a "spacious and stylish" design...

Well, if "capital-L Love Nest" is what he wants, then that's fine...
Shuuichi
「When's this going to be fully completed?」
％Ｂ
「It's progressing pretty steadily, so the interior'll be done by December. You'll be able to live in it by the end of the year if you want.」

Shuuichi
「So I'll be able to welcome the new year in a new home! I like the sound of that! Thanks so much, man.」

％Ｂ
「What are you talking about? I should be the one thanking you for deciding to entrust a newly opened firm with something as big as a house.」

We exchange a firm handshake and thank each other.
I head to Azuma-san's firm in the afternoon.
It's to have him check over the final blueprint for the cultural hall that I've drafted.

％Ｂ
「...What do you think?」
Azuma
「Yeah... Hmmh...」
％Ｂ
「U-Um...? Is there a problem of some sort?」
Azuma
「...Not good...」
％Ｂ
「...What!?」
Azuma
「I don't have anything left to complain about.」
％Ｂ
「Wha... Please don't do that. You're going to give me a heart attack.」
Azuma
「Still though, I'm surprised you've done this well on your first facility design. It's impressive.」

％Ｂ
「Thank you very much.」
No matter what happens, it always makes me happy when Azuma-san praises me.

Azuma
「The rest's up to my firm now. You can move onto a different job now.」

％Ｂ
「But I need to be there for the meeting with the contractors―」
Azuma
「I told you it's up to us, didn't I? Just let us handle it. It's a distributed effort.」

％Ｂ
「Uh huh...」
...Wait a second, did Azuma-san take on all of the bureaucratic work so I could fully concentrate on the design and blueprint drafting...?


％Ｂ
「...」
Well, I doubt he'd give me an answer if I asked him.
He's never honest when it comes to these sorts of things...
Azuma
「What? You still got something you wanna say?」
％Ｂ
「...Thank you very much... Teacher.」
I bow my head low to him.
I try to communicate all of my gratitude and thoughts with the gesture.
Azuma
「...Hmph... Either way, don't worry about it. I'll still have you come by when construction's about to start, though.」

all
He waves me away and leaves the room.\n \n\r

I bow my head low once more to his back.
Sora
「...Good evening.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, evening.」
Sora shows up after work while I'm finishing up some work.
She seems excited in general.
Sora
「...I want to show you something.」
％Ｂ
「Hm? What?」
She pulls out a small vial about three centimeters tall from her bag.

There's white, star-shaped sand inside.
％Ｂ
「Oh, it's star sand!」
Sora
「...It got delivered to the science museum today.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, this is what I was talking about!」
Sora
「...We're planning on handing them out in bags labeled with "Shooting Star Children."」
％Ｂ
「I like it. I bet the kids'll love it. I think it's just the something extra you wanted for your show.」

Sora
「...*nod*」
Sora
「...Hearing you say that makes me feel more confident. Thank you, Ryou.」

Sora
「...Hearing you say that makes me feel more confident. Thank you.」

％Ｂ
「I hope it goes well. I just submitted the blueprint for the cultural hall to Teacher today myself. That's one big job done.」


Sora
「...That's good. Can you take a bit of a break now?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. Let's line up our breaks sometime next month or so and take a trip together. I'm pretty tired, so I wanna relax a little.」

Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「How about we see the stars from some hot springs again?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「We'll do that, then.」
We imagine our hot springs trip for next month as we look at the star sand.
As if we were making a wish on the "Shooting Star Children" in our hands.
