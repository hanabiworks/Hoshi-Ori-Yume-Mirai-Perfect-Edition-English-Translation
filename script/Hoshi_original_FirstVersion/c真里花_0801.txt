「Ohh...」
Marika
「Pretty...」
None of us can string together a sentence with the starry sky projected before us.
A starry sky I've never seen before with the naked eye.
Spanning the ceiling right here in front of us.
Our Mk. 2's finally complete.
Natsuki
「Did we really make this? I can't really believe it...」

Segawa's staring at the starry sky, forgetting to even take photos.
％Ｂ
「That's right. This is the planetarium we've made.」
all
Misa
「It's wonderful... Absolutely splendid.」

Touko
「It's really something.」
Rikka
「To think that those holes we hated making so much would turn into such pretty stars.」
all
Sora
「...Oooh... Ohhh...」
Ousaka's lost in the starry sky too.
She looks absolutely delighted.
She really loves the stars.
all
％Ｂ
「Then shall we try a simulation of the real deal?」
The real deal would be to combine the starry sky and the aquarium, and accompany them with a narration of both.\n\r

Okihara-senpai and Ousaka are to switch off.
Misa
「Then I will begin...」
The script's already been written between the two of them.
Misa
「We thank you very much for visiting the stargazing aquarium today...」

Misa
「The Milky Way Galaxy. Cradled within the Orion arm of this galaxy is an ocean planet. Its name is Earth. It is a blue planet, teeming with life...」


Okihara-senpai's voice rings out beautifully and fantastically, like the nighttime ocean.
We're planning on having her use a microphone for the actual day, so it might end up a little different.\n\r

Maybe we could try adding a bit of echo or something too.
all
I find myself lost in her beautiful narration as I think.\n \n\r

Everyone seems to be the same way. We're all standing still, just listening.
The narration is supposed to be about fifteen minutes long, with the ocean and sky combined.
I suddenly come back to my senses, and check the time to see that ten minutes have already passed.

％Ｂ
「...Hm?」
That's when I notice something.
No. That might have been why I came back to my senses in the first place.
％Ｂ
「...Does anyone smell something burning?」
Marika
「Huh? ...Oh, you're right...」
The others give a start too.
all
Misa
「...Now that you mention it, I do too...」

Rikka
「It's the smell of something bad burning. Like something plastic...」

％Ｂ
「Plastic...」
all
Sora
「...The planetarium!」
Ousaka uncharacteristically shouts.
That's when I realize what's happened.
all
I rush over to find a bit of smoke rising from our Planetarium Mk. 2.

％Ｂ
「Crap!!」
I frantically turn it off.
The room goes dark for a moment, and then Marika pulls aside the curtains.
％Ｂ
「No way...」
I hastily reach out toward it.
％Ｂ
「Hoooottt...!?」
But it's too hot to touch.
Natsuki
「Wh-What? Why?」
％Ｂ
「It's melted...」
Part of the acrylic's melted and fell apart.
％Ｂ
「I get it... So that's what happened.」
I quickly piece it together.
It's almost frustrating how easy it is to figure out. Why couldn't I have realized sooner?

％Ｂ
「We used a big incandescent bulb to increase the amount of light, which also increased the amount of heat produced.」

％Ｂ
「And there was nowhere for the heat to escape because of the sealed environment, so the heat from the light bulb melted the acrylic...」

Marika
「Oh no...」
all
Everyone's speechless at the pitiful state of the acrylic hemispheres that we all spent so much time opening holes in.

It was showing us such a beautiful starry sky just now, but now it's like this...

I was aware of the heat, but I didn't think it'd be enough to melt the plastic.

It's because I never tried doing any long-duration experiments.
This is 100 percent my fault.
Touko
「...What are we going to do?」
So Yukimura asks...
％Ｂ
「...」
But neither I nor anyone else have any answers.
