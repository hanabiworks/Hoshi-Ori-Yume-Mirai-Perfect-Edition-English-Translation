【Sora】「Morning#NAwake?」
【％Ｂ】「Morning. I just woke up.」
【Sora】「Good#NI'll see you at school, #Nthen」
【Sora】_st_0310
...Uhh... Today's July 5th...
Which means...
【％Ｂ】「Just so you know, #Ntoday's Saturday. No #Nschool today.」

％Ｂ
「...Hello?」
Sora
『...Sorry... I did it out of habit...』
％Ｂ
「Uh... It's fine. I figured it was something like that.」
Sora seriously woke me up every single day this past week.
It's pretty cute how she even woke me up today, on a day when we don't have school.

Sora
『...Sleep again.』
％Ｂ
「Actually, can we talk a bit while we're on the phone?」
Sora
『...*nod*』
％Ｂ
「I've been thinking of some stuff for the planetarium.」
Sora
『Your exam prep...』
％Ｂ
「I'm fine on that front. I've been following that schedule I told you about before.」

％Ｂ
「Anyway, so I think that the best way to keep the budget down is to make as much as we can ourselves.」

Sora
『I was thinking the same thing. But we can't make everything ourselves.』
％Ｂ
「Yeah. Pretty much only the dome.」
Sora
『...We can make that?』
％Ｂ
「I actually found a lot of websites showing how people used homemade planetarium domes.」

％Ｂ
「We'll definitely wanna rent a legitimate projector.」

I considered making the projector by hand too, but I doubt we'd end up with something befitting the kind of planetarium Sora wants to make.


％Ｂ
「And so... Uh, about the rental fees for the projectors...」
Sora & ％Ｂ
Sora
『I'll earn it working part-time.』
％Ｂ
「I'll earn it working part-time.」
％Ｂ
「Hm?」
Sora
『...We said the same thing.』
That was the best plan I could think of for making the planetarium into reality. 
And it looks like Sora thought the same thing.
％Ｂ
「Shuuichi said he didn't mind if we did fundraising, so I don't think there'd be any issue if we used our own personal funds. I bet bigger clubs have every member pitch in 500 yen and stuff anyway.」


Sora
『...*nod*』
％Ｂ
「So if the two of us work, then getting 70,000─」
Sora
『...I can't let you do that much
, Ryou

. No issues if it's just me.』
％Ｂ
「We'll have the money sooner if we're both working, and we'll be able to get started on what we need to do sooner that way too.」

Sora
『It's my fault the club has no money. And it wouldn't be good for your standing in the event committee if you help the astronomy club too much.』




％Ｂ
「You mean, like... they'd say it's mixing work and private affairs?」
Sora
『...*nod*』
％Ｂ
「But I wanna help you, as your boyfriend.」
Sora
『...I won't be able to say no if you say that. But I'm still worried about your standing in the event committee...』




％Ｂ
「Hmm... It'd be best if I could get a job without anyone knowing...」

％Ｂ
「...Either way, let's decide on the specifics of working after exams.」
Sora
『...*nod*』
％Ｂ
「Let's get past the exams first.」
Sora
『...
Ryou
Um
...』
％Ｂ
「Hm?」
Sora
『...Thank you.』
％Ｂ
「It's nothing. Anyway, can we talk a little more for now?」
Sora
『...No issues.』
Sora
『...I want to talk more with you too. Just lunch break isn't nearly enough time.』




％Ｂ
「Yeah, seriously.」
I talk lots with Sora for the first time in a while.
As if to make up for the time that we had lost after school this week.
It's our way of taking a bit of a breather before the exams.
It's always great to refresh your heart like this.
Thanks to that, I ended up making better progress than ever before on my studying for the rest of the day.
