We finished cutting out the parts by the end of yesterday.
Everything we painted this morning's dried by the afternoon.
We now have all of the parts we need.
Marika
「What do we do next?」

Sora
「...We will be taking the parts to the rooftop, and then we will put them together.」
all
Touko
「Why's Fluffyhead suddenly talking different?」
％Ｂ
「She's in training. Just talk to her the way you always do.」
I pull up the weather app on my phone while I talk to Yukimura.
all
％Ｂ
「Okay, no sign of rain. Looks like the rooftop's good. Though it's more like we're just seeing how the pieces line up, right?」

Sora
「...*nod*」

Rikka
「Ousaka-san.」
Sora
「...Yes.」
It appears Narusawa-sensei is quite the strict teacher.
We all grab the parts and head to the roof.
Sora
「We'll... We will be taking all of the parts that are of the same size and taping their sides together. There are 36 each of nine different types, so I will be... counting on you.」

all
We all start taping the parts together under Sora's unnaturally formal guidance.\n\r

We're using masking tape so it'll be easy to peel off later.
The parts that have been built according to Sora's exact calculations come together perfectly, like puzzle pieces.

We form a grand six-meter-diameter ring with the 36 biggest parts. It's the lowest tier of the dome.

We continue on from there to build more rings of decreasing diameter.
Eventually, we finish all nine rings.
Sora
「...Stacking these parts in order will complete the dome. We'll be... We will be creating an entrance for the day of, but we'll... we will cut that out once the dome has been secured.」


％Ｂ
「Let's try stacking the parts for now. It'll be good to see if there's any last-minute stuff we need to do in case we made a mistake somewhere.」

Sora
「Yes.」
all
First, we combine the nine parts into three groups of three to form the large upper, middle, and lower tiers.

％Ｂ
「We'll start with the upper and middle parts.」
I place the smallest of the three, the "canopy," on top of the middle part.

Marika
「Wow, it's a perfect fit!」
Natsuki
「It doesn't look like there's any gaps from what I can see.」
％Ｂ
「Let's put these on top of the bottom, then.」
We all stand at regular intervals around the middle part's circumference and pick it up.
It may just be made of cardboard, but it's big and pretty heavy.

We carry it over so it's parallel with the upper edge of the bottom part and coordinate the lowering.

Touko
「Piano-chan, you're a little too high up!」

Rikka
「Like this?」
all
Misa
「Sora-san, are you okay?」
Sora
「...There are no issues.」
％Ｂ
「Okay, let's lower it. Slowly now, everyone.」
all
We all slowly lower the middle and upper parts onto the bottom part, making sure to keep them parallel with respect to one another.

And...
Touko
「We're done...」
Natsuki
「Yeah...」
Rikka
「...Is it really finished?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. It's just a fitting for now... but it's done!」
We've completed the construction of a very respectable six-meter-diameter projection dome.
Marika
「Wooow～! It really did turn into a proper dome!」

Misa
「What a wonderful dome.」
all
Natsuki
「I've gotta get a photo of this! Even outside of grad-alb stuff!」

Marika
「Oh, I wanna take a photo too.」
Misa
「I will also take a commemorative photo.」
We all hold up our phones toward the completed, handmade dome.
I hear a series of clicks and dings as our various camera apps' shutters go off.
all
Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「What do you think, Sora? Is this good?」
Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「Sora?」
Sora
「...I was a little captivated.」
Captivated?
Sora
「...It came out really good... A lot better than what I was imagining... That's why I was captivated.」


Sora's reverted to her usual way of speaking.
She must be just that moved by the dome.
％Ｂ
「I see... That's great.」
I pat Sora on the head.
She looks at me and smiles.
Natsuki
「Hey, so I wanna try going inside. Can I?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, that's a good idea. We need to check to see how dark it is inside too. Let's go, Sora.」

Sora
「...*nod*」
all
We don't have an entrance made yet, so we pick up the entire dome and squeeze in through the gap.

We all get inside the dome.
Marika
「Wow, it's so dark～」
Touko
「I can't really tell because it's so dark. How many people can fit in this?」
Rikka
「I think it could fit about thirty people.」
Misa
「I am sure this planetarium will be completely filled.」
％Ｂ
「Yes. The people who come to see will be very satisfied with a dome this nice. Right, Sora?」


...No response.
％Ｂ
「Sora?」
Sora
「...Everyone... Thank you all very much.」
％Ｂ
「Wha...?」
Sora
「...If you all hadn't helped... I would not have been able to make such an impressive dome... So... Thank you very much.」


％Ｂ
「Sora...」
％Ｂ
「...Why'd you say it in the dark?」
Rikka
「You could've just thanked us outside.」
Touko
「Mmm... Maybe it's because she's embarrassed?」
Natsuki
「I bet her face is bright red right now.」
Marika
「You're so cute, Ousaka-san～」
I feel something squeeze tight against my waist.
I can immediately tell it's an embarrassed Sora.
Sora
「...Uuuh～」
Misa
「Shall we all leave, then?」
And as expected, Sora's red with embarrassment when we leave the dome.

all
Natsuki
「Phew, it's a bit hot in there.」
％Ｂ
「There'll be some airflow once we cut the entrance into it, so that should make things better. We can't do too much about it other than that.」


Marika
「I'm a little thirsty now.」
Natsuki
「Oh, I know. Let's make a toast! And some photos to celebrate! Let's take a group photo to commemorate.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, that's a good idea. I'll go buy drinks, then. What do you guys want?」

Natsuki
「Ginger ale! Ginger ale ginger ale!」
Marika
「I'll have some cold tea.」
all
Misa
「I would like to request some orange juice.」
Rikka
「Anything that isn't carbonated is fine by me.」
Touko
「Something sweet.」
Everyone wants something completely different again...
all
％Ｂ
「What about you, Sora?」
Sora
「...I will go together with you
, Ryou

. I will decide once I am there.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah? Okay, let's get going, then.」
％Ｂ
「It's great that it came out nicely.」
Sora
「...Yes, it is.」
％Ｂ
「Though I guess it's the obvious conclusion since we've been real careful with everything from the templates onward. I'd be pretty depressed if it ended up awful after all that effort.」


Sora
「...It is... really all thanks to everyone's efforts.」
％Ｂ
「Sora, it's just me, so you can act like usual.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
There we go. That's more like it.
％Ｂ
「I'm really looking forward to the Tanabata Festival.」
Sora
「...Me too.」
％Ｂ
「We're gonna go rent the projector the day before, right?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「I wanna hurry up and actually put some stars up on that dome.」
We'll only be able to rent the projector for a short period of time, so we'll need to do it right before we need it.

Sora
「...It's my turn next. I'll give a talk that's worthy of that dome...」

％Ｂ
「Yeah.」
Sora
「...And I'll get yelled at by Ritsu too.」
％Ｂ
「Haha, Narusawa-sensei's pretty spartan. But you've been getting better bit by bit.」

Sora
「...Really?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. There's still time, so let's do our best.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
We go back up to the roof, our arms laden with various drinks.
％Ｂ
「We brought the driiinks.」
Sora
「...Hgh...!」
Sora suddenly stops dead.
％Ｂ
「Hm? What's wrong?」
Marika
「Oh...」
Shinozaki looks like she's about to cry when she turns toward us.
And I know exactly why.
all
％Ｂ
「Wha...?」
I'm doubting my eyes.
The dome that we were all just celebrating over―
Had partially collapsed in the scant few minutes we had been away.
％Ｂ
「...You're... kidding...」
Sora
「...」
I drop the bottles in my arms as I run over to the others.

％Ｂ
「...What happened?」
We're all dumbstruck before the collapsed dome.
Touko
「...I don't know... This suddenly happened a little bit after you two went downstairs...」

Misa
「...Part of the cardboard suddenly crumpled. I do not know why. No one touched the dome there, and it really was very sudden... And then it immediately became imbalanced and...」


It suddenly crumpled...?
all
Rikka
「...It might have been because I cut one of the parts out badly...」
Misa
「Rikka-san...?」
Rikka
「Because... that has to be why... It was standing properly, and then it suddenly collapsed... It's because I was doing something I wasn't used to doing, and...」



Touko
「...It isn't your fault, Piano-chan...」
Rikka
「But there's no other reason for it to collapse...」
Touko
「...I was doing things I wasn't used to too. It might be because I didn't put some of the parts together properly...」

all
Marika
「...It might be because of one of the pieces of cardboard I collected...」
Misa
「I may have been too liberal in selecting usable cardboard after it got wet... I may have selected pieces that had weakened... I should have been more conservative...」


all
Natsuki
「If only I didn't say we should all go inside... Maybe it got messed up when we all went inside...」

Everyone's beating themselves up.
all
％Ｂ
「...」
I walk up to the dome to see why it collapsed.
I find the spot that's bent most, and trace the fold with my finger.

％Ｂ
「...It's not anyone's fault.」
％Ｂ
「The parts at the base are all bent in the same direction. I think this happened because the cardboard couldn't support its own weight.」

Touko
「...Can you fix it?」
I shake my head.
％Ｂ
「I can't fix this. Now that the cardboard's folded once, it's weakened, and there's the possibility it'll collapse under its own weight again if we rebuild it the same way.」


Natsuki
「But doesn't that mean there's also the possibility it won't do that?」

％Ｂ
「It might collapse while there are people inside.」
Natsuki
「Oh... Yeah, you're right...」
all
Rikka
「Either way, we don't have any more cardboard.」
Misa
「There are only five days until the Tanabata Festival...」
all
Touko
「And even if we did have cardboard, we can't just make another dome that might collapse...」

all
Despair settles over the group.
Sora
「...I'm... sorry...」
％Ｂ
「...Sora?」
Sora
「...It's... my fault... I said there were no issues... I was the one who... designed... the dome... It's my fault...」

Misa
「That is not true. I also heartily agreed that there would be no issues. So it would not be your fault alone...」


Sora interrupts Okihara-senpai by shaking her head hard.
Sora
「I wasted... all of your hard work... I'm... sorry... I'm sorry...」

all
Sora's shoulders quake as tears fall from her eyes.

I pull her to my chest to hide her tears and pat her head.

But that just makes Sora shake and cry even harder.

Her plaintive cries echo across the quiet of the rooftop.
We're all looking downward at the ground, biting our lips.
I look at Sora in my arms, look up at the sky, and take a deep breath.
％Ｂ
「...I'll do something about it.」
Sora
「...Hgh... 
Ryou
Wha
...?」
％Ｂ
「Could you let me handle the dome design?」
％Ｂ
「The way you showed us how to build the dome wasn't wrong. It was a simple design that made it easy for a group of amateurs like us to build.」


％Ｂ
「But I think the issue was that cardboard wasn't the right material for a dome that big.」

％Ｂ
「So I'm gonna think of a way to strengthen the design. I'll be honest. I've never designed anything dome-shaped... but I can think of it as a spherical home. That's architecture. It's my wheelhouse.」


％Ｂ
「So... I want you guys to collect more cardboard somehow.」
all
Marika
「But... it's too late to...」
％Ｂ
「There's still usable pieces from the dome that collapsed, and I'm gonna try to think of a design that takes advantage of what we've already got.」


Misa
「Will that be possible?」
％Ｂ
「...To be honest... I can't say for sure. But I don't want to give up.」

％Ｂ
「We've all gotten this far together. I know that it's just me being selfish, but I don't want to give up until the very end!」

％Ｂ
「There's still time. Five whole days. We finished this dome in four days once we started construction. We should be able to make it in time if we have enough cardboard.」


all
Touko
「...That's true. I think it might not be impossible, from that perspective.」
all
％Ｂ
「I want you guys to help one more time!」
They all give a strong nod in reply.
No one's depressed anymore.
all
We're all filled with the determination to give it another try.
all
Sora
「...I don't want... you to force yourselves.」
Except for one person―
Sora
「...You guys.. don't have... to force yourself for me... If it won't work, then I'll give up... So...」

I place my hand on her head before she can finish.
％Ｂ
「...I told you before, didn't I? I wanna make precious memories with you of our time at school.」


Sora
「...*nod*」
Marika
「We feel the same way. We want to make memories together with you, Ousaka-san.」

Misa
「The first dome may have failed, but that has led to us now having memories of wanting to try once more.」

Natsuki
「It's the same as photos. The more memories you have, the better.」
Rikka
「I've never done anything like this before, but it ended up being fun.」

Touko
「I won't have anything to do until the Tanabata Festival if we give up now. This'll be a perfect way of killing time.」

％Ｂ
「We can make memories like this thanks to you, Sora. So... Well, if we're gonna say it Sora-style─」


all
Marika & Natsuki & Misa & Rikka & Touko
「No issues.」
Sora
「...You guys... Thank... you... Thank you...」
She bows her head low.
all
％Ｂ
「So anyway, you better keep practicing your talk too. Ritsu-sensei's gonna give you a stern talking-to if you give a shaky talk after we finish the dome.」


Rikka
「Wait a second, don't bring me into this.」
Everyone smiles at my joke.
all
...We can do this.
We'll definitely make another, stronger dome...!
We put away the collapsed dome. The others split off to go find new cardboard, and I head to the Azuma Architectural Firm.

Azuma
「...Tips for designing dome-shaped buildings?」
％Ｂ
「Yes.」
I told Azuma-san about everything that's happened, and asked him for pointers on how to reinforce a building.

Azuma
「I bet you made some cool speech or something about how you'd do something about that, didn't you? In front of that cute girlfriend of yours.」

％Ｂ
「...Yes, I did.」
Azuma
「And then you immediately come to me for pointers?」
％Ｂ
「...I know it's lame. But if acting cool's going to lead to me messing up, then I don't mind how lame I get... What I need now is certainty. That's why...」


Azuma
「Then think it over by yourself for at least one day. Come back here again if you still don't know what to do.」

％Ｂ
「But we don't have much time―」
Azuma
「If you want to become an architect, then you shouldn't be so quick to beg others for answers. This job isn't for people who can't think on their own.」

％Ｂ
「Ngh...」
He's right.
I have nothing to say in response.
％Ｂ
「...I understand. I'll try thinking on my own.」
Azuma
「Yeah, do that. There's no end to spherical objects in the world. Start by thinking about those.」


％Ｂ
「...Yes. Oh, I know. One more thing...」

Azuma
「What, there's more?」
％Ｂ
「Do you have any cardboard?」
Azuma
「...We're an architectural firm, you know.」
％Ｂ
「I just thought it wouldn't hurt to ask.」
Azuma
「At least you're on top of stuff like that, I guess... but unfortunately, we don't have any cardboard.」

Azuma
「I'll ask around for you. But don't expect anything, all right?」

％Ｂ
「Thank you very much. I'll be here again tomorrow, then. With a solution.」

Azuma
「Yeah. I'm expecting good things.」
all
％Ｂ
「It's just like he says...」
If I want to be an architect, I shouldn't give up and ask others for answers so easily. I need to try thinking of a solution myself first!

％Ｂ
「All right... Let's start with doing some research on dome-shaped buildings.」
I turn on my computer and start looking into dome architecture through the ages and throughout the world.

％Ｂ
「Sigh... No good... I can't think of any good ideas...」
I tried looking into lots of different kinds of dome constructions.
Buildings reinforced with arches, dome-shaped stadiums, stonework ovens, igloos, so on and so forth...

But I couldn't find anything in any of the things I looked into that seemed useful for our dome.

％Ｂ
「Especially since we're using cardboard...」
We can't use support pillars because we have to make sure the interior's a hemisphere.

So we'll need to improve the structure of the walls for the dome to be able to support its own weight.
Sora was on the right track with her design.

Maybe we could partition the 36 ring components further into 72?
But increasing the number of part connections might end up making it more fragile instead of stronger.

％Ｂ
「We can't change our material at this point, and our budget's also...」
There's no other choice but cardboard for our building material.
％Ｂ
「Sigh... This is tough.」
Azuma-san said there was no shortage of spherical objects out there...

％Ｂ
「...Hm.」
I just happen to spot one such object by my bedside.
It's the soccer ball I received for autographs back when I was in the soccer team.
％Ｂ
「...Another spherical object.」
％Ｂ
「...」
％Ｂ
「...Hm?」
I think back over Azuma-san's words.
He said "spherical objects" back then.
Not spherical buildings.
I grab the soccer ball.
Soccer balls are made up of a combination of pentagons and hexagons.
They all interlock diagonally with one another to disperse force evenly across the surface.
％Ｂ
「...I think we can use this.」
A dome design taking advantage of interlocking polygons...
％Ｂ
「...I think this might be it!」
I turn back toward my computer and start on a blueprint.
