The city's been adorned with vivid Tanabata decorations.
There are big stalks of bamboo tied onto the telephone poles and streetlights with multitudes of colorful decorations hanging down from them.

％Ｂ
「Oh yeah, I kinda remember these decorations.」
Natsuki
「So you do remember that much, at least?」
％Ｂ
「Mmm... Yeah, but I think that's about all. I'm pretty sure I must've come with my parents, though.」

Natsuki
「We'll need to make sure you burn this sight into your eyes today then, so you don't forget this time.」

％Ｂ
「Of course I'm not gonna forget. I'm gonna come here with you every year from now on.」

Natsuki
「Huh?」
％Ｂ
「Hm? Or not?」
Natsuki
「No, we are! We'll come every year! August 8th is reserved forever!」

％Ｂ
「I understand. Thank you very much for your reservation, Segawa Natsuki-sama. Apologies, but reservations cannot be canceled. Ever.」


Natsuki
「Ahahaha!」
％Ｂ
「Hahaha!」
all
We start walking around the festival.
Natsuki takes photos of the tanzaku and of the marketplace mascot characters being attacked by children.


She takes photos of little kids dressed up in their yukatas, and offers to send their parents the data to their phones.

Nothing brings me more happiness and enjoyment than seeing that smile on her face the whole way through.

Natsuki
「Oooh man, I got lots! Lots and lots of photos!」
％Ｂ
「About how many?」
Natsuki
「Around four hundred, I think? That's the nice thing about digital cameras.」

Natsuki
「Before, you'd need at least ten rolls of film to take four hundred photos. Though I guess that was why every shot counted back then.」


％Ｂ
「Wanna get something to eat? You're starting to get hungry, right?」
Natsuki
「That's true. Okay then... Let's settle things.」

％Ｂ
「Huh? Settle things?」
Natsuki
「Did you forget? We said we'd compete in goldfish scooping, and whoever loses pays for all the food today.」

％Ｂ
「Oh yeah... And the loser has to say either Imagawa rolls or rotation rolls, whatever the other person says. Oh, and calling baby castellas dick rolls.」


Natsuki
「Gh... I can't afford to lose...」
％Ｂ
「Oh, there's a stall for goldfish scooping.」
Natsuki
「Let's do this now, then.」
％Ｂ
「Just so you know, I'm not the kinda guy who's gonna go easy on you just 'cause you're my girlfriend.」

Natsuki
「Hmhmmmh, are you sure you wanna say that now instead of using it as an excuse when you lose～? I'm pretty crazy when it comes to goldfish scooping, you know.」


％Ｂ
「Okay. Then let's―」
Natsuki
「Have a good, clean match!」
Ryousuke・Natsuki
％Ｂ
「Mister, one scoop each!」
Natsuki
「Mister, one scoop each!」
％Ｂ・Natsuki
％Ｂ
「Mister, one scoop each!」
Natsuki
「Mister, one scoop each!」
Get serious!
Go easy on her.
all
％Ｂ
「I never thought... it'd end this way...」
Natsuki
「Yeah. I definitely didn't expect this...」
％Ｂ
「I can't believe neither of us got even a single one...」
Natsuki
「That was... a little too pathetic...」
How are we so garbage at this...?
Natsuki
「So what are we doing about the competition?」
％Ｂ
「What do you mean... Neither of us won at goldfish scooping, so we'll just have to settle things another way.」

Natsuki
「We're going to keep going? Okay. You're on!」
％Ｂ
「How about that next, then?」
Natsuki
「Ring toss. Sure thing. Ring toss is the only thing I've ever been good at, ever since I was a kid.」

％Ｂ
「I thought you said that about goldfish scooping...?」
Natsuki
「Don't worry about the details! Hey mister, enough for two please!」

Get serious!
Go easy on her.
all
％Ｂ
「I mean, come on... If you're not good at it, then just say so...」
Natsuki
「It's not like you got any either...」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, but I never said I was any good at it.」
Natsuki
「So then what are you good at?」
％Ｂ
「Well, the man's festival game is obviously the shooting gallery.」
Natsuki
「Oh yeah, the shooting gallery. Wanna compete with that, then?」
％Ｂ
「I think the odds are too stacked against you for this one.」
Natsuki
「We won't know until we try.」
％Ｂ
「Want a handicap? I could do it with my eyes closed or something.」
Natsuki
「Khh, you're making fun of me! I don't need any handicap! I'm gonna beat you fair and square!」

％Ｂ
「I'd like to see you try! Mister, enough for two!」

Get serious!
Go easy on her!
all
Natsuki
「Pfffhhhh! What do you mean you're good at the shooting gallery!? I can't believe you said that! You didn't even land a single shot!」

％Ｂ
「Uuuh... It wasn't supposed to end this way...」
Natsuki
「Man, you offered a handicap and everything. So uncool.」
％Ｂ
「...Sorry to interrupt you in the middle of your gloating, but it's a tie 'cause you didn't land any shots either...」

Natsuki
「I-I know that... It's not like I was thinking I'd win at the shooting gallery in the first place...」

％Ｂ
「Looks like we'll really have to settle things for sure now...」
Natsuki
「You're right... We can't go back at this point...」
％Ｂ
「Then!」
Natsuki
「Yeah!」
Ryousuke・Natsuki
％Ｂ
「We'll settle it with darts! Mister, enough darts for two!」
Natsuki
「We'll settle it with darts! Mister, enough darts for two!」
％Ｂ・Natsuki

「We'll settle it with darts! Mister, enough darts for two!」

Street Vendor
「Welcome!」
％Ｂ
「...」
Street Vendor
「What's wrong, buddy? Not here to buy anything?」
％Ｂ
「Uuh...」
Natsuki
「Come on... Hurry up and say it...!」
％Ｂ
「One... One dick roll, please!」
Street Vendor
「...Sorry, buddy, but we've only got baby castellas here...」
Natsuki
「Ahahahahahah!」
all
％Ｂ
「Dammit... You made me go make a fool out of myself.」
Natsuki
「What are you even talking about? You're the one trying to get your girlfriend to do that exact embarrassing thing.」


％Ｂ
「It was just a joke... I wasn't actually gonna make you say it if you lost...」

Natsuki
「A likely story. It is my freak of a boyfriend we're talking about.」
％Ｂ
「Tch... Guess you just don't trust me.」
Natsuki
「We can just have you give me the money for the stuff we competed on up until now later. First, I think I want you to buy one of those.」

％Ｂ
「One of those?」
Natsuki
「You know what I'm talking about. A ro・ta・tion・roll.」
％Ｂ
「...Imagawa roll.」
Natsuki
「Nooo, that's not what you call iiit. You lost, didn't yooou?」
％Ｂ
「Rotation roll...」
Natsuki
「Mhm, very good.」
％Ｂ
「Dammit! I'm gonna get you back at next year's Tanabata Festival!」
Natsuki
「I like sound of that. We can put our pride on the line every year.」
％Ｂ
「I hope you live out this next year in fear.」
Natsuki
「Yeah, yeah. Anyway, you're paying for food this year. Oh, and I want a candied apple, a chocolate banana, and okonomiyaki too.」

％Ｂ
「Your title of diet warrior's going to shame.」
Natsuki
「I'm off as a diet warrior today. My battles as a diet warrior begin anew tomorrow. So anyway, yeah, thank yooouu♪」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, yeah...」
Natsuki
「...」
Street Vendor
「Welcome!」
Natsuki
「...」
Street Vendor
「What's wrong, missy? Not here to buy anything?」
Natsuki
「Uuh...」
％Ｂ
「I'll let this slide if you just apologize, you know.」
Natsuki
「One... One dick roll, please!」
Street Vendor
「...Sorry, missy, but we've only got baby castellas here...」
Natsuki
「Waaaaaahhh!」
all
％Ｂ
「Didn't think you'd actually say it...」
Natsuki
「Why are you only saying that now!? You big dumb idiot! You freak! You perv! Waaaahhh!」

％Ｂ
「I tried to stop you, didn't I? But you just kept going on about how it's a competition and didn't listen.」

Natsuki
「Uuuhh... I can't go back on my word, because that's how the competition turned out...」
％Ｂ
「You're really hard on yourself about that, huh...」
Natsuki
「Sigh... Let's go for a change of pace... Ryousuke, I'm gonna buy some rotation rolls. Want any?」
Natsuki
「Sigh... Let's go for a change of pace... I'm gonna buy some rotation rolls. Want any?」
％Ｂ
「Rotation rolls?」
Natsuki
「...I...Imagawa rolls... Want one...?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, I'll have one.」
Natsuki
「Mukiiiiihhh! I'm so angry! I'm gonna get you back for this next year, you hear!?」

％Ｂ
「Oh, I like the sound of that. We'll compete between Imagawa or rotation rolls every year.」
Natsuki
「I'm gonna train all year long!」
％Ｂ
「Fu, fu, fu. I will accept your challenge, as king.」
We head to a certain spot once we've had our fill of the festival.
There's an array of white boards lined up so they're visible to everyone in the pedestrian mall.

This is where the submissions to the "Tanabata Photography Contest" put on by the city of Shionagi are being displayed.\n\r

It's our final goal for the night.
％Ｂ
「Okay, we're here.」
Natsuki
「Phew... We're finally here...」
All of the submissions are posted up on the boards.
The photo in the center of each of the boards is separated from all the others, with a golden flower ornament placed beside it.

％Ｂ
「Do the flowers mean they're prize winners?」
Natsuki
「Probably.」
all
I can't see the submissions themselves too well from where we're standing.
％Ｂ
「Let's go look.」
Natsuki
「O...Okay...」
％Ｂ
「What's up?」
Natsuki
「I'm kinda nervous... I've never made a submission to one of these before, so I don't know how I should react if I don't end up winning a prize or anything.」


％Ｂ
「M-Mm～... I don't really know what to say to that... but don't you think you'll just get even better at photography if that happens?」


％Ｂ
「You can look at the submissions that won prizes, see their techniques and stuff, and apply that the next time.」

Natsuki
「You're... really positive, you know that?」
％Ｂ
「Well yeah, I've got my own goal of becoming an architect. I've had my shortcomings thrust right in front of me before. You can't get down every time it happens, or else you won't be able to move forward.」


Natsuki
「Right... You're right. I'm still challenging myself with this stuff, aren't I?」

％Ｂ
「Exactly. Let's go then, expert cameraman of tomorrow.」
Natsuki
「Okay!」
all
We push our way through the crowd of people in front of the photos and walk up to the biggest, most impressive-looking photo.

Natsuki's stride shortens with every step forward.
So I hold her hand.
Her hand's tensed up, but she softens and unclenches her fist when I make contact, and immediately squeezes back.


We stop in front of the display panel, and─
％Ｂ
「...」
Natsuki
「...」
We look at the photo surrounded by flower ornaments in the center.
It's a photo of children having fun preparing for the city's Tanabata Festival.

This isn't Natsuki's photo, as far as I know.
Which means... unfortunately, Natsuki's submission is─
Natsuki
「...It's here.」
％Ｂ
「Wha!?」
I look at her.
She's staring disbelievingly at the photo displayed to the bottom left of the grand prize winner.

She slowly points.
I look.
_ef_ryusen03
_ef_ryusen04
It's a photo of a starry night sky.
Judges' Special Award: "A Bridge of Prayers."
％Ｂ
「Whoaaaahhh!? Seriously!?」
Natsuki
「No way...」
I grab Natsuki by the shoulders as she stands there in a daze, and shake her.
％Ｂ
「Hey, you see that!? You got the judges' special award!」
Natsuki
「Ye...Yeah... I see it...」
％Ｂ
「That's amazing! It might not be the grand prize, but it's still amazing!」
I'm way more excited about this than Natsuki is.
The people around us realize that one of the prize winners must've arrived, and they start clapping.

Passerby A
「That your photo, miss? Congratulations!」
Natsuki
「Wha, uh, um...」
Passerby B
「Congratulations. Getting the judges' special award is amazing.」
Natsuki
「O-Oh, yes... Th-Thank you very much...」
Natsuki flushes with embarrassment in response to the sudden congratulations.
Her hand gripping mine is hot... and it's trembling.
all
_ef_ryusen03
_ef_ryusen04
I take a good look at Natsuki's photo.
It's a beautiful photo of a starry sky, enough to make you catch your breath.\n\r
Hikoboshi, or Altair, and Orihime, or Vega, with the Milky Way between them.
But the thing that stands out most is a single streak of light.\n \n\r
There's a shooting star cutting across the Milky Way, forming a bridge to make way for the lovers' once-in-a-year rendezvous.

It's as if it were planned for the two of them by the gods...
I get it now... So this is what the "bridge" in the title refers to.
％Ｂ
「I'm surprised you managed to get a shooting star like that...」
Natsuki
「It was complete coincidence... but it was exactly the coincidence I was aiming for.」
％Ｂ
「Really?」
Natsuki
「It's because of what you said
, Ryousuke

. You said the Perseid meteor shower comes close this time of year, so you see lots of shooting stars.」


Natsuki
「So I thought I could get lucky and have one cut right across the Milky Way.」

％Ｂ
「And one did, at the best timing, in the best position...」

There's a description next to each submission saying why it won an award.
The one next to Natsuki's says that the shooting star connecting two lovers together is a fitting photo for decorating the Tanabata Festival.

％Ｂ
「A Bridge of Prayers... but what's the prayer part mean?」

Natsuki
「Oh, it's―」
all
A little boy suddenly appears between us.
He claps his hands together at Natsuki's photo.
Boy C
「I wish for more allowance, I wish for more allowance, I wish for more allowance!」

He repeats a wish three times, smiles happily, and leaves.
Natsuki
「―That's what it means.」
％Ｂ
「I get it... Yeah, you can say your wish three times this way.」

Natsuki
「Right?」
％Ｂ
「Well then, I think I'll take the opportunity to make a wish too.」
Natsuki
「Oh, me too, then.」
％Ｂ
「It's your own photo, though.」
Natsuki
「Yeah, but... C'mon, who cares?」
all
We put our hands together in front of the photo and close our eyes.
Natsuki
「I wish to always... always, always be together with Ryousuke!」
Natsuki
「I wish to always... always, always be together with you!」
％Ｂ
「I... will always, always be together with Natsuki!」
Natsuki
「...I don't think that was a wish just now.」
％Ｂ
「Hm? You think so? Good for you, though. Your wish came true.」

Natsuki
「Already!?」
％Ｂ
「That photo works wonders!」
Natsuki
「Sure, we can go with that. Ahaha!」
％Ｂ
「And it looks like you're making that other dream of taking photos to make people smile come true too.」

That boy who made the wish earlier was smiling, and so are the other people around us who are looking at Natsuki's photo.

Natsuki
「Ehehe... It's aaall thanks to you, Ryousuke.」
Natsuki
「Ehehe... It's aaall thanks to you.」
％Ｂ
「That's not true. This was all you.」
Natsuki
「No, it's thanks to you.」
She makes a rectangle out of her thumbs and index fingers and turns toward me.\n\r

As if she were taking a photo of me.
Natsuki
「You showed me lots of things.」
Natsuki
「You showed me joy, fun, happiness, wonder, things that I can work hard at, warmth... and the fact that I could love someone this much. You showed me lots and lots of different things.」


Natsuki
「I wouldn't have noticed any of those things on my own. It's all because you were there by my side.」

Natsuki
「Photos might be able to turn an instant into an eternity, but love can carve an eternity into your heart.」

She winks, as if to click the shutter.
As if to preserve the present inside her heart.
Natsuki
「I'll always, always love you.」
