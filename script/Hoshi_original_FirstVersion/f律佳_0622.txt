Touko
「Hey, look! Look at aaall the stars!」
Sora
「...They're not stars. They're too alive...」
Touko
「Whaaat... You think so? I think they're colorful and cute. We could make constellations with this many of these.」

Sora
「...Living constellations... I could see it.」
Ousaka gives Yukimura a thumbs-up, and Yukimura proudly returns the gesture.

A few of the starfish in Yukimura's hands plop back into the tide pool.

The two of them, having reached a mutual understanding, immediately get to work on putting together a star(fish) map.

Marika
「Ahaha, Ousaka-san and Yukimura-san look like they're having a lot of fun.」
％Ｂ
「I dunno about that mountain of starfish they've got, though...」
Marika
「Ahaha... Yeah...」
They're not gonna try to take all of those back with us, are they?
all
％Ｂ
「Hey! We're not here to play, so get over here and help us, all right?」

Touko
「Ahaha, we know! Starfish, starfish!」
Sora
「...The curtain rises on an oceanic star show.」
％Ｂ
「...Do they really get it?」
We're here to catch fish again today.
％Ｂ
「I'm sorry about this, Okihara-senpai...」
Misa
「It's fine. I'm very happy to see Sora-san and Touko-san enjoying the ocean so much!」

Misa
「But it is a shame that we are missing Rikka-san today...」
％Ｂ
「She's probably practicing "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star" at home right now.」
Misa
「...So it is because she is complying with our selfish request. I feel quite guilty.」

％Ｂ
「It may just be me, but I think Narusawa would tell you that you don't need to pay it any mind.」

％Ｂ
「Narusawa's doing work that only she can do, so let's do our share of the work too.」

Misa
「Yes! You're very right! Let's work hard and collect!」
％Ｂ
「By the way, how close are we to having all of the animals you wished to have?」

Misa
「We only need a few more, thanks to everyone's efforts.」

％Ｂ
「Is that so. Let's do our best and get the rest, then... Oh, before that, just one moment please.」

Misa
「Is something the matter?」
％Ｂ
「I'm going to update Narusawa on the current situation.」
Misa
「I think that sounds very wonderful!」
all
I step away from Okihara-senpai a bit to send Narusawa a LIME message.

【％Ｂ】「We're almost at our #Ngoal for collecting!」
【Rikka】「Congratulations. I'm #Nplaying the piano right #Nnow.」
【％Ｂ】「Looking forward to #Nhearing it. Okihara-#Nsenpai and Ousaka are #Ntoo.」
【Rikka】「Thank you.」
【％Ｂ】「Though Ousaka and #NYukimura are just #Nplaying with starfish #Nright now.」
【Rikka】「Starfish?」
【％Ｂ】「They're apparently #Nmaking constellations #Nout of starfish.」
【Rikka】「Sounds like Ousaka-san.」
【％Ｂ】「I wish I could be that #Nfull of energy in this #Nheat. I'm sweating from #Njust standing here.」
【Rikka】「Is it really that hot? #NAre you okay?」
【％Ｂ】「I'm fine. I'm hydrating #Nmyself pretty often.」
【Rikka】「Take breaks often too.」
【％Ｂ】「Got it. Thanks. That's #Nprobably enough from #Nme, don't wanna get in #Nthe way of your #Npractice. Good luck.」
【Rikka】「Yes. Good luck to you #Ntoo.」

Natsuki
「So happy you can't stop grinning?」
％Ｂ
「Whaeh!? O-Oh, it's just you, Segawa... Wait a second! Don't look at other people's phones!」

Natsuki
「Okay, okay.」
She backs off, waving her hands in the air like an actor in a comedy.

％Ｂ
「You're awfully quick to back off today.」
Natsuki
「Well I can pretty much guess who you were talking to and what the conversation was like.」
Natsuki
「More importantly, look at this! Tadaaah! A paaanoooraaamaaa!」

％Ｂ
「A panorama?」
Natsuki
「I gave it a try for fun. We can use one to give people a feel for the ocean this way, right?」

％Ｂ
「Let's see... The heck is this?」
Natsuki
「Ahaha. I messed up 'cause I'm not used to doing these.」
％Ｂ
「...You said you messed up taking this, right?」
Natsuki
「That's what I said, didn't I? Or what, is there something you wanna talk about～?」

all
％Ｂ
「Hmm...」
...The panorama's distorted in a way that makes my expression look unusually perverted.
