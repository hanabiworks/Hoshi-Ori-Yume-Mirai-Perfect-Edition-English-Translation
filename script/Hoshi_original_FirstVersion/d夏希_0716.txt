「Yooo.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
Natsuki
「Hey there, Soraaa.」

Touko
「Welcome, you two.」
Natsuki
「Oh, Touko. You're here too?」
Sora
「...Tou's been coming to help a lot lately.」
Touko
「It's just because you're so much fun, Fluffyhead. I never get bored of watching you.」

％Ｂ
「Is she some kinda rare animal to you?」
Touko
「Oh no, I'm helping her out too. We're making the panel for explaining stuff together right now.」

％Ｂ
「You mean like one for the stories about Sagittarius and Pisces that you told me about before? Those were super cool.」

Natsuki
「What stories? I wanna hear them too.」
％Ｂ
「They're like the origins of the constellations. It's kinda like getting the inside story to them. They're really fun to listen to.」

Sora
「...We're making the mythology panel right now. I collected some stories, mostly from Greek mythology. The stars are deeply connected with the gods, so I think it'll get people interested.」


％Ｂ
「Is this what you're talking about? Can I read it?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
Natsuki
「I wanna read it too! Let me read it with you.」
all
％Ｂ
「Let's see...」
"─The goddess Aphrodite."
Natsuki
「Oh, I know that name. She's the really pretty goddess who was born from foam, right?」

"Aphrodite was one of the twelve Olympian gods, and was known as the goddess of love, beauty, and sexuality."

％Ｂ
「...Love, beauty, and... sexuality?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
"Aphrodite was also known as the goddess of passion, and she gave birth to many children from different fathers even after she married Hephaestus, god of the forge. She loved having sex."


％Ｂ
「Wha...」
"Though Aphrodite is known as having been born from foam, this foam was actually created when the titan Cronus killed his father Uranus and threw his genitals into the sea. The foam came forth from these genitals."
"And so, Aphrodite's father is a penis."
Natsuki
「...Oooh...」
％Ｂ
「...This is way too direct...」
"Hephaestus became angry with his wife's rampant affairs, and fashioned a special net and hid it in their bed. After Hephaestus left for his work, Aphrodite naturally invited the war god Ares to her home."


"As soon as the two of them began having sex on her bed, Hephaestus' net trapped them both. Having caught the adulterers in the act, Hephaestus showed them to the messenger god Hermes, who had just happened to come by."
％Ｂ
「...Why?」
Natsuki
「Maybe... he likes that kinda stuff?」
％Ｂ
「What kinda freak gets turned on from letting someone see his wife having sex with another guy...?」

"Hermes ran all through Mount Olympus in the blink of an eye to spread the news, and brought the twelve gods of Olympus to Hephaestus' home."

％Ｂ
「What the hell, Hermes!?」
Natsuki
「He is the messenger god, after all...」
"And so, all twelve gods learned of Aphrodite's immoral sex with Ares."

％Ｂ
「...Wow.」
Natsuki
「Does this mean... the other gods saw them... connected... Um... Like, still doing it...?」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, probably.」
Natsuki
「...That's kinda intense...」

Touko
「Camera-chan... You're not interested in stuff like that too, are you?」
Natsuki
「N-No, I'm not... I was just imagining it, and it seemed like it'd be intense...」

You've gotta be kidding me...
She wasn't imagining herself in the same situation, was she?
Please, just no...
all
"The blind prophet Tiresias."
％Ｂ
「I don't know this name... but "blind prophet" sounds kinda cool.」

Sora
「...Middle schooler.」
Touko
「Oh, but that's a fun story. I'd recommend it.」
％Ｂ
「Let's see here...」
"One day, Tiresias came upon a snake having sex in the mountains, and hit it with a stick to stop it."

％Ｂ
「Awful right from the start...」
"Tiresias' body then changed from a man's to a woman's. After that, Tiresias lived as a woman, and experienced having sex with men."


Natsuki
「Uh...」
"Several years later, Tiresias came upon a snake having sex once more, and hit it with a stick again."

％Ｂ
「What's this guy got against snakes...?」
"Tiresias' body then went back to being a man's."

Natsuki
「That's great for him... I think?」
"One day, Zeus and his wife Hera were discussing the differences between a man and woman when having sex. Zeus claimed that the woman felt more pleasure during sex, while Hera argued that the man did."


"The two of them sought out Tiresias' opinion. Tiresias said, 'A woman feels ten times more pleasure than a man. I know, because I've experienced it myself!'"


"And so Hera blinded Tiresias in her anger. Zeus then gave him the power of prophecy out of pity. Such is the origin of the blind prophet Tiresias."


％Ｂ
「...The blind prophet doesn't seem that cool anymore...」
Touko
「See? Pretty fun story, right?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, it was fun to read... but don't you think these stories are phrased a little too bluntly? With the sex and the penises... There's going to be families with kids at the festival, so maybe you should try rephrasing things...」


Sora
「...I assumed children wouldn't understand words like "intercourse" or "male genitals."」

％Ｂ
「It might be better to just not tell them at all...」
Touko
「Mmm... I feel like the adults would love it, though. You really don't think it's okay?」
％Ｂ
「If I'm gonna be honest, I think you should go with some milder stories. I feel like the student council or event committee might veto them before they even get to the festival at this rate.」


％Ｂ
「Or even worse, we might get complaints from visitors at the festival. Getting complaints about a festival display might end up being a huge issue for the school.」


Touko
「Yeah, that'd be bad... I guess we'll have to change it after all?」

Sora
「...Shame.」
all
％Ｂ
「What do you think, Natsuki?」
Natsuki
「...」
Touko
「Oh dear... She's kinda out of it.」
Sora
「...Her face is bright red.」
Dammit, she's not imagining herself in the same situation again, is she...?
％Ｂ
「Heeey, Natsukiii? Natsuki-saaan?」
Natsuki
「Haeh? Huh? Wh-What?」
％Ｂ
「What do you think? About Ousaka's stuff.」
Natsuki
「I...I think it feels better for the woman...?」
Touko
「...」
Sora
「...」
...I knew it.
Natsuki
「H-Huh? No? Wait... did I do it again...?」
％Ｂ
「Well... It's fine, I guess...」
