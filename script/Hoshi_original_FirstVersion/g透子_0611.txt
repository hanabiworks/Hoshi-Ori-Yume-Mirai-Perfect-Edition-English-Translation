I go to class E after school.
But I don't see Yukimura anywhere.
％Ｂ
「Hey. Can I ask you something?」
Female Student C
「Yes?」
％Ｂ
「There's a Yukimura in this class, right? You know where she is?」

Female Student C
「Yukimura-san? I haven't seen her... Maybe she isn't back yet?」

％Ｂ
「Back from where?」
Female Student C
「We just had gym. Though I didn't see her in the changing room either... Maybe she went home already.」

％Ｂ
「Does that happen a lot?」
Female Student C
「Every now and then. It's easy to tell when she's gone because she stands out, but she just disappears like that.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, Yukimura does stand out, doesn't she?」
Female Student C
「Are you friends with her?」
％Ｂ
「...No idea. I talk to her now and then.」
Female Student C
「Wow, that's amazing! She almost never talks in class. She seems kinda hard to talk to, don't you think?」

％Ｂ
「She's actually pretty fun once you get to know her.」
Female Student C
「We all tried to talk to her at first. But how do you get to know someone when they pretty much always end conversations after a few words?」


...I don't think she's that cold.
I'm a little surprised at how differently Yukimura's class sees her compared to what I think of her.

Female Student C
「You're a transfer student too, aren't you? Maybe it's because you two have that as a connection.」

％Ｂ
「Haha, maybe. Thanks. You've been a big help.」
I thank her and leave.
I start heading to where I first met Yukimura―the old school building.
％Ｂ
「Yukimura, I came to talk aga...in, so...?」
Touko
「...Wha!?」
She must not have been expecting me.
Yukimura freezes up as I walk in. It looks like she was changing.

I also freeze up.
I take a few seconds to confirm that this is really happening, and then reflexively turn the other way.

％Ｂ
「M-My bad! I didn't think you'd be changing! I didn't mean to peek!」

The words I had ready in my head are nowhere to be found.
Yukimura's normally covered skin is quite the stimulus. It's eating away my thoughts.

％Ｂ
（Th-They're as big as ever...!）
Touko
「...Did you see?」
％Ｂ
「Well, uh... A-Ahahaha...」
Touko
「...Pervert.」
Gh...!
The sounds of rustling fabric I can hear from behind my back are only stirring my imagination!
It may have been by accident, but I still saw her.
It's going to be awkward, but I should apologize and...
Touko
「Hgh!? Not good, come here!」
％Ｂ
「Huh? Whoa!?」
％Ｂ
「Wh-What the heck!? What are you...!?」
Touko
「Shh! Quiet! Or they'll find us!」
％Ｂ
「Wha...? Find us...?」
I strain my ears. I can hear footsteps from far away.
％Ｂ
「...Is someone here? Who else comes here other than us...?」

Touko
「I don't know... but we need to hide for now.」
％Ｂ
「U-Um... Yukimura...? Y-Your skirt...!」
Touko
「I-I know that! There's nothing I can do about it, we need to hide! This is all because you suddenly showed up and...!」

％Ｂ
「Gh! The footsteps are pretty close...!」
I can feel Yukimura's warmth and softness.
Her breathing just scant centimeters before me, and her vaguely sweet fragrance.
％Ｂ
「Hgh...!」
My heart rate spikes. Sweat beads on my skin.
How the hell could I not be conscious of all this...!?
Touko
「That spot's dangerous...! You'll make a sound if you touch there. Come over here more...!」

％Ｂ
「No, but I can't...!」
Touko
「There's nothing we can do about this, is there...!? I won't get angry as long as you don't grope me or anything! Just stick closer to me...!」


I can feel the blood pumping through me from the nervousness and arousal.
My heart's rampaging in my chest. I feel like it might be audible from outside.

Teacher A
「Ohh, it's tidier than I thought. I think it might be fine to open it up this way.」

Teacher B
「You're right. Though we'll need to be thorough with the final safety checks.」

％Ｂ
（...Are those teachers talking? Open it up... What are they talking about?）
Teacher A
「The dismantling's started a bit already... We should probably talk to the contractors and ask about safety.」

Teacher B
「I'm glad it's before any actual construction work's begun. It would have been a more difficult decision otherwise.」

Teacher A
「That's true. We should be careful with checking over what spots are and aren't usable.」

The words from earlier―"open up"―have me curious.
What are they talking about?
There are a few more phrases that catch in my mind.
"Final safety checks," "decision," "usable spots"...
It doesn't look like the teachers are here because of us.
So then why?
The footsteps grow distant.
Looks like we've managed to make it through without being spotted.
％Ｂ
「M-Man, I was so nervous! We were this close to...」
Touko
「...Wait. I think there's more.」
％Ｂ
「Wha...!?」
Male Student A
「What do you think? May we have permission to use it?」
Female Student A
「We would really like to use this plan! And we need a large classroom for that!」

Teacher A
「We said it was just a cursory inspection for now. We won't be able to make any final decisions until we've investigated thoroughly.」

Touko
「H-Hey...! Don't move!」
％Ｂ
「M-My bad...! This position's pretty uncomfortable...!」
I'm trying the best I can to reduce how much we're touching each other, but I can't completely avoid contact.
I'm feeling Yukimura's warmth and smelling her for the first time.
It's messing with my thoughts and... getting me excited, despite the tense situation.
Touko
「...You're not, um... t-turned on, are you...?」
％Ｂ
「Gh!? Uh, well, um...!」
Touko
「You're dirtier than you look. I can't believe it... turned on in a situation like this.」

％Ｂ
「I-I can't help it! It's not like I'm doing this on purpose!」

Touko
「Aahn! I told you, don't move... aah...! Noo...!」
％Ｂ
「You've got some room on your side, don't you!? I'm stuck like this, so...!」

Touko
「...Do you want me to pull away?」
％Ｂ
「...Wha?」
Touko
「You're right, I do have a little bit of space, but... you want me to pull away from you...?」

％Ｂ
「Uh, well... Um, Yukimura...?」
Touko
「We're so close right now, you know... My heart's beating so fast... I think I might go crazy.」

My heart jumps in my chest.
I can see my own shocked expression reflected in Yukimura's big eyes.
Touko
「If you want me to... then I...」
％Ｂ
「W-Wait a second! This is crazy! Just calm down...」
Touko
「...Juuust kidding. Did I get your heart going?」
％Ｂ
「Gh...! Y-You're just so...!」
Touko
「Aahn, I said not to move. They're going to find us.」
％Ｂ
「It's 'cause you started saying weird stuff! You freaked me out!」

Touko
「Ahaha, sorry about that. I just felt like messing with you a bit.」

I feel like I've gone completely limp...
I wanna just get out of here and curl up in the fetal position...
Touko
「...Shh! I think they're getting closer again...!」
What the hell! Tense, then slack, then tense again!
I can't believe my willpower's being eroded this badly when all I'm doing is just sitting still!
Teacher A
「We'll take another look in the future. We'll probably have an answer for you by next week.」
Male Student A
「We understand. If there's anything we can do to help, please let us know. Thank you very much!」

％Ｂ
「...Looks like they're gone.」
Touko
「Seems like it... Sigh. We can finally get out...」
Touko
「...That was nerve-racking, wasn't it?」
％Ｂ
「Um, I'm... sorry about all that.」
Touko
「Huh? About what?」
％Ｂ
「About how I walked in on you changing, and uh... I touched you and stuff while we were hiding...」

Touko
「It wasn't on purpose, right? It's fine. But... there won't be a next time, okay?」

％Ｂ
「I-I know! I won't do it again! I'll be careful from now on!」
Touko
「But it was fun. Like playing hide and seek. Playing kids' games once you're older's kinda different, don't you think?」

％Ｂ
「...You're pretty bold, you know that?」
Touko
「Mmm... I think it's more like I'm curious? I just can't not want to do things that are interesting or exciting.」


I see. That makes sense.
I did feel like she was nervous just now, but also kinda enjoying the situation.

％Ｂ
「A-Anyway! You gonna go home for today?」
Touko
「Huh? Oh, mhm. I was planning to... Did you need something from me?」

％Ｂ
「Uh... I did, but it can wait. I don't think... No, there's no way it'd work out today.」

Touko
「Really? Well, if you say so.」
There were a lot of things I hadn't been expecting today.
I'm gonna try again once I've regrouped and prepared myself.
Touko
「Mmm... Then could you help me with something?」
％Ｂ
「Help? Help... with what?」
Touko
「You're a member of the event committee, right? Your job is to support the clubs for events, right?」

％Ｂ
「Y-Yeah! So are you interested in...!?」
Touko
「I want you to help with my club activities too. That's exactly the kinda thing the event committee does, right?」

％Ｂ
「Your club? You said you weren't part of any club, though.」

Touko
「Mhm. I'm part of the go-home club.」
％Ｂ
「Wha...?」
Touko
「My activities include things like finding a satisfying way to waste time on the way home. It's an intense clash of budget and time, you know.」


...That's just her way of saying she plays around on the way home.
％Ｂ
「O-Okay, listen to me. The event committee's for supporting clubs that participate in events. It's not like we're helpers for club activities...」

Touko
「You want to try to recruit me to join, don't you? You might have the opportunity to do that during my go-home club activities.」

％Ｂ
「...Well, you're not wrong.」
I can't say no then.
It's definitely an opportunity. I might as well tag along.
％Ｂ
「...All right. I'll help out with your club activities.」
Touko
「Okaaay. All right, let's get going, then.」
Touko
「Now then, where should I go today?」
％Ｂ
「How well do you know this city?」
Touko
「Hm? What do you mean?」
％Ｂ
「I only know the Shionagi from a while ago. I figured you might know the more recent side better.」

Touko
「I don't really know it that well. All I do is spend my free time wandering around and exploring.」

％Ｂ
「Exploring? Not taking walks?」
Touko
「Don't you think places you don't know are exciting? Isn't it fun thinking about where a street might lead?」

％Ｂ
「I guess I get what you mean in terms of it being a discovery. Don't you ever get lost doing stuff like that?」

Touko
「Oh, all the time. That's why I've learned how to use the map on my phone.」

I see. So she learned how to do that out of necessity.
So she just freely explores the city... That's kind of amazing.
Touko
「You said "the Shionagi from a while ago." Are you from here?」

％Ｂ
「Yeah. I lived here until I was about ten. That's how I know Shinozaki.」

Touko
「So it's not because you just hit on her the moment you transferred in. You knew her from a while ago... so she's a childhood friend?」

％Ｂ
「I dunno if it's that close of a relationship. We sent each other greeting cards for New Year's and the summer, but we never called each other or anything.」


Touko
「Oh really. I think even sending greetings is a big deal, though.」

％Ｂ
「Well, you don't really have to worry about what to say for stuff like that. You can send anyone those kinds of greetings, don't you think?」

Touko
「...You might be right.」
all
She spins on the spot and veers along the path.
I almost get left behind by her sudden change in direction.
％Ｂ
「Y-Yukimura! Tell me if you're gonna turn like that!」
Touko
「Mm? Oh, sorry about that! I just walked the way I usually do out of habit.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, but... you didn't have to turn that suddenly.」
Touko
「I just felt like it. I would've told you beforehand if I was planning on doing it.」

％Ｂ
「...Wha? The heck's that mean?」
Touko
「I just felt it, right at that corner. Would've been a waste not to turn, right?」

Uhh... I have no idea what she's getting at.
Maybe it's something I'll understand if I keep tagging along with her go-home club activities in the future?

Touko
「Oh, let's go in that store. I feel like there's something interesting there.」
all
％Ｂ
「H-Hey! Yukimura!?」
Touko
「Mmm, that wasn't that great. What a shame.」
I lost sight of Yukimura several times in that store, and it wasn't even that big.
I'd look away for a second, and then she'd just suddenly disappear...
Touko
「You're going to get separated from me if you don't follow me closely, you know.」
％Ｂ
「It's 'cause you move around too freely...」
Touko
「Mm, tired? Wanna take a bit of a break?」
％Ｂ
「...That'd be great.」
Touko
「Okay. I think I'll do you a bit of a favor for coming along with me today.」

％Ｂ
「A favor? ...Wait, where are you going?」
Touko
「Don't worry, just sit there and wait. I'll be back really soon.」
all
She's gone off somewhere.
She said she'd be back soon, so I guess I'll just wait here.
％Ｂ
「But man... a lot's changed in Shionagi.」
My memories of what things were like in the past occasionally floated to mind as I was looking around while following Yukimura.

The memories made me feel warm and nostalgic.
There are things that have changed, and some things that haven't.
Everything that's nostalgic to me is still a new discovery for Yukimura.

％Ｂ
「...It was years ago. My perspective's changed since then... I guess I shouldn't be surprised things look different.」

Back when I was small... I had to look up at all the sights around me.
It might be inevitable that there's a slight difference between the scenery in my memories and now.
That's when I realize.
Yukimura's transferred over and over... She can't wax nostalgic like this.

She's always getting herself interested in one new thing after another.
That might be why she likes exploring so much.
Touko
「Thanks for waitiiing! Here, you can have this.」
％Ｂ
「What? Really?」
Yukimura comes back holding a crêpe in each hand.
She holds one out to me.
Touko
「No need to be shy. Oh, but don't eat all of it, okay?」

％Ｂ
「Wha?」
Touko
「Let's split both of them. I wanted to eat both of them, but then I'd get fat.」

％Ｂ
「I'll have some, then. What flavor's this one?」
Touko
「That one's strawberry. And this one's banana.」
Ah, I see. Yeah, I wouldn't know which one I'd want either.
I can totally understand why she'd want to eat both.
Though I'd just eat both.
Touko
「Let's eeeat... Amh. Mmm～ It's good.」
％Ｂ
「...Yeah. It's good.」
Touko
「I had one of these crêpes right after I came to Shionagi, and I've been hooked ever since. I've never liked that I could only eat one a day.」


％Ｂ
「...Yeah, I dunno if I'd wanna see a girl pigging out on two crêpes at the same time...」

It'd be kinda weird.
I'd want her to at least do that somewhere private.
Touko
「...Mmh. Okay, I'm done with my half, so let's trade.」
％Ｂ
「S-Sure.」
I take one last bite to get mine down to about half its original size, and we trade.\n\r

Now Yukimura's got strawberry and I've got banana.
all
％Ｂ
「...」
This is... an indirect kiss, right?
Does Yukimura not care about stuff like that...?
Touko
「Mmm, the strawberry's good too! Oh, aren't you going to eat that? Don't like bananas?」

％Ｂ
「Oh, uh... No, I like bananas.」
She's biting into where I was just eating.
I guess I shouldn't let myself be the only one who's worried about something like this. No need for me to hesitate, then...
％Ｂ
「...Mh, this is good too. The sourness of the strawberries is a nice touch.」

Touko
「The other ones are good too. Let's eat together again if we get the chance.」

I give a start.
Does that mean... I'd get to trade crêpes back and forth with her again?

Touko
「...Don't move, okay?」
％Ｂ
「Wh-What...?」
I freeze. My heart's beating fast.
I can't help but remember what happened in the old school building when she peers at my face.

Yukimura's smell, warmth, and softness.
It's all vivid in my memory, shaking my heart up and down.
Touko
「You've got whipped cream on your cheek.」
％Ｂ
「Wha!? Wha, wait...!」
Her slender finger touches my cheek.
She strokes it down to gently scoop up the whipped cream, and smiles happily.

Touko
「Mm... chu. Ahaha, did that get your heart going?」
％Ｂ
「Y-You're just...! Are you having fun messing with me?」
Touko
「Mmm... Well, I think it's probably the most fun I've had since coming to Shionagi.」

％Ｂ
「Huh?」
Didn't expect that answer.
I was totally expecting her to say something like, "This is just a good way to kill time."

Touko
「Okay, let's get going. Let's explore a little more, before the sun goes down!」

all
Touko
「Ahh, we walked around so much today.」
It was only for a little longer than an hour, but I'm crazy tired...
Yukimura's seriously like a cat, the way she immediately disappears the moment you take your eyes off her.

％Ｂ
「I-I'm exhausted... You always wander around this much?」
Touko
「Mmm... I think I get bored quicker, usually. Today went on for a bit longer because it was kinda fun.」

...She seems like she's in a pretty good mood.
I should make sure to bring up the event committee stuff again after I tagged along with her this whole time.

％Ｂ
「Hey, Yukimura. About the event committee.」
Touko
「Mm? Oh, yeah. I remember you talking about something like that.」
％Ｂ
「...What do you think I've been following you around this whole time for?」

Touko
「Ahaha, I'm kidding. Don't worry, I remember.」
％Ｂ
「I still think it'd be the best way for you to say no to the clubs trying to recruit you. So I've come up with another condition.」

Touko
「A condition? What's that?」
％Ｂ
「You only need to participate in the committee. I'll handle all the work you're assigned to. You can help me out if you get interested later on.」


Touko
「Mmm... Does that have any upsides for you?」
％Ｂ
「Not really, I guess. But it'd be good for both you and the event committee.」

Touko
「I get why it's good for me... but what's the committee get out of it?」

％Ｂ
「'Cause you're famous. It'd be a talking point if you joined.」
Touko
「...It doesn't feel very good to be treated that way.」
She still doesn't seem too receptive...
I need to find some way to pique her interest...

Touko
「Oh, it's a cat! C'mere, come over heeere～!」
all
％Ｂ
「Wha, Yukimura!? I'm not done...!」
She immediately goes bouncing over after spotting a stray cat.
Looks like she doesn't care about the committee talk anymore.
Touko
「You're so cuuute... You're different from the one I played with the other day. Is this your territory too?」

Touko
「Want some snacks? Here, I'll give you a cookie.」
％Ｂ
「Do cats eat cookies?」
Touko
「Yeah, but you shouldn't give them too much. It seems okay if you give them a little bit that's been crumbled up.」

％Ｂ
「Huh... I see.」
Touko
「Though it can't have chocolate. Cats get sick if they eat chocolate.」

She places a small cookie fragment on the palm of her hand and holds it out to the cat.
It sniffs it, but then turns away.

Touko
「Oh... maybe he doesn't like cookies.」
％Ｂ
「Well that's awful spoiled of him... It looks like a perfectly good cookie.」
Touko
「Do you want to eat it, then? It's crumbled up, but here.」

...And what am I supposed to do when you stick your hand out like that?
Is she expecting me to just stuff my face in her palm and eat it?
Touko
「What, you won't eat it either? It's tasty, though.」
Oh. I guess I could've just grabbed it with my hand.
I wouldn't have needed to eat it like a cat.
Touko
「I guess something meaty like jerky would be better... Maybe I should keep some on me, starting tomorrow.」

％Ｂ
「You sure like cats.」
Touko
「Mhm. I think the way they're prickly and carefree is really cute.」

That seals the Yukimura ＝ cat equation in my mind.
I feel like I can see cat ears sticking out of her head now.
％Ｂ
「It's a shame he didn't like you.」
Touko
「Cats usually like me, though... I like doggies too, but they always seem to hate me. I wonder why.」


％Ｂ
「Probably 'cause cats and dogs usually don't get along.」
Touko
「Hm? What's that mean?」
She looks at me curiously. I guess she doesn't really realize how catlike she is.
It's kinda funny seeing her look at me like that. It's also catlike.
Touko
「Well, whatever. I think I'll go home now.」
％Ｂ
「It's pretty late. Want me to walk you home?」
Touko
「It's fine. I'll be wandering around a bit more on my way home. Bye theeen. You should hurry home too, okaaay?」

all
％Ｂ
「Oh...」
She left before I could get another word in.
I was gonna try to convince her to join the committee again on the way home, but she escaped yet again.

％Ｂ
「...This really is hard.」
I can suddenly taste the sweetness of the crêpes from earlier again.
They tasted sweeter than anything I've ever had up until now... Or at least, that's what it felt like.
