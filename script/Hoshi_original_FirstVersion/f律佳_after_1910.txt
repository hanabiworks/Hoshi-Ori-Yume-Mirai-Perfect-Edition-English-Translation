From school to the workforce.
From living together to marriage.
Lately, I've been thinking a lot about becoming a family... about what a family's like.
The seasons change, from autumn to winter.
Winning an internationally renowned contest certainly has its benefits.

It was decided that Rikka would be participating in the Moscow Philharmonic Orchestra's yearly Japan concert.
Rikka's currently in Moscow at the orchestra's invitation.
I have work, so I'm sitting home alone...
Meguru
「You're lonely, aren't you, Nii-san～?」
...Or I would be, if Meguru-chan hadn't just happened to come back to Japan.

She always drops by like this whenever she has work in Japan.
％Ｂ
「Rikka's doing her best out there. I'm happy, not lonely.」
Meguru
「I think you can be happy and lonely at the same time, you know. Honely? Hmm～ ...Maybe lappy sounds cuter?」
％Ｂ
「Rikka and I are connected through our hearts, so distance doesn't matter. We don't need to be together all the time like kids.」
Meguru
「How very mature of you, Nii-san. Here I was thinking I would comfort you.」
Meguru
「Oh, I didn't mean that in a dirty way, just so you know.」
％Ｂ
「Yep. I know.」
Meguru
「Mmhhh... That response is quite frustrating in its own way.」
She must have come here because she thought I'd be lonely.
I actually am lonely on the inside, so I'm genuinely grateful she's here.

％Ｂ
「How about you find a boyfriend too already, Meguru-chan?」
Meguru
「The piano is my lover. I'd consider it if I found someone wonderful like Onee-chan has, though.」


Meguru
「But finding a soulmate is rather difficult, isn't it?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. I was probably just lucky.」
Someone who's so precious you might not ever get to meet them in your lifetime.
That must be why you call them a soulmate.\n\r
Meeting Rikka is the happiest, most fortunate thing that's happened in my entire life.
Meguru
「That, and I don't have the time for it at the moment because of my work. Just look at my schedule. I'm booked for the next five years.」


She pulls out a compact, but still impressively dense schedule notebook.

The calendar's completely packed with writing in black ink.
Meguru-chan's currently doing tons of work both overseas and in Japan.

％Ｂ
「That's really something. Looks like you go to a lot of different countries.」
Meguru
「I'm just glad I don't have to travel too much this month. I expended more energy traveling than actually playing last month with all the back-and-forth trips I had to take between Europe and America.」
Meguru
「Though I'm very glad to have work to do.」
％Ｂ
「I feel kinda bad that you came to visit me when your schedule's that packed.」
Meguru
「Oh, please don't worry. I just wanted to come see you. Relaxing at a hotel just doesn't seem very private to me.」
Meguru
「But it's not like anyone's at home at the moment either. Fortunately enough, I have a very comforting older brother! ...Is my train of thought.」
％Ｂ
「I'm glad I was able to be of help.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, you hungry? I'll make you food, if you're fine with something simple.」
Meguru
「Yay! Onee-chan's cooking is delicious, but I love your cooking too!」
％Ｂ
「I'll get some ready then. Just a second.」
Meguru
「Okaaay!」
all
I get up and head toward the kitchen.
Meguru
「Nii-san's cookiiing～♪ Nii-san's cookiiing～♪」
I can hear her happy, rhythmic voice from behind me.
The way she acts around me hasn't changed since we were in high school, but I bet being a professional piano player who flies around all over the world is a lot of work.
I can tell just from looking at that schedule of hers.
A thought crosses my mind.
...I wonder if Rikka's gonna become a pianist who's booked five years into the future like that.

It's what I'd want.
I want to support my girlfriend as she tries to make her way as a professional musician.
That's the truth.
But...
I bet it'd be hard to live the way we do now if that happens.

It's a sad, painful thought.
Maybe I could travel around the world with her.
But I have my own dream of becoming a first-rate architect under Mr. Azuma's tutelage.
Our hearts may be connected, but our paths before us branch away from one another.
Life's so happy right now. I wonder if I could take it... Shards of doubt gouge into my heart.
％Ｂ
「Here you go. Carbonara.」
Meguru
「Wow, that smells great. Eheheeeh～ ...Slrp, auh... I drooled.」
％Ｂ
「Haha, I'll make more if you want some, so just let me know.」
I place a plate for myself on the table and sit across from Meguru-chan.
Meguru
「Chomp chomp... Mmm～ Delicious! You've improved your skills yet again, Nii-san. You could open up a restaurant with this.」
Meguru
「Eating your and Onee-chan's cooking really makes me go, "Now I know I'm back in Japan～" Hehehe.」
She's eating happily.
I watch her and idly twirl the pasta with my fork.
Meguru
「...? Aren't you going to eat?」
％Ｂ
「Meguru-chan. Are you glad you became a professional pianist?」
Meguru
「What a strange question. I wouldn't still be doing it if I wasn't.」
Meguru
「There are people out there in the world who are excited to hear me perform. I couldn't imagine anything that would make me happier.」
Meguru
「I want the people of the world to hear me. "This is my piano! Let it resonate in your hearts!" Like that.」
Meguru
「Ehehehe, I'm piano-crazy from start to finish, aren't I?」
％Ｂ
「I think that's just fine. I admire the way you live.」

To devote yourself to chasing after one specific thing, believing in yourself as you charge forward.
Architecture still holds an important place in my heart, of course.
But...
Now that I have other things that are important to me as well, I can't devote myself to one thing in that way.
I feel like I'm always balancing things unsteadily on a set of scales.
Meguru
「Is this about Onee-chan?」
％Ｂ
「Huh?」
Meguru
「I can tell by the look on your face. And even without that, the way you asked made it all too obvious.」
％Ｂ
「Sorry. Could I get your opinion on something?」
Meguru
「Yes! Of course!」
Her response is prompt and cheery.
％Ｂ
「Thanks. What do you think about the idea of getting married and then immediately living apart from each other?」
Meguru
「Wha... You aren't going to live with Onee-chan?」
％Ｂ
「I wanna live together, of course. But I also want Rikka to get more work and become famous.」
％Ｂ
「Isn't it better for her to work overseas like you do, then?」

Meguru
「Well... At least in my own experience, I feel that the West has higher appreciation for the arts than Japan.」
Meguru
「There are just so many different kinds of people, and it's all the more stimulating a place for it. Every day is a new experience.」

Meguru
「Piano is a lifelong study... I still believe so, even after becoming a professional. From that perspective, the West is a place where one can grow day after day.」
％Ｂ
「Really...」
I guess I really should let Rikka go out into the world...
Meguru
「Though that's just how things are for me.」
She looks straight into my eyes.
As if to try to communicate something to me, as directly as possible.
Meguru
「Your dream is to become an architect, right? If you had to break up with Onee-chan for that to come true, would you throw her away?」
％Ｂ
「Th-There's no way I could do that!」
Meguru
「Then let's say that in order for you to become an architect, you must live apart from Onee-chan. What would you do if Onee-chan sent you out into the world to do so?」


If Rikka...?
％Ｂ
「It'd make me happy... but also sad, I think.」
I know she'd be doing it for my sake, but it makes my heart hurt.
all
％Ｂ
「Oh...」
That's when I realize.
Maybe... what I've been thinking would be best for Rikka's sake might just be me forcing something onto her.

Am I really thinking the same way Rikka is?
Just like how I thought I'd be happy but sad, maybe she...
Meguru
「Narusawa Meguru as a private individual does not know love.」
％Ｂ
「Huh?」
Meguru
「That's why Narusawa Meguru as a pianist is able to distribute her love evenly across many listeners. Keeping your private life and work life separate is easy on paper, but it's rather difficult, isn't it.」
Meguru
「I don't know if I would be able to stay the way I am now if I fell in love with someone. I wouldn't think of that as good or bad, but rather a necessary change.」
Meguru
「Onee-chan fell in love with you, and learned how it felt to love you...」

Meguru
「The way she feels now when she plays piano is definitely different from when she first started.」

Meguru
「I'm sure she's always wanted many people to listen to her piano, but do you think that's all there is?」
％Ｂ
「...」
Rikka
「I still don't know what the best possible choice is. And I want to stay by your side for now, so I can find what that is.」

...I wonder if Rikka's found it.
The best possible choice.
And I...
I know I told her back then that we'd search for that together.
％Ｂ
「Here.」
I grab a neat roll of paper off my desk and unfurl it.
Meguru
「What's that? A blueprint of a house?」
％Ｂ
「This is what I was asked to make as a promotion exam. It's the blueprint for a house that I'd be living in ten years from now.」

％Ｂ
「At first, when I was asked to do this, I didn't know if I should talk about it with Rikka. I felt like I'd be limiting her future.」
Meguru
「That would just be you worrying too much, Nii-san.」
％Ｂ
「Rikka was really happy when I told her about it.」
Meguru
「Of course she would be. Any girl would be happy if she were asked by the person she loves what kind of house she would want to live in.」

％Ｂ
「...I haven't been acting like myself, have I. It's an issue involving both of us, but I guess I've been worrying about it all alone, saying it's for Rikka's sake.」

I had forgotten that it's better to regret something after doing it than to regret never doing it at all.
％Ｂ
「Thanks for the advice, Meguru-chan.」
Meguru
「Hehe, you can talk to me about things like this as much as you'd like. I'll do everything I can to help, if I can be of use.」

Meguru
「Because I want you and Onee-chan to be happy.」
％Ｂ
「I'll try telling Rikka how I feel. And I'll talk things over properly with her.」
Meguru
「Yes, that would be for the best. Please make Onee-chan happy, Nii-san.」

％Ｂ
「I'll do my best.」
Meguru
「Now that we're done with that...」
％Ｂ
「Hm?」
Meguru
「May I have some more pasta?」
％Ｂ
「Haha, I'll bring some out right away.」
all
I accept the empty plate from her.
I think about things on the way to the kitchen.
About how... it's time to use the money I've been saving up until now.
A little bit after Rikka came back from Moscow―
The two of us both take a day off and go on a date together.
I take her to a nostalgic place for the end of the date.
The school we parted from a few years ago welcomes us, looking the same as ever.
Rikka
「Hehe, how nostalgic. We haven't been here since we graduated. But why did you want to come here?」

％Ｂ
「Don't worry about it. Let's just go inside.」
Rikka
「Are we allowed to?」
％Ｂ
「There's no problem if we get permission.」
The receptionist I spoke with "for the second time" for getting permission to enter the school was actually the same one who allowed me inside when I first moved back to Shionagi.

Seeing her, just a little bit older now, filled me with nostalgia.
The two of us fondly walk through the school.\n\r
It's the weekend, so there's no one in the halls other than us.
We can just barely hear students calling out to each other as they devote themselves to their club activities from outside.
It's the same as when we attended this school.
And same goes for the room we spent so much time in back when we were in high school―

Rikka
「Nothing's changed here, has it...」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. It reminds me of back when I heard you play piano for the first time.」
Rikka
「The time when you, Natsuki, and Marika peeked in.」
％Ｂ
「Haha... I'd say it's more like we destroyed the mood by opening the door than we just peeked.」
I can see what I saw on that day when I close my eyes.
Vividly and clearly.
Rikka
「A lot happened with you here, didn't it? We talked about pointless things, we ate lunch, you practiced singing, you listened to me play piano... So much happened.」
％Ｂ
「It's been four years since then... We've graduated, and now we live together. I feel like we've been together for longer.」
Rikka
「Doesn't that just speak to how valuable the time we've spent together has been? Hehe, now that I think about it, I've been with you almost the entire time after we first met.」
％Ｂ
「We were lucky enough to be in the same class as third years, and we've been living in the same household since we entered university.」
Rikka
「Every day... is so filled with happiness for me. I'm living a life that's far more wonderful than I had ever imagined.」

％Ｂ
「My life changed after I met you, Rikka. I still have the same dream of becoming a first-rate architect, but meeting you made me want to try even harder.」
And I want to be the one to make Rikka happy, too.
And to do that...
％Ｂ
「I wanna hear you play again, Rikka. On this piano.」
％Ｂ
「Could you play for me? Just a bit, like you did back in high school.」
Rikka
「Hehe, okay.」
all
She walks over to the piano without any suspicions.
She starts to open the lid, and then...
Rikka
「Wha...」
She stops, her eyes wide.
She looks back and forth disbelievingly between me and the small object before her.
％Ｂ
「Open it.」
Rikka
「Oh... Hgh, ah... M-Mhm...」
She's already tearing up.
She's such a crybaby.
She retrieves a small box from inside the piano...
And opens it to reveal an engagement ring.
％Ｂ
「Narusawa Rikka-san. Please marry me.」
Rikka
「...」
She's frozen up, staring at the ring.
Eventually...
Beautiful droplets begin to fall from her eyes.
Rikka
「Gh, uuh... Sniff, ghhh... fuehh... ueehhhhnhhh...!」
She's crying like a child.
Her tears are so pretty.
I approach her, wrap my arms around her small, soft frame, and face her.

Rikka
「Wh-Whyyy... Wh-When did you... Snfh, it didn't seem like you were going to do this at all, just when did you get a ring...?」
％Ｂ
「Mm, I kept it secret 'cause I wanted to surprise you.」
％Ｂ
「I was terrified you might find it until today. Haha, I guess there are downsides to living together after all.」

Rikka
「Y-You surprised me so muuuch...! Uuuh, fueh... I thought my heart was going to stop...!」
％Ｂ
「I'm glad I succeeded.」
I look right into Rikka's eyes, and ask her again.

％Ｂ
「Rikka. Will you marry me?」
Rikka
「Y-Yes...! If you'd like it to be me, then I would love tooo...!」
％Ｂ
「Thank you.」
％Ｂ
「....Pheeew.」
I go limp all at once.
Rikka
「Sniff, hic... Wh-What's wrong?」
％Ｂ
「I was pretty nervous too, you know. I've kinda crumpled now that you've said okay.」

Rikka
「That's silly... There's no way I would ever reject a proposal from you...」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, I know... But it's a once-in-a-lifetime kinda thing... I don't think I'd ever get used to it.」

Rikka
「Hehe, and I wouldn't want you to.」
％Ｂ
「Haha, seriously. I've finished a once-in-a-lifetime task now.」
But this isn't the end of everything.
％Ｂ
「Rikka...」
％Ｂ
「That ring isn't for restraining you.」
Rikka
「...What?」
％Ｂ
「I'm sure that you'll get busier with work from now on. Like Meguru-chan is now.」
％Ｂ
「You'll have fans all over the world who are excited for your performances. If that's what you want, then I want to respect that.」

％Ｂ
「If you take flight, then you can always come back to me, and I'll be waiting for you. That's what this ring is proof of.」

Rikka
「...」
％Ｂ
「That's why I want you to tell me what you're thinking... how you feel right now.」
I can support Rikka from the bottom of my heart, even if her choice leads to us being separated.
Rikka
「...Let's walk a little.」
We walk to classroom 2-C.
Rikka walks over to the window.
The desks are still here, just like they were back then.
The soft autumn sunlight illuminates them, showcasing the new scuffs and scratches they've gotten since we took classes in this room.

Rikka
「Now then, a question.」
％Ｂ
「?」
She turns to me and shows me her phone.
Rikka
「What is the password for my locked folder? Your hint is that it's a date that I'm sure was completely ordinary for you, but became very important for me.」
％Ｂ
「Oh...」
I remember.
She's talking about the password I was never able to guess while we were in high school.
％Ｂ
「Well, let's see... Hmmhh.」
I tried guessing the dates I could think of back then, but they were all wrong.
It's not her birthday, which means it's not the anniversary of us dating either...
％Ｂ
「...Hm?」
Actually, why'd she bring me here?
If she just wanted to ask me this, she could've done it in the music classroom...
A day that was really ordinary for me, but very important for Rikka...
...No, she said it became an important day, didn't she?
So it wasn't important on the actual day of, but it became so later?
That, and the classroom...
％Ｂ
「Oh!」
I've connected the dots.
％Ｂ
「Rikka. That's a day that became important for me too.」
all
I type out the numbers on her phone.
0
6
0
2
...The day we first met.
The folder unlocks, allowing me to see its contents.
％Ｂ
「It's taken me five years, but I've finally unlocked it. Now then, let's see what kinda embarrassing photos of me you've got in―」
％Ｂ
「Wha...?」
I see embarrassing photos... Like me with a pathetic look on my face, or photos where I just happened to be making a weird face...
But that's not all.
It's not just photos of me. I see Segawa, Shinozaki, her other friends, Meguru-chan, the other members of the committee, people she met in university...
Everything that's happened since the two of us met.
Rikka
「Correct. Hehe... This is my answer.」
Rikka
「I only decided to try to become a professional pianist again after I met you and all of the people who supported me. My sound is something I've nurtured with you and everyone else...」
Rikka
「The place where I can be most like myself... The place where I can play with the sound that most sounds like me... is by your side.」
％Ｂ
「Are you sure you're okay with that?」
Rikka
「It's selfish.」
％Ｂ
「Wha?」
Rikka
「I don't want to sacrifice anything. I want to become a pianist, and I want to live a happy married life with you too. I don't want just one or the other.」
Rikka
「So this is me being selfish. I can accept any hardships that come my way and do my best for that.」
Rikka
「Besides, I can play music anywhere. I can play anywhere as long as I have a piano, just like how a poet can write poetry as long as they have paper and pen.」
Rikka
「What happens from now on is all up to me. If I can play so wonderfully it enraptures the hearts of people across the world, then where I play doesn't matter... No. I'll make it not matter.」

Rikka
「I'll play my piano for the hearts of people all across the world, from your side.」
Rikka's words are just like the melodies from her piano.
They find their way directly to my heart.
all
％Ｂ
「...I can't lose, can I?」
If Rikka's gonna marry me and become a pianist who can move the hearts of people all over the world...

Then I'm gonna have to marry Rikka and become an architect acknowledged by people all over the world.
Sayaka
『Hello? Rikka?』
Rikka
「Hello? Mom? Do you have time? There's something I want to talk about.」

Sayaka
『What's wrong? Why so formal?』
Rikka
「...You see... There's someone I want you to meet sometime. He's someone very important to me.」

Sayaka
『Oh... Oh my, fufu. Is it Ryousuke-kun?』
Sayaka
『Oh... Oh my, fufu. Is it the man I'm thinking of?』
Rikka
「Mhm... Um, he... proposed to me today.」
Sayaka
『I see. That's great. Congratulations.』
Rikka
「Mhm... Thank you, hehehe...」
Sayaka
『So you've decided on your path, then?』
Rikka
「I'm going to continue playing piano by his side.」
Sayaka
『I thought you'd pick that option. So have you already started preparing?』

Rikka
「No, that starts now. He and I will both be busy this next year, so I don't think it'll be for a while.」

Sayaka
『Then let's meet next year at your Japan concert. It'd be difficult to come all the way overseas for you two, right? I'll let your father know as well.』


Rikka
「That'd be great. We should really be the ones to come to you, but we'd like to avoid spending money so we can save up for our wedding...」
Sayaka
『Hehe, sounds promising already.』
Rikka
「Uuuh... G-Geez... Don't tease me.」
Sayaka
『Fufu. Say hello to Ryousuke-kun for me, then. If there's anything we can do to help, just call. Good night.』
Sayaka
『Fufu. Say hello to your husband-to-be for me, then. If there's anything we can do to help, just call. Good night.』
Rikka
「Mhm. Good night.」
I hang up.
But my heart's still beating out a dial tone's worth of rhythm.
Fast, beautiful, and comfortable...
Thump, thump, thump...
Rikka
「My heart... is currently playing the happiest melody in the world.」
