Touko
「Is it here yeeet～? What if they messed up and didn't send mine out...?」

It's been about a week since we were notified that the results of the interior design coordinator qualification exams were sent out in the mail.

I'm taking it easy on my day off, and to contrast, Touko's completely restless.

％Ｂ
「Calm down. There's no point in getting that worried, is there?」
Touko
「I can't help iiit... It came earlier last year, didn't it? I'm not into this kinda frustration roleplay.」

What the hell are you talking about...?
This must be pretty rough on her, since she's never been particularly good at waiting.

Touko
「I wish they'd just show the results on the internet...! I think it's really old fashioned of them to only use the postal service in this day and age.」

％Ｂ
「...You know you're terrible with technology, right?」
Touko
「I'd have you do it if I couldn't figure it out. You should praise me for being able to use the internet and check my mail now.」


％Ｂ
「You made me do literally everything to set that stuff up...」
Those are necessary skills for living in modern society...
I know better than anyone how hard it is to teach Touko something she doesn't care about, so there's no point in harping on about it any further.

Touko
「Oh, isn't that it!? That has to be them saying I passed! Yeees, be right theeere!」

all
Touko immediately runs to the door.
This is the most agile I've seen her in a while.
Touko
「...My mom sent us a package... It's fish roe... Looks great...」

％Ｂ
「O-Okay... I see... Don't get so down. It's good that we have something good to eat, right?」

What's up with that bitter disappointment?
The fish roe's blameless. Don't look so sad while clutching the box like that...

Touko
「Geez～ Why'd she send this to me now～!? What kinda cruel joke is this!?」

％Ｂ
「Wanna call them if you're that worried? There could've been a mistake or something with the mail.」

Touko
「Is that it this time!? Yeeees!」
all
Touko
「...Here. A package for yooou.」
％Ｂ
「...Thanks.」
It's the pencil case I ordered online last week.
Don't look at me like that. It isn't my fault...
％Ｂ
「We don't know when it's gonna show up, so you wanna go out somewhere to clear your mind? I bet it'll have been delivered by the time we get back.」


Touko
「I can't focus on a date with how worried I am～! I won't be able to taste dessert!」

％Ｂ
「...I never said we were gonna get sweets.」

Touko
「A tart filled with fruits! Pancakes with lots of maple syrup! Warabi-mochi red bean soup almond jelly～!」


...Not good. She's clearly really stressed.
I've triggered something I shouldn't have...
％Ｂ
「Nothing's gonna change if you freak out, so just calm down and...」
Touko
「It's here! This has to be it! Yeees, yes yeeees!」
all
％Ｂ
「...Ignored.」
Touko
「Look look, it's different from last year! Maybe I passed this year!?」

Touko's holding an envelope.
It's clearly a different design from the simple card that notified her she failed last year.
％Ｂ
「Let's look inside. We can't be sure until we see it say you've passed.」

Touko
「O-Okay...! I'll open it...!」
all
She carefully tears it open.
Oh god, I'm starting to get nervous too...!
Touko
「...I did iiiit! I passed! There you go! I can do it if I try!」

％Ｂ
「Seriously!? That's awesome, Touko!」
We hug each other in joy.
There's still the second exam, but this is a really great start.
Touko
「Ahhhh... I've finally taken a step forward...! It took a long time, but I'm so glad I put in all that effort...!」

％Ｂ
「Great job! You really did put in a ton of effort!」
Touko
「Ahh... I'm feeling lighter in a lot of ways now...! Having my head petted feels extra special today.」

％Ｂ
「You'll have to get started on preparing for the second exam now. You wanna pass that on the first try now that you've passed this one, right?」


Touko
「Yeah, but I'm going to rest a little nooow... I'm going to have you praise me looots
, Ryousuke

!」
She nuzzles up to me.
Well... Let's savor our happiness, just for today.
％Ｂ
「Okay. How about I make something to celebrate today, then? I could make some pasta with that fish roe from earlier.」

Touko
「Yaaay! Oh, I need to thank my mom! And I wanna tell her I passed!」

She starts tapping at her phone, all smiles.
Seeing her so happy about everything's making me happy too.
Touko
「Oh, hello, Mom!? I did it, I passed my exam! Oh, and we got the fish roe you sent too. Thanks! I can't believe you sent it as an early celebration gift! You're amazing!」


Fish roe to celebrate her passing the exam...?
I feel like I'd be kinda happy, kinda not... though I mean, it's good stuff, so it's fine by me.

Touko
「Mhm, he said we're going to celebrate now! Don't worry, I thanked him already. Ahaha, yeah. Let's talk about that when you come over here, okay?」


All right. Let's get started with preparations.
Just pasta doesn't seem like enough, so I'll make some dessert too.
Congratulations, Touko.
