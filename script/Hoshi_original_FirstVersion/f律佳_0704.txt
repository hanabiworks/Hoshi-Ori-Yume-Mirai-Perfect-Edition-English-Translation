The fish open and close their mouths as they eat the food I've sprinkled in their tanks.
I'm in charge of feeding them today.\n\r
The room's become a pretty legitimate aquarium, with lots of fish and fish tanks.
％Ｂ
「Studying around a bunch of fish tanks feels kinda weird.」
Rikka
「It does. It's almost like we're studying in an aquarium.」
Narusawa's studying with me in the second chemistry classroom after helping me feed the fish.

all
But I'm not making too much progress.
To be more specific, I'm totally distracted.
Because of what happened the day before yesterday.
Narusawa said she'd be waiting for my kiss.
When it's just the two of us together like this...
"I'll be waiting... for your kiss." ＋ "We're currently alone." ＝ "Should I do it now!?"
The equation dominates my thoughts.
...I shouldn't do it while we're studying, right?
But she might've been waiting for it this whole time...
Rikka
「Is there something you don't understand?」
％Ｂ
「Huh?」
Rikka
「It doesn't seem like you've been making much progress. I'll help you if it's something I understand. Show me where...」

She pulls herself closer and peers at my textbook.
A distinctive girly smell swells in my nostrils, and my brain goes numb.

Rikka
「...Oh? Weren't you solving problems with this structure yesterday?」
％Ｂ
「...」
Rikka
「...Are you listening?」
Narusawa's lips move seductively, forming the syllables of my name.
Her lips are a little thin, but they still have a girly shape. They look really soft.

Rikka
「Hey... Are you listening?」
％Ｂ
「Oh, my bad. I might be a little off today.」
Rikka
「I see. Let's go home, then.」
％Ｂ
「But you went to the trouble of staying here with me.」
Rikka
「Don't say I went to the trouble. I'm here because I want to be. I was really happy when you asked me to study with you.」
Rikka
「Forcing yourself to study when you're off is just inefficient. There's still tomorrow, so you should save your mental energy for then.」

We don't have school tomorrow, but we've agreed to study together at my house.
％Ｂ
「Yeah, you're right. Let's go.」
Rikka
「Yes.」
We lock up the second chemistry classroom and head toward the entranceway...
And we run into a certain small someone wobbling unsteadily down the hall.
She's carrying a big telescope that seems at odds with her small frame.

％Ｂ
「Yo, Ousaka. Gonna go look at the stars?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「But club activities aren't allowed right now.」
She should be aware of that, since she was there at Narusawa's house too last night.

She looks at us, then the telescope, then thinks for a while.
Sora
「Hobby.」
％Ｂ
「I get it. Not club activities, then.」
Sora
「No issues.」
％Ｂ
「But doesn't that mean you can't use your club's key to go up on the roof?」

I decide to ask a bit of a mean question.
Sora
「...」
Sora
「...Club activities.」
％Ｂ
「Club activities are currently not allowed.」
Sora
「Mean.」
％Ｂ
「Haha, sorry. You're gonna take this up to the roof, right? I'll hold it.」
I take the telescope from Ousaka and put it over my shoulder.
Sora
「...Is it okay?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, I'll stay quiet for you. You mind if we take a bit of a detour, Narusawa?」

Rikka
「Of course not.」
Sora
「Will you keep it a secret too, Ritsu?」
Rikka
「Yes. But why did you want to look at the stars today?」
Sora
「There aren't any clouds today and it isn't a full moon. Perfect weather.」
Sora
「I'm sure I'll see the stars clearly.」
We carry the telescope up to the rooftop, and then go back down to the school gates.
I turn around and look up at the school. I can see something glinting in the dull sunlight.

％Ｂ
「Seeing the stars clearly, huh?」
I turn toward the direction of Narusawa's house, and then stop.
％Ｂ
「Wanna go see the stars too? Take a break from studying.」
Rikka
「I don't mind, but do you want to go back up to the rooftop?」
％Ｂ
「We could, but I'd feel bad to take the telescope away from her.」
％Ｂ
「I think I might have an idea of where we could see them clearly.」
The beach is about as empty as I expected.
This area's far from the city lights, so it's easy to see the stars.

％Ｂ
「Yeah, I remembered right. It was like this back when I ran away from home too.」

Rikka
「Hehe. I can see lots of stars. It looks like you found other benefits when you ran away from home.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah. Let's walk a little.」
I casually hold out my hand.
She casually takes it.
It's very natural.
We tangle our fingers together into a lover's hold.
all
The warmth from the palms of our hands feels wonderful in the slightly cold seaside breeze.

Narusawa and I walk alongside the waves beneath a sky so full of stars I feel like they might start dripping down on us from above.

The sound of our footsteps in the sand bounces back and forth like a pleasant conversation.

The two of us eventually sit down next to each other a little ways away from the shoreline.
％Ｂ
「Didn't think you could see the Milky Way this clearly on days other than Tanabata.」
Rikka
「Yes, people only ever think about the Orihime and Hikoboshi story. But having something you could only ever see once a year sounds like it could be beautiful.」


％Ｂ
「I like that. I guess you're kind of a romantic, huh?」
Rikka
「You're the one who started talking about this first. Any girl can imagine that much.」

She squeezes my hand a little out of embarrassment.
％Ｂ
「I wasn't teasing you. I used to imagine lots of stuff when I looked at the stars too.」

％Ｂ
「Like that one's the airplane constellation, and I think maybe that one's the missile constellation...」
Rikka
「What on earth?」
％Ｂ
「Hmm～ ...I don't really remember. I just said stuff like that back then. Seeing the stars reminded me.」


％Ｂ
「I guess it must've been like looking at the clouds and seeing dogs or ice cream.」

％Ｂ
「Like for example, that one, that one, and that one. And that, and that one.」
I just point at random stars in the sky.
％Ｂ
「The ground beef steak constellation.」
Rikka
「Pff... The ground beef steak constellation? It's just an ellipse.」
％Ｂ
「Well... I was just kinda thinking about how I'm hungry.」
Rikka
「Geez... I'll make you some tomorrow.」
％Ｂ
「Whoa, seriously!? Thanks! I'm twice as motivated to study tomorrow now!」

Rikka
「Hehe. I'm glad you're finally motivated now.」
％Ｂ
「Then how about that one, that one, that one, and that one... That one over there, and then that one...」

I point at a complex series of stars.
％Ｂ
「All right, what do you think that one is?」
Rikka
「The last one was ground beef steak, so... the fried shrimp constellation?」
％Ｂ
「Hahaha! Gotcha. It's the fried fish constellation.」
Rikka
「Mmhh... I don't see it.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, come on, you can't? It's not like you can see most of the constellations anyway.」

％Ｂ
「You try making one too then. I'll tell you if I can see it or not.」

Rikka
「Hmm...mh, let's see...」
Rikka
「Then that one, and that one over there. And then that one, and then that one after that...」

Narusawa points out a warped-looking ring of clusters that eventually returns to the initial one.
％Ｂ
「I know! It's the fried egg constellation.」
Rikka
「Wrong. Why is it all food with you?」
％Ｂ
「Ground beef steak with fried egg's a staple, isn't it?」
Rikka
「Fine, okay. I'll add on fried egg and fried shrimp to the ground beef steak tomorrow. Oh... No, you wanted fried fish, didn't you?」

％Ｂ
「Fried shrimp, please.」
I bow my head in defeat in response to Narusawa's teasing.
We look at each other and smile.
％Ｂ
「So what was the answer to yours then?」
Rikka
「...The heart constellation.」
She averts her eyes.
I look up and connect the dots, so to say.
％Ｂ
「Haha, you're right, it is a heart. Is this another one of those things any girl would think of?」
Rikka
「That's right. I'm sure anyone would.」
I can't really believe that literally every single girl in the world would think that... so I guess it's just that Narusawa's got a cute way of thinking.

％Ｂ
「All right, I've memorized it. I'll remember those stars as the heart constellation from now on.」

Rikka
「Please don't.」
％Ｂ
「Why not? I think it's romantic and cute.」
Rikka
「...I'm embarrassed I said it now. So forget it.」

％Ｂ
「Nope. Not happening.」
Rikka
「Is it that fun to bully me?」
％Ｂ
「That's not why. This is another memory with you for me. I wanna keep even the smallest things close to my heart.」

Rikka
「Auuuh... But it's still embarrassing...」
Let's keep quiet about how a small part of me thinks she's cute when she's being teased.
You don't have to be her boyfriend to see that Narusawa's cute both inside and outside.
I still can't believe she agreed to be my girlfriend.
But here she is, right next to me.
Holding my hand.
Rikka
「Lalalalalalala, lalalalalalala.」

Rikka
「You sang that for me when I had doubts.」
％Ｂ
「That I did.」
Rikka
「I was so happy that you would sing for me.」
Rikka
「I already liked you by that point, so that might have just made things worse. That made me like you even more.」
％Ｂ
「...Did you really?」
That's a bit of a surprise.
I was thinking she had softened around me at that point, but I didn't know she liked me already...

Rikka
「I liked you so much I didn't know what to do with myself... I almost confessed, but I stopped myself because I was scared.」

％Ｂ
「Wha... You almost confessed? When we were here before?」
Rikka
「Mhm. I don't think you noticed, since you were focused on us holding hands.」

％Ｂ
「...」
...You're kidding me.
That's actually pretty shocking.
Rikka
「What's wrong?」
％Ｂ
「I'm just kinda shook up about how I let the opportunity for you to confess slip by.」

Rikka
「I'm glad you didn't hear me. Because I got to hear you tell me how you feel.」

％Ｂ
「I don't regret being the one to confess. I was just thinking I might wanna hear you do it too.」

Rikka
「Do you really want to hear it that badly?」
％Ｂ
「I do.」
Rikka
「Hehe. You're really passionate about that.」
％Ｂ
「Of course I am. It's about hearing you confess to me.」
Rikka
「Then... It's a bit embarrassing, but listen carefully.」
Rikka
「Because these are precious words that I'll only say once in my life, and only to you.」
She pauses, as if to organize her feelings, and looks right into my eyes.
Rikka
「
Hino-kun... 

I like you. My heart has been beating out a very comfortable rhythm ever since I first felt your kindness.」
Rikka
「It grew bigger and bigger with each passing day. I nurtured those feelings inside of me, until it became a wonderful melody.」

Rikka
「You are the first person I have ever thought of so dearly. I would be very happy if you could accept my feelings.」
Rikka
「I love you. Please... go out with me.」
％Ｂ
「I would love to.」
Rikka
「Thank you. Hehe, it's a little weird to confess while we're already dating, isn't it?」

％Ｂ
「Yeah. But it was exciting.」
Rikka
「Same for me. I was really nervous. So this is how you felt.」

Rikka
「It's very ticklish... But telling the person you love that you love them is very wonderful.」
％Ｂ
「I think so too. Narusawa... I love you.」
Rikka
「I love you too.」
She turns her gentle gaze toward me as she declares her love for me.

Mere words aren't enough for me to express the love filling my heart.
％Ｂ
「Narusawa...」
Rikka
「...?」
％Ｂ
「I... want to kiss you. I'll be taking your first kiss now.」
I tilt my head slightly so our noses won't bump into each other, and...
Rikka
「Mmmhh!?」
Her eyes go wide in surprise from the sudden kiss.
But she immediately closes her eyes and allows it to continue.
Rikka
「...Mh, chu...」
Her lips, unlike mine, are soft and squishy. I want to taste them forever.

...I didn't know kissing felt this good.
Rikka
「Mmh... Hahh...ah...」
Rikka
「You... kissed me.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah.」
Rikka
「I was able to give you my first kiss. Hehe, I'm happy you were my first...」

％Ｂ
「I'm glad you were my first kiss too.」
We both smile at each other ticklishly.
I want to keep on adding more and more firsts with Narusawa to the list from now on.

％Ｂ
「Is it all right if I start calling you Rikka instead of Narusawa?」
Rikka
「Wha...?」
％Ｂ
「It's kinda formal calling you by your last name, don't you think? And I'd like it if you could call me by my first name too.」

Rikka
「Your... first name?」
％Ｂ
「That's right, Rikka.」
Rikka
「～～～～～～!!」
Rikka
「I didn't know that being called Rikka could make me feel like this... Even though my family and Segawa-san already call me that...」

Rikka
「But I'm very happy. I think I like it when you call me that, 
Hino-kun
％Ａ-kun
.」
％Ｂ
「Not 
Hino-kun
％Ａ-kun
, but 
Ryousuke
％Ｂ
. Right, Rikka?」
Rikka
「Auh... I... like it when you call me by first name.
.. Ryousuke.

」
％Ｂ
「I love you, Rikka.」
Rikka
「
Ryousuke
％Ｂ
... I loooove you～」
Rikka
「...Mh, fh... nh... nh... Mh... Mh... mh.」
We say each other's names and kiss again.
It's a longer, more passionate kiss than before.
We peck at each other's lips and savor the taste.
Rikka
「Mmh... Chu... chu... Chu, chu... chuph... Mmchu...」

Rikka
「Hahh... amh... chu... Chu, chuh... mmchu... Hafh... Chu.」
We press our lips against each other and connect deeply.
We blush happily.
Rikka
「Mm, fh... Chu... Hahh... Afh, chu... chu... chuph.」
With the lapping of the waves continuing on around us...
We continue to kiss until our breaths run out.
