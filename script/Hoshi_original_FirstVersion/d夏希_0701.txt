I'm having Segawa help me with studying after school today.

We put our desks together in the classroom once everyone leaves and sit so we're facing each other.

％Ｂ
「So we're allowed to stay behind in the classroom even though we can't do any club or committee stuff?」

Natsuki
「We're doing it to study, after all. We could've gone to the library too, but there's lots of people there.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, I'd wanna study together with just the two of us. It's more like what a couple would do.」

Natsuki
「M...Mhm, that too...」
Kh... She's so cute...
My girlfriend's so ridiculously cute...
Natsuki
「O-Okay then. What do you want help with first?」
％Ｂ
「Right, let's get started. I think I'll start with physics first.」
Natsuki
「Pass.」
％Ｂ
「...Excuse me?」
Natsuki
「Let's go with another subject!」
％Ｂ
「Another...? Okay then, math.」
Natsuki
「Pass.」
％Ｂ
「Hold up. You can only pass once.」
Natsuki
「Where are you getting these rules from?」
％Ｂ
「I should be asking you that. Where the heck did you get a rule that says it's okay to pass? I thought you were gonna help me with studying.」

Natsuki
「I will. With geography and history and biology.」
％Ｂ
「Those are all just memorization.」
Natsuki
「I told you, didn't I? I'm only good at memorization subjects.」

％Ｂ
「Why the heck did you agree to do this, then?」
Natsuki
「Because I'd get to be with you that way...」
％Ｂ
「Hngh...」
Natsuki
「If we can't do committee work, then that means I'll be spending less time with you... I don't want that when we've only just started dating...」


％Ｂ
「...I hope you don't think I'll forgive you 'cause you're saying cute stuff like that.」

Natsuki
「...You won't?」
％Ｂ
「Of course I will, dammit...」
I'm weak and in love...
％Ｂ
「Anyway, so you're not good with the math subjects?」
Natsuki
「Yeah, pretty much. Like I said before, I can help you with strategies and stuff for the memorization subjects.」

I don't really know if there's anything to those subjects other than memorizing what's gonna be on the exams...

％Ｂ
「...Out of curiosity, how do you do on the math and sciences?」
Natsuki
「I haven't failed an exam for one yet.」
％Ｂ
「So that means you've gotten pretty close...」
Natsuki
「...Hmph...」
％Ｂ
「Come on... You're not gonna be able to do event committee work or grad-alb committee work if you slip up.」

Natsuki
「Yeah, but... but what the heck are trigonometric functions anyway? What's the point of finding angles and side lengths? Why do I need to know that to keep on living?」


％Ｂ
「...People who hate math and sciences always say stuff like that. But isn't that kinda stuff important for the angles and spacing for photography?」

Natsuki
「I can do just fine based on feel. A calculated photo isn't art.」

％Ｂ
「What are you talking about? There's a ton of art that comes from calculation. Apologize to Master da Vinci.」

Natsuki
「If it were me, I'd have taught da Vinci how important it is to do things by feel.」
％Ｂ
「What the heck kinda position do you think you're in to say that?」

％Ｂ
「Anyway, enough about da Vinci. How about English or Japanese, then?」

Natsuki
「I'm okay for those. Words are directly tied to communication, aren't they? I can just kinda do that stuff by feel.」


％Ｂ
「We're back to doing it by feel, huh.」
Natsuki
「It's important. You and I got together because we felt the same way, right?」


％Ｂ
「Hm... Well, you're right about that, but... Wait, no, why are we talking about this?」
Natsuki
「Either way, I'm bad at anything involving calculation.」
％Ｂ
「I see... So you live on instinct...」
Natsuki
「Oh, was that a compliment just now?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, it was.」
Natsuki
「Thanks!」
％Ｂ
「...Anyway, I know what's up now. Let's change tactics. I'll help you with sciences and math. And in exchange, you show me how to prepare for the memorization subjects.」


Natsuki
「So we'll both be each other's student and teach each other.」
％Ｂ
「I think it'll be better for both of us that way. Neither of us can afford to fail these exams. Let's go with that plan.」


Natsuki
「Okay, got it. I'm not an easy teacher, just so you know. I'm not going to show you any mercy, so prepare yourself.」

％Ｂ
「Bring it on. Let's start with math, then.」
Natsuki
「W-Wait... We're starting with you...?」
％Ｂ
「I'm not gonna show you any mercy, so prepare yourself.」

『It is almost time to leave the school. Students that have remained behind for club or committee activities, please bring your activities to a close and begin preparing to go home. To repeat―』


％Ｂ
「Hm... Time to leave already. Time really flies when you're focused.」
Natsuki
「Sine, cosine, tangent... x and y... parabolic arc is... the angle...」

％Ｂ
「Let's start on our way home.」
Natsuki
「...Gasp! I'll finally be free from this mathematical hell...」

％Ｂ
「You're so melodramatic. Anyway, we went over trigonometric functions today. You better remember them, all right?」

Natsuki
「I will if my brain doesn't reject them...」
％Ｂ
「It's easier to get things to stick in your head if you do the same problems again once you get home.」
Natsuki
「...I think I'm about to have a fever...」
Judging from her face, she might not be lying.

I pack my notebooks and textbooks into my bag and look out toward the hallway.
There's no one here now that it's time to go home.
And we're all alone in the classroom.
I... instinctively lick my lips.
％Ｂ
「H-Hey... Segawa...」
Natsuki
「Mhm...」
I stare at her face.
She must've been thinking the same thing as I was.
We both get up from our seats at the same time and bring ourselves closer.

Natsuki
「...Mh...」
She closes her eyes and puckers her lips a little.
I glance around us, and then kiss her.
Natsuki
「Mmh... chu... nnh...」
I know there's no one around, but the thrill of knowing that someone might see us is making my heart beat like crazy.

Natsuki
「Mh...nh... Fh... nh...」
It's a bit longer of a kiss than our first.
Natsuki
「Hahh...」
Segawa looks a little dazed when we pull our lips away.
Natsuki
「That was a bit exciting... Ehehe...」
％Ｂ
「Yeah... Let's go.」
Natsuki
「Yeah!」
I think I might be okay staying behind to study like this every day.
