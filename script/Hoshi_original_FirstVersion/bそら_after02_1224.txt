Christmas Eve.
I've come by the Azuma Architectural Firm to make my season's greetings.

％Ｂ
「Thank you very much for everything this year. I'll be in your care again next year.」

Azuma
「Yeah, good work this year. Likewise for us. That science museum design competition's gonna start up as soon as the new year's here. You ready?」


％Ｂ
「Well, I have things covered on that front. I have the ultimate brain right by my side.」

Azuma
「You've got a point. This is one competition you can't let yourself lose.」

Azuma
「But listen up. This competition may be for younger... no, it's because it's for younger architects that it's going to be pretty tough, because it's going to gather up all the other talented ones who want to move upward.」


％Ｂ
「...Yes.」
Azuma
「And the city's not just playing around either. They're always interested in a "benefit." In common parlance, it's about whether they'll get customers. You're out if you're focused only on design.」


Azuma
「Going further, this new science museum's going to become a new landmark in Shionagi, so they're going to put emphasis on the designer's name.」


Azuma
「If there are two even submissions, they'll pick the designer who's even a little more well known. In fact, it's common for the more famous designer's submission to be picked even if their design's a bit worse.」


％Ｂ
「I'm already well aware.」
Azuma
「Oh?」
％Ｂ
「I'm currently a newbie who's only just set up his own independent firm. I might've been able to rely on the name of the Azuma Architectural Firm previously...」


％Ｂ
「But now that means I don't have anything to lose. I'll do everything I can as ％Ａ ％Ｂ, and give it all that I have.」

Azuma
「So what you're saying is you're prepared. All right. I'll be looking forward to what you submit, then.」

％Ｂ
「Yes! Please do!」
all
I leave Azuma-san's firm and immediately head to the science museum.
Because today's the first day for Sora's new planetarium show to air.

I went to the first day's first showing of the "Tale of the Moon" before.
I decided I'd go to the first showing of "A History of Shooting Stars" this time too.

％Ｂ
「Looks like I made it. Now then...」
I buy a ticket and sit in my assigned seat.
The schools in the area have started winter break already. The audience is mostly families or groups of children.

％Ｂ
「...」
It's about to start.
Sora appears in her usual spot as navigator.
She immediately glances my way. She must've expected me to come.
％Ｂ
「...」
Sora
「...*nod*」
Our eyes meet. She smiles confidently and gives a small nod.

％Ｂ
「...Okay.」
I'm glad. It looks like she isn't too nervous.
The lights go out, and the audience goes quiet.
The children ooh and aah as the stars glimmer into visibility on the ceiling.

Sora
「...Meteors... Shooting stars... A grand celestial show that space puts on for us on occasion.」

Sora
「...All who have seen the stars streak and fall through the skies feel excitement as their hearts are stolen away by the sight.」

Sora
「For today's show, we will be unraveling the history of those meteors.」

Sora
「Now then, let's first have a show. A show of stars, brought to you by space itself...!」

A single shooting star streaks across the screen.
More and more steadily begin to appear.
And of course, I can hear adults go "Ohh..." and kids cry out in appreciation from the audience.

Sora
「...What you are watching now is the Perseid meteor shower, commonly seen on summer nights. The Perseid meteor shower is one of the three great meteor showers, and appears most often from the end of July to the end of August.」


Sora
「The three great meteor showers are the Perseids, the Quadrantids, and the Geminids.」

Sora
「...Now then, meteor showers come in many different sizes. At times one can only see a scant few in an hour, and at other times, too many may rain down to possibly count.」


Sora
「The meteor shower which rained down in Japan in 1992 would have looked like this.」

Even more stars start moving across the screen above our heads.

Sora
「There were over one hundred stars in an hour seen back then. This is known as a meteor swarm. I am sure everyone present was shocked to see the genuine swarm of stars moving through the skies.」


Sora
「But, there are times when meteor showers are even more impressive than this. One could perhaps think of these as a prank played on us by space.」

Sora
「By the way, everyone, what do we call it when rain and wind grow stronger and more violent?」

Grade-School Boy A
「A hurricane!」
Sora
「Oh, you're very close.」
Grade-School Girl A
「A storm!」
Sora
「That's correct. Yes, we call those rough weather phenomena storms. Now then, let us gaze upon a rain of stars that surpasses even that of a meteor swarm. A meteor storm.」


The number of meteors steadily increases, until there's an absurd quantity raining down over the audience.

Sora
「...This is the Draconid meteor shower which was seen over America in the year 1946. Next...」

The number of meteors swells further.
Sora
「The Leonid meteor shower in America, 1833, a veritable storm of stars... This is a meteor storm. It was said that there were 50,000 meteors seen within an hour at this time.」


Sora
「However... There are historical accounts of even greater meteor storms. What must people have thought at the time when seeing these meteor storms?」


Sora
「Please, put yourselves in their shoes and watch. This is the Leonid meteor shower which was seen over Venezuela in the year 1799. With over one million shooting stars in one hour―」


The screen overhead fills almost entirely with bright streaks of light.
Grade-School Boy A
「Woooooooowwww! This is awesoooomeee!」
Grade-School Girl A
「It's so prettyyy! Woooow!!」
Everyone's yelling out loud with excitement.
％Ｂ
「Oohh... Ohhh! Whoaahh!」
I can't help but cry out myself.
It's even more amazing than the first time I saw a meteor.
I'm sure everyone in the audience has their eyes wide open with childlike wonder right now.

Sora
「Stars can grant wishes. Seeing many shooting stars is sure to grant that many more wishes.」


That phrase is...
I look at Sora while everyone's looking overhead.
Sora's already looking at me, as if she knew I would look at her. She smiles.

That's right. It's what she said all those years ago, in our homemade planetarium for the Tanabata Festival...

Sora
「...I wish for all of your wishes to come true.」
Grade-School Boy A
「That was so cool!」
Grade-School Girl A
「There were lots of shooting stars, so lots of wishes will come true!」

％Ｂ
「...」
The kids still seem endlessly excited as they leave the showing area.

But the show isn't over yet.
Everyone gets a small bag at the exit.
Grade-School Boy A
「What's thiiis?」
Grade-School Girl A
「Sh, Shoot, ing, star, chil, dren... Shooting Star Children?」
Grade-School Boy A
「Awesome! There's rocks shaped like stars inside!」
Grade-School Girl A
「It's really the kids of shooting stars! They're so cute!」
The kids leave the showing area, happily clutching the vials of star sand.

I head back toward my firm, gazing at my own vial of star sand.
But I stop walking when someone calls out for me from behind.
I turn around...
Sora
「...Ryou!」
Sora
「...Wait!」
％Ｂ
「Oh? Huh? Wait, Sora? What about work??」
Sora
「...Mmh!」
She runs over and throws her arms around me again.
Sora
「I'm taking a break because I wanted to chase after you.」
Sora
「I got them to let me take a break so I could chase after you.」
％Ｂ
「O-Oh, okay...」
Sora
「...How did the audience like it?」
％Ｂ
「It was amazing this time too. In fact, I think it was even better this time. Even I was yelling because I was so excited.」

Sora
「...What about the souvenirs?」
％Ｂ
「They liked those too. They seemed to like the "Shooting Star Children" name. The kids especially liked it.」

Sora
「...Really?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. It's another huge success.」
Sora
「...I'm so glad.」
％Ｂ
「So then you'll be in charge of the planetarium for sure now?」
Sora
「...I was told that it'd probably be okay leaving it to me after the show. The formal appointment will be a little later on.」

％Ｂ
「Really? That's great, Sora!」
Sora
「...Thank you.」
％Ｂ
「Wow... So now you're in charge.」
Sora
「...*nod* Thank you so much.」
％Ｂ
「No, it's still too early to thank me.」
％Ｂ
「I'm gonna design the science museum that's to be reopened. It'll be my present to you for your promotion.」

Sora
「...Ryou...」
Sora
「...Oh...」
％Ｂ
「I'll win for sure.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
all
And─
And once this competition's over, I'm going to tell her for sure.
That I want to create a new future together with her.
