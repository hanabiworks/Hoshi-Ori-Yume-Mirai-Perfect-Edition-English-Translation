Sora was able to take a break from work for a decent amount of time about midway through November.

Her workplace is open regardless of weekend or weekday, so she ended up having to take off in the middle of the week, but that might've been a good thing, considering I wasn't doing anything since I was setting up the new firm.


We drive out to a hot springs inn that's apparently notable for its baths located deep in the mountains.

The open-air bath's reservable, so the two of us decide to take a bath together.

％Ｂ
「Whew... Ahh, what a great bath...」
Sora
「...You're an old man.」
％Ｂ
「...I can't help it. It just came out...」
Sora
「...That's why you're an old man.」
％Ｂ
「Uuuh...」
Sora
「...But you're right, it is a nice bath. It removes fatigue and makes my skin smooth.」

％Ｂ
「This place is kind of a secret that's never really come up on TV or anything. The owner of the inn apparently declines all coverage requests because he doesn't like stuff like that.」


Sora
「...How'd you find it?」
％Ｂ
「Teacher told me. He said there was a hot springs inn with a nice feel deep in the mountains. He apparently found it by chance when he was traveling around the country back when he was young.」


％Ｂ
「He said the stars were really pretty here because it was up in the mountains. So I've always wanted to come here. And yeah, he's definitely right.」

Sora
「...*nod*」
The heavens shine brightly above us.
％Ｂ
「Ahh... This is great. I've been running around all over the place lately 'cause of the firm stuff, so it's amazing to get to relax like this for once.」


％Ｂ
「Getting to stretch your legs out in the bath's great. You just can't do this in an apartment bath.」

I dimly look up at the night sky while enjoying the bath.
There's a pretty full moon up there along with the stars.
％Ｂ
「The moon... Now that I think about it, the moon was the first thing you ever showed me through your telescope.」

Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「I remember I was so excited back then when I got to see the craters up close... I can still remember how emotional I got. I don't think I'll ever forget.」


Sora
「...Craters are depressions formed from impacts from asteroids or comets. Some theories say that they also might be the remnants of volcanic activity.」

％Ｂ
「Oh...」
Sora
「The moon's diameter is 3,474 kilometers. The fifth biggest satellite in the solar system. It's 384,400 kilometers away from Earth─」







Sora
「...Its gravity is approximately a sixth of Earth's. 110 degrees centigrade by day, -170 by night. One day on the moon is twenty-nine days on Earth.」


％Ｂ
「Ohh... Man, that takes me back. I remember you gave me the same talk back then too.」

Sora
「...You called craters bumps.」
Sora
「...You called craters bumps.」
％Ｂ
「That's right. And your explanations were always blunt and straight to the point like that back then.」

Sora
「...It's still easier to explain like this. It's different when I do the narration at work though.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, Ritsu-sensei'd get mad at you if you talked like you did just now at work.」
Sora
「...That was terrifying... but I'm grateful to Ritsu.」

％Ｂ
「Speaking of which, does the planetarium ever do shows about the moon?」

Sora
「...Not much recently. If we do, it's for a little bit during an eclipse. Space exploration, distant planets, and constellations are always more popular.」


％Ｂ
「Really... That's a shame. The moon's one of my favorites.」

Sora
「...Is it?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. Though it's 'cause it was the first thing you ever showed me.」

Sora
「...Want me to talk more about the moon, then?」
％Ｂ
「Oh, I like that idea. Yeah, that'd be great.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
That's right... This moon was the first thing Sora ever talked to me about.
She's told me things about lots of different things in the night sky since then.
About constellations, planets, outer space...
And at the same time, about herself.
So much has happened in the ten years I've been together with Sora.\n \n\r
We've exchanged words, confirmed our feelings for each other, shared our warmth, acknowledged, praised, comforted, and supported one another.

We had fights too.
But we would always apologize at the same time when those happened.
And we'd always smile and laugh at the same time too.
We've remained close all this time as we've made each other's dreams come true.
And we're going to keep walking side by side...\n\r
We both know that. There's no need for us to put it into words.
Sora
「...Want me to talk about the moon more?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah... Please do.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
Now that I've moved onto a new stage of my career, I need to pull myself together more than ever before.

And I'll become a partner to her for the rest of her life, in the truest meaning of the word.
