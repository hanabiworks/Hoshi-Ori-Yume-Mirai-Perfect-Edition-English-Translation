I head to the old school building immediately after classes end.
Oh good, she's here.
She's in her usual spot, resting her chin in her hands.
She looks at me once she notices me.
Touko
「Oh, it's you. Welcome. It's been a while.」
％Ｂ
「I've been busy with preparing stuff, 'cause Okihara-senpai and Ousaka said they'd participate in the Tanabata Festival after we went camping.」

Touko
「Ohh, well congrats. Really, so Fluffyhead and Jellyfish-senpai said they'd participate.」
％Ｂ
「Fluffyhead...」
I guess by process of elimination, that must be Ousaka.
Piano-chan, Camera-chan, Fluffyhead... She sure is straight to the point.
％Ｂ
「So anyway, I came here to ask you for a favor.」
Touko
「What might that be? I'll at least hear you out.」
％Ｂ
「It's about the Tanabata Festival. We don't have enough people.」
Touko
「You mean you want me to join your committee to help? Sorry, but I don't like being restricted like that.」

％Ｂ
「It'd be fine if you just came to help whenever you felt like it. Of course, there's an upside for you too.」

Touko
「Uh huh, like what?」
％Ｂ
「You said you wanted me to do something about the clubs trying to recruit you, didn't you? I can make that pretty much go away.」

Touko
「Hmm. Well, that does sound attractive. How?」
％Ｂ
「If you're with us, you can camouflage yourself as a member of our committee.」

％Ｂ
「You're getting a lot of invites 'cause you're not currently in any clubs, right? The number of invites should go down by a lot if they think you're in the committee.」

％Ｂ
「And of course, I'll put in my fair share of effort to make sure the truth doesn't get out.」
Touko
「I seeee. You're right, this does sound like it has its upsides for me. Mmm, but still...」


％Ｂ
「If you don't wanna actually help, then you can just come and hang out.」
Touko
「But then that wouldn't help you guys out in any way, would it?」
％Ｂ
「We made a deal that you'd bring us rice in exchange for me doing something about all that recruitment.」

％Ｂ
「So this is just something extra I'm asking for, only when you feel like it.」

Touko
「Mmm... I thought the same thing back when you asked for the rice, but the way you ask people to do things is kinda unfair.」
％Ｂ
「Uh... What do you mean?」
Touko
「No, it's nothing. Okay, I'll come and play sometimes.」
％Ｂ
「That's enough for me. Later then.」
Touko
「Mm, bye-bye.」
all
％Ｂ
「Phew... I got a little too focused.」
I was looking stuff up in the library, and before I knew it, it was almost time to go home.

I was doing research on what the naturalist and astronomy clubs should do for the Tanabata Festival.
What we can do that fulfills Okihara-senpai's and Ousaka's wishes that's also practical.

My smartphone's enough for general stuff, but if I really wanna get down in the weeds to do research, then I've gotta rely on books.

％Ｂ
「But I think I'll be able to nail it down sometime this week, which is good.」
All that's left to do is see what Okihara-senpai and Ousaka think of what I present to them.

To be honest, I don't really mind if they shoot down my proposal.
Of course, I put a lot of work into this, so it'd be great if they liked it.

What's important is that we all work together to make something great.
％Ｂ
「This might kinda be like architecture, thinking about it.」
The client and the architect combine lots of ideas and opinions to create a design together. 

Skilled professionals put a building together based on that design.
Just like the Mr. Azuma I respect so much does.
％Ｂ
「I'm gonna make something that won't lose to him.」
I pause in front of the second music classroom.
It's become a daily routine for me to check if Narusawa's inside.
％Ｂ
「Oh...!」
_00cutinBS
She's here again today.
But unlike usual, she isn't playing piano.
She's reading a slender book with a pretty-looking binding.
_00cutinBS
％Ｂ
「Yo, Narusawa.」
Rikka
「...!」
She looks incredibly shocked to see me.
％Ｂ
「My bad. Did I scare you?」
Rikka
「No, not really...」
I catch a glimpse of the contents of the book she was reading. Rows of five horizontal lines, with music notes along the rows.

The title reads "A Fragment of Emotion."
％Ｂ
「Is that sheet music?」
Rikka
「Yes, it is.」
％Ｂ
「"A Fragment of Emotion"? As in...?」
Rikka
「Yes, the theme song for Shionagi's Tanabata Festival that my mom composed.」
％Ｂ
「So you can play that? Can I hear it?」
Rikka
「I... can't play this.」
％Ｂ
「What? Really?」
That's a bit unexpected.
％Ｂ
「So there are songs you can't play? You're so good at piano, too.」
Rikka
「Of course there are. Liszt has particularly difficult pieces, and it took me a long time before I could play them.」

Rikka
「But this is different. This is for a primo and secondo. It's a piano four hands arrangement.」

％Ｂ
「You mean when two people play the same piano?」
Rikka
「That's what that means.」
％Ｂ
「Really now... Wait, but I don't remember "A Fragment of Emotion" being played that way.」
In my head, I've only ever imagined that piece being played by one person.
Rikka
「This sheet music is special.」
％Ｂ
「...Special?」
all
She silently closes the sheet music case, and places it inside her bag.
Rikka
「I'll be leaving, then.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, could you wait a bit, then? I'm going back to the committee room to get my stuff right now.」

％Ｂ
「Let's go home together. I'll walk you home.」
Rikka
「I'm fine by myself.」
I already expected that response.
I guess I've gotten to understand her a little more.
％Ｂ
「I'd be lonely by myself. Going home should be fun, right?」

Rikka
「What about Shinozaki-san? She lives near you, doesn't she?」
％Ｂ
「She went home already.」
I had her go home before me because I wanted to go to the library.
Rikka
「So you'd like for me to distract you from your loneliness in Shinozaki-san's place.」
％Ｂ
「Not in Shinozaki's place. I wanna go home with you.」
all
％Ｂ
「So anyway, I'll be right back!」
Rikka
「Wha... Oh!」
Rikka
「...He's gone. Even though I never said I'd go home with him.」
all
Rikka
「How forceful to leave without even waiting for my answer. You couldn't have blamed me if I had left.」

％Ｂ
「If that had happened, yeah. But you were right there waiting for me.」

Rikka
「I thought I should at least complain. I'll go home without you if you do that to me again.」

％Ｂ
「All right, I'll make sure I ask you properly first.」
Rikka
「You say that like it's a given that I'll say yes.」
％Ｂ
「Isn't it normal to say yes?」
Rikka
「Who knows. I'd say no right away if I didn't want to.」
％Ｂ
「Haha, I see. Then that's good.」
Looks like she didn't not want me to walk her home, at least.
Rikka
「That button... You should replace that soon. It doesn't look good.」
She's looking at the button on my chest.
The one that she replaced for me yesterday.
％Ｂ
「But it made me happy. I've never had a girl do something like this for me before.」

％Ｂ
「So I was thinking I'd just keep it this way.」
Rikka
「...You really are strange.」
Her expression seems gentle.
