Natsuki
「Morniiing!」
％Ｂ
「Hey, morning.」
A lively voice greets me as I walk into the classroom after parting ways with Shinozaki.
Natsuki
「Yesterday was so much fun! I got lots of photos too, so I'm totally satisfied!」

％Ｂ
「That's great. It was a ton of fun for me too.」
Natsuki
「I decided to print them out right away. Here, look.」
She casually spreads a bunch of photos out on my desk.
The photos are filled with us just doing whatever, with lots of smiles.

％Ｂ
「Oh, these came out great!」
Natsuki
「Of course they did. Just who do you think I am?」
％Ｂ
「A respectable member of the grad-alb committee, of course.」
Natsuki
「I was going to give these to Marika and the others later, but do you want any?」

％Ｂ
「Let's see...」
all
I randomly sift through the stack of photos.
％Ｂ
「I feel like most of these photos are of the girls.」
Natsuki
「Don't you think taking photos of cute girls is more worthwhile than taking photos of guys?」
％Ｂ
「Can't argue with that. But... these photos are kinda weird now that I'm getting a good look at them...」

Natsuki
「How rude. How are they weird?」
％Ｂ
「What do you mean, "how"...?」
There are some shots peeking at armpits, focusing on sweaty cleavage, close-ups on the nape of the neck...

They're all really good photos, but I feel like they're weirdly fetishistic...

Maybe it's just me?
Natsuki
「Just look at this photo! Look at the juices from the meat, dripping from Misa-san's mouth! Just can't get enough～」

％Ｂ
「Ahh～ ...So the cameraman's to blame after all.」
all
The photo shows Okihara-senpai biting into a skewer of grilled meat.
I guess it speaks to Segawa's ability as a photographer that a scene so simple seems so alluring.

That's what I've decided. I'm not the perverted one here. Not at all.
％Ｂ
「Oh...」
I pick up one of the photos.
It's of Narusawa smiling.
I can't help but stare at it.
It reminds me of how she was enjoying herself yesterday, and it makes me feel a bit ticklish.
Natsuki
「You've got good taste there, mister! Isn't that a cute one? That's one of the ones I'm proudest of, you know.」

Segawa's face is right next to mine.
I freeze in shock from how close it is.
Natsuki
「What's this～? Would you like that one, mister?」
％Ｂ
「It isn't anything weird. It's just...」
Natsuki
「Just?」
％Ｂ
「I dunno... Sorry, I don't really get it myself.」
all
This strange, inexplicable feeling.
Seeing Narusawa smile makes me happy.
I want to see her smile more...
Thoughts like that seep into my mind.
％Ｂ
「Then could I have these ones?」
I pick out a few of the photos with all of us together.
Natsuki
「Sure thing. And here, take this one too.」
She holds out the photo of Narusawa.
％Ｂ
「...May I ask what you're planning?」
Natsuki
「I'm not planning anything. I just thought you should be the one to have this photo.」

Natsuki
「'Cause you're the one who was responsible for creating this smile yesterday.」

I got Narusawa to...
That wasn't my intention, but...
％Ｂ
「If you say so, Segawa. I'll gratefully accept it, then.」
all
I accept the photo of Narusawa, carefully place it in a folder, and stow the folder away in my bag.
％Ｂ
「Oh.」
Narusawa walks into the classroom right before the bell rings.
all
She walks to her seat and silently places her bag down.
％Ｂ
「Morning, Narusawa.」
Rikka
「Good morning.」
She doesn't smile, but her tone sounds a little softer compared to what it was like last week.
I'm glad I invited her along.
Rikka
「...What. Don't grin at other people like that.」
％Ｂ
「Huh? Oh, was I doing that? Haha, sorry, it's nothing.」
Rikka
「...Well, whatever.」
all
She sits down and starts preparing for class.
I wonder why I feel so excited.
The week's beginning... I feel like this week's going to be even more fun than the last.
I just hope things change on Okihara-senpai and Ousaka's front too...
Misa
「I look forward to working with you.」
Senpai hands me an envelope after school.
I look inside to see...
％Ｂ
「This is... for the Tanabata Festival...」
It's a participation form for the Tanabata Festival, with all the blanks neatly filled in.

Misa
「I have already checked through it once, but please look through it to make sure there is nothing lacking.」

％Ｂ
「Uh, oh, yes. You've filled out all of the necessary blanks, so there don't seem to be any issues...」
all
Sora
「I filled mine out too. Any mistakes?」
She also hands me her participation form.
No issues here either.
％Ｂ
「Nope, no mistakes.」
all
What do I do? ...I'm so happy I can't find the words to express myself.
Marika
「Isn't this great?」
％Ｂ
「Y-Yeah...」
all
Misa
「We apologize for forcing you to wait.」
Sora
「I met and talked with Misa this morning. About what to do.」
Misa
「Fufu, and it seems that both of us had more or less arrived at the same conclusion separately.」

Sora
「The camping was powerful.」
Misa
「Yes, I agree. The camping trip was so fun it made the choice very easy.」

Misa
「To be honest, we have yet to decide what we will be doing. But...」

Misa
「I also wish to make many people happy! Just like you two did for us!」

％Ｂ
「Okihara-senpai...」
Sora
「Will everyone smile like when we were camping?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. Let's do our best to make that happen.」
Misa
「May we ask the two of you to lend us your aid?」
％Ｂ
「Of course! We'll support you any way we can!」
Marika
「Yeah! Let's make this a wonderful Tanabata Festival!」
Misa
「Yes! I look forward to working with you!」
Sora
「Likewise.」
When I see Okihara-senpai's and Ousaka's smiles, I know.
This is all thanks to our hard work.
I'm just so happy that they've come to us saying that they want to participate.

％Ｂ
「Then forgive me for jumping the gun, but is there anything you would like to do?」
Misa
「I've only just decided on participating at all, so I haven't thought about it...」
Sora
「Same.」
Looks like neither of them has any concrete ideas yet.
％Ｂ
「There's no point in rushing these things, so let's think it over carefully.」

％Ｂ
「We'll try thinking of ideas, so could you two please do the same?」

Sora
「Got it.」
Misa
「Yes, I will. When should we reconvene?」
％Ｂ
「Let's see... Tomorrow might be a bit too soon. How about after school the day after tomorrow?」

Sora
「No problem.」
Misa
「That would be fine with me as well.」
％Ｂ
「Let's do that, then.」
all
Marika
「Looks like things are going to get busy soon.」
％Ｂ
「Sure does.」
all
％Ｂ
「God, that guy's just so callous about using people...」
We went to go talk to Shuuichi in high spirits to turn in Okihara-senpai's and Ousaka's participation forms, and then...

He claimed he was happy too, and then immediately put us to another task.
％Ｂ
「I've put a stop to two of the hangouts so far.」
There are apparently always some groups who submit participation forms under various pretenses, create something mediocre, and just use it as a hangout area.

It'd be one thing if all they did was just sit around, but there have apparently been cases where the "hanging out" involved some pretty obscene activities.

％Ｂ
「At school? Seriously? Man, that's some real living on the edge.」
It's a dream situation for a school-age guy.
Though it's not like I actually have the opportunity to do something like that. I don't even have a girlfriend...
I want one, of course.
But I don't just want a girlfriend just to have one, you know?

％Ｂ
「I wonder if it's the kinda thing you can just get right away.」
％Ｂ
「I guess people say romance is all about action. There's the chance I'll never get a girlfriend if I don't make a move myself...」

％Ｂ
「No, come on, even Shuuichi's got one! I'll get one too someday!」
％Ｂ
「...I'll be assertive once there's someone I like.」
I think it'd be nice if I made moves myself and got a girl to notice me, and got her to like me that way.

％Ｂ
「Phew... I should stop thinking about stupid stuff and go report my progress already.」
％Ｂ
「Oh...」
I can hear something from further down the hall...
From the second music classroom.
I turn the corner, enticed by the melody...
To find Narusawa playing piano alone again.
There's no one else here in this room.
It seems strangely lonely to me.
It might just be because she seemed like she was having a bit of fun with everyone else when we went camping.

Rikka
「It does, hehe...」
The smile she showed me without warning back when the two of us ended up getting soaked together.

Rikka
「Hey
, Hino-kun

...」
Rikka
「Thank you.」
That dazzling smile, completely at odds with how she usually comes across.
It's still burnt into the back of my mind.
Her slender, pretty fingers strike against the keys.
Thump...
My heart leaps.
It's like she's playing me with those keys...
％Ｂ
「Aghh～ ...I feel weird.」
I'm feeling a strange mixture of comfort and discomfort.
Why am I feeling this way?
％Ｂ
「Maybe... I like Narusawa?」
No, wait, come on! It hasn't even been that long since we first met!
I know they say love knows no boundaries, but that's gotta be way too shallow of me, right?

We just sit next to each other, and not much else.
There's hardly enough for me to fall for her even in a shallow way.
I must be thinking stuff like this because I was only just thinking about how I want a girlfriend...

But...
I can't deny that I think about her.
I have absolutely no idea if these feelings are love, friendship, or just nosiness...

But I want to see Narusawa smiling together with everyone else again.
It'd be nice if we could all have fun together again...
I really think so, from the bottom of my heart.
Narusawa stops playing when she hears me open the door.
％Ｂ
「Yo.」
Rikka
「You again? I told you already that I'm not in any clubs.」

％Ｂ
「No, I didn't come for any attendance stuff today.」
％Ｂ
「Can we talk for a bit?」
Rikka
「Sure, I don't mind. Do you need something?」
％Ｂ
「It's not like I really need anything important...」
Rikka
「What? Don't be so vague.」
It's freakin' hard to say it, all right!?
％Ｂ
「Hahh... Suuh... Hahh...」
I take some deep breaths to steel myself.
％Ｂ
「I told you already that I'm in the event committee now, right?」
Rikka
「You did. And Shinozaki-san too.」
％Ｂ
「So... Why don't you join the committee too?」
Rikka
「...Me? Why?」
She looks at me somewhat suspiciously.
But I'm just glad she didn't immediately say no.
％Ｂ
「Is "because I want you to" not good enough?」
Rikka
「It isn't. That's not a legitimate reason. It doesn't tell me anything about why you want me to join.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, I figured...」
But it's not like I could make up some dumb lie like we don't have enough people, 'cause she'd see through that immediately.

And lying to her just to get her to join in the first place would be an awful thing to do.
Rikka
「...Is it because I'm alone?」
％Ｂ
「Huh?」
Rikka
「...」
She seems confident in her guess.
She's totally seen through me.
Rikka
「Do I look that pitiful to you? Do I look miserable? Do I look lonely to you?」

％Ｂ
「No, that's not...」
Rikka
「I've never considered myself lonely. I'm here like this because I want to be alone.」

％Ｂ
「...」
％Ｂ
「Sorry. It looks like I've rubbed you the wrong way. How do I say this...?」
％Ｂ
「It's like you say, I thought you looked lonely at first. But that's not exactly right either.」

％Ｂ
「I feel like you're always kinda stiff, or kinda tense...」
Rikka
「...!」
％Ｂ
「I know it's none of my business. It must just be the way I am. But I can't stop thinking about it.」

Rikka
「You're right, it isn't any of your business.」
％Ｂ
「Haha, pretty blunt, eh?」
Rikka
「Perhaps I should've said it in a more roundabout way?」
％Ｂ
「No, that'd be...」
If she had been painfully indirect about it...
...Yeah, that'd have been worse.
％Ｂ
「Truth is, Okihara-senpai and Ousaka both said they're gonna participate in the Tanabata Festival earlier.」

Rikka
「Well that's good. Looks like the camping trip paid off.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. And I got one more thing out of it too.」
Rikka
「What?」
％Ｂ
「I got to see you camping yesterday. I know we kinda ended up forcing you to come, but it looked like you were having fun, and seeing that made things fun for me.」


Rikka
「...Why does me having fun make things fun for you?」
％Ｂ
「No idea. Who knows.」
I'm sure it speaks to how I feel about Narusawa in some way.
But I'm not sure myself exactly what it means.
％Ｂ
「Either way, it was just fun. I want you to smile more. I want to see your smile more.」

％Ｂ
「It made me think that I wanted to do more fun stuff with you and everyone else, so I can see us all smile together.」

Rikka
「Uh... ghh... I can't believe you can say something that embarrassing...」
％Ｂ
「I'm pretty embarrassed about it myself. But I'm honest about asking you to join, so it's not like I'm gonna lie or dress up my words.」


I just want her to understand how I feel.
Rikka
「I understand that you're sincere. Though it's completely just you being selfish.」
％Ｂ
「I already know I'm being pushy. But that won't change how I feel about things.」
Rikka
「You don't look like you'd be this forceful. But I'm...」
％Ｂ
「Couldn't you consider it just a little? Just a tiny bit.」
Rikka
「I doubt my answer would change.」
％Ｂ
「That's fine. I just want you to think about it.」
Rikka
「...Fine, I get it. I'll think about it. Don't expect anything more.」
％Ｂ
「Thanks.」
％Ｂ
「I'm gonna go, then. Sorry for bothering you.」
The clear melody starts up again a bit after I close the door.
％Ｂ
「She didn't say no, so I guess there's still a chance?」
I head toward the committee room in high spirits, humming the same melody to myself as I go.
