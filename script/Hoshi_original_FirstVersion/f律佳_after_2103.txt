「Oh... Crap!」
I give a start when I see the time.
It's a little past when I'm supposed to leave.
I must've gotten too focused on work.
I hurriedly pack away the materials I have out on my desk.
Azuma
「Oh, well aren't you in a hurry. Rikka-chan again today?」
％Ｂ
「Yes. We're supposed to meet up to pick out a wedding ring together.」
Azuma
「That sure sounds wonderful. Go on then.」
％Ｂ
「I'm sorry for leaving while everyone else is working so hard...」
Azuma
「I can't believe I'm hearing this from the guy who'd just waltz in to drink tea here back in high school, even after I rejected him in an interview.」
He rubs his chin and grins.
Azuma
「Well, in my experience at least, people who can only work don't do well in life.」
Azuma
「What I'm saying is that having a fulfilling private life expands your horizons, and that tends to help out a lot with work too... Whoops, looks like there are some people I shouldn't be saying stuff like this around, heheh.」
Firm Staff A
「Just so you know, Chief, it's not that I don't want to get married. I just don't have anyone to marry～」

all
％Ｂ
「Oh, I'm sorry! I really need to get going...! Thank you very much for today! Please excuse me!」
Firm Staff A & Firm Staff B
「Good work todaaay!」
I head to our meet-up spot to find Rikka sitting on a nearby bench.
％Ｂ
「Sorry, did I make you wait a while?」
Rikka
「No, not too long. But... lots of people were looking at me and trying to talk to me. I didn't really know what I should do.」
％Ｂ
「Wha!? Kh, who!? Who the hell's hitting on my precious Rikka!?」

Rikka
「Hehe, no. See, over there...」
all
She points to a ticket center in the corner.
There's a giant poster up with the words "Narusawa Rikka Recital" dancing across it.
％Ｂ
「Right, they're doing seating reservations already.」
The poster's to advertise Rikka's recital in July.
Rikka
「People looked back and forth between my face on the poster and in real life, or came up to tell me they'd come see the recital, and asked me for autographs... Uuh, it was so embarrassing...」

％Ｂ
「You're real popular. The Angel of Piano.」
Rikka
「Aah, uuuh... Don't call me that.」
Rikka occasionally appears on music programs.
Her incredible performances and her good looks have garnered her a pretty passionate fanbase.

I dunno who came up with it first, but she's been nicknamed "The Angel of Piano."
％Ｂ
「You've gotten an offer to be in a documentary show too, right? What are you gonna do about that?」

Rikka
「Mmm～ ...I like the show itself, but I don't really know if I actually want to have a role. The director said he wanted my husband to be in it too.」
％Ｂ
「Wha, me!?」
Rikka
「Mhm... Because the theme of that program is showcasing what makes the person appealing, and their human side. He apparently wants to film our private life.」
％Ｂ
「But I'm just a no-name architect-in-training, and an amateur actor. I'm not gonna add anything to the show.」

Rikka
「I think it should be fine to just act normal. Will you be in it with me? It'd be reassuring for me if you were there too.」

％Ｂ
「Well, I'd love to if it means I get to help you out with your work even a little.」

Rikka
「Thank you. I'll tell him I'm interested, then.」
％Ｂ
「So it's finally my time to shine on national television. I think I'll start practicing a cool introduction and a trademark pose or something.」
Rikka
「Hehe, geez... Don't do anything too embarrassing, okay?」
She links arms with me.
Rikka
「Ehehe. I wonder what kind of wedding ring we should get. I'm looking forward to picking one. Let's go.」
％Ｂ
「Hmmh～」
We peer in at the jeweler's showcase display.
Jeweler's Employee
「Welcome. What are you looking for today? Please allow me to offer my assistance, if you require it.」
A graceful-looking woman in a slim-fit suit comes out from the back.
Jeweler's Employee
「Oh... You're... Thank you very much for your patronage back then.」
Rikka
「Do you know her?」
％Ｂ
「Wha? ...Hmm? Oh, from back when I bought the engagement ring.」
Jeweler's Employee
「Yes, fufu. It seems everything went well. Congratulations.」

She's smiling at Rikka's left ring finger.
％Ｂ
「She gave me advice about giving the ring to you.」
Jeweler's Employee
「Your girlfriend is very lucky to have you.」
Rikka
「What?」
Jeweler's Employee
「He spent about three hours thinking over which one would look the best. He said it was difficult because they all seemed like they would suit you.」
Rikka
「...」
She touches her ring tenderly.
％Ｂ
「I apologize for staying in the store for so long that day. And she isn't my girlfriend... She's... my wife now.」

Rikka
「Au, uh...」
She always goes red when I introduce her as my wife. Looks like it's still embarrassing for her.
Rikka
「I'm his wife, Rikka. Um... Thank you very much for... helping my... h-husband.」
Jeweler's Employee
「Oh no, congratulations on your marriage. And so today's business is...?」
all
We tell her about how we're legally married, but still haven't held a ceremony, and came today to find a ring for it.
The employee guides us to one of the store sections, pulls out several rings from the showcase, and generously describes them for us.
She then bows and walks away, leaving the two of us alone.
％Ｂ
「I see... So they cost around this much. There's a pretty big range. Hmm～」
Rikka
「Are you trying to buy an expensive one?」
％Ｂ
「Wouldn't that be better, since it's a once-in-a-lifetime thing?」
Rikka
「I feel bad saying this at the store, but to be honest, I'd be fine even if it were a toy ring. Anything's fine, as long as it's proof that we're married.」
Rikka
「And... we'll need money for a lot of things from now on, won't we? ...Um, like if we had a baby...」
％Ｂ
「Y-Yeah, that's true...」
％Ｂ
「Then I guess we shouldn't break the bank too much. But we'll still want it to last, so platinum, I guess?」
According to what the store employee said, silver's less durable and more malleable than platinum.
A pair of platinum rings is easily within our budget, as long as we don't get diamond-encrusted ones or something.

％Ｂ
「What kinda design do you want?」
Rikka
「I'd want something simple, since I'd be wearing it all the time.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, I like it that way too. If we could get ones with a classy kinda design, like just a little flair...」
％Ｂ
「How about this one?」
Rikka
「It's... like a musical staff.」
It's a platinum ring engraved with five sinuous lines.
Rikka's right. It does look like a musical staff.
A blank staff, with no notes written in.
Rikka
「We could engrave notes on here, one by one...」
％Ｂ
「We could engrave notes on here, one by one...」
Rikka
「...What?」
％Ｂ
「...Hm?」
Rikka
「Hehehehehe... It looks like we were thinking the same thing.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. Looks like this is the one.」
We buy the rings and leave the store.
I can't wait to place one on Rikka's finger.
％Ｂ
「It's starting to get a little less chilly at night.」
Rikka
「You're right. It's almost spring, after all.」
％Ｂ
「Wanna walk around a bit on the way home? Since we're out anyway.」
We walk to the Shionagi Culture Hall, on the seashore.
This is where Rikka's recital is going to be in the summer.
Rikka
「I wonder if lots of people will come.」
％Ｂ
「Maybe more than can fit in the main hall.」
Rikka
「Hehe, you're exaggerating. But... It'd be nice if that many could come.」

％Ｂ
「I'm sure it'll happen.」
I squeeze her hand tight.
Rikka
「Mhm.」
