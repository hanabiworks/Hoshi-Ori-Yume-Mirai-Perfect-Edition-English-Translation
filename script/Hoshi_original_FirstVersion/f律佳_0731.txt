Shuuichi
「―Hm. So no issues, then?」
％Ｂ
「None so far. We've still got a lot of last-minute adjustments to do, but we should have something close to the end product by this weekend.」

I'm reporting the Shionagi Friends' progress to Shuuichi after finishing up for the day.

％Ｂ
「It's crazy helpful to have Segawa and Yukimura helping out when they aren't even in the committee.」

Shuuichi
「Segawa aside, it'd be great if Yukimura could just keep going like this and join the committee...」

％Ｂ
「I doubt that'll happen. Yukimura probably wouldn't wanna be a part of any kind of organization or whatever.」

She probably values her freedom too much for that.

The Shionagi Friends is just another one of the things she likes.
But that doesn't mean she's irresponsible either.
She's a real mystery.

Ishizuka
「Great work today!」
Rikka
「Yes, you too. Oh...」
I catch Rikka's eye as she comes back from working with the concert team.
Rikka
「Ehehe.」
％Ｂ
「Haha.」
We both laugh at the unexpected fortune of running into each other like this.
Ishizuka
「Now, now, Narusawa-san. You can leave after we're done with our report. I understand you're happy your boyfriend's here, but it'll only be for a little longer.」

Rikka
「Ah, uh... I'm sorry.」
all
Ishizuka
「Nirasawa-kun. The concert team's work is on schedule. Stage construction begins the day after tomorrow. We'll get the equipment in on the 4th, and we'll be doing a day-before rehearsal on the 5th.」

Shuuichi
「Understood. I'm sure things will be chaotic with the contractors' vehicles and the building materials, so be careful so no accidents occur.」
Ishizuka
「I know. Anyway, that's all for the concert team today. Okay Narusawa-san, you may now be as lovey-dovey as you'd like with your boyfriend.」

Rikka
「I-I won't do that!」
Ishizuka
「You probably haven't gotten to spend much time with him with all the practicing you've been doing with Meguru-san recently, right? What if he finds another girl because he's lonely?」
Rikka
「Hehe. He's not the type to do something like that.」
She smiles as she gives an immediate response.
％Ｂ
「Besides, we always walk to and from school together. We might have less time for the two of us, but we're still enjoying ourselves.」

Ishizuka
「Oh dear... I was trying to tease her, but I ended up on the receiving end of their bragging.」

Shuuichi
「It's awful how they do it so naturally, isn't it?」
Shuuichi
「Yes, come in. The door is unlocked.」
all
Asakura
「Please excuse me.」
％Ｂ
「Oh...」
I feel like I've seen her before somewhere...
Where was it again?
Rikka
「You're Asakura-senpai, aren't you? What can we help you with today?」
Asakura
「Ohh. You're the girl who came to our class that one time. Thanks again for that.」

Asakura-senpai... Came to our class that one time...
...Right. She's an upperclassman we met when we were confirming participation for the Shio-cademy Fest.
Asakura
「I have a bit of a request today.」
Asakura
「Do you think we could participate after all?」
Rikka
「Wha... Um, that's...」
Asakura
「Our drummer who ducked out came back. She says she wants to play together with us again, one last time.」

Asakura
「I know we're in the wrong here. But would it be possible somehow?」

Asakura
「Please!!」
Asakura-senpai bows her head so hard it looks like she's about to get on her hands and knees.
Rikka
「...」
Rikka looks at her uncomfortably in silence.
Because she knows that she can't do anything for her.
It's not Rikka who says something to Asakura-senpai, but Ishizuka-san.

all
Ishizuka
「We've already finalized the program for this year, and we do not have the space to add you at this stage. We're very sorry for not being able to help you.」
Asakura
「I see... Please don't apologize. I didn't think we'd be able to anyway. Thank you very much.」

She bows her head again and leaves.
Rikka
「...」
Ishizuka
「Don't look so guilty. I wish we could do something for them too. But there's nothing we can do.」

Ishizuka
「There are always several people like that every year. We can't fulfill everyone's requests.」

Ishizuka
「You couldn't say anything because you knew that, right?」
Unlike Rikka, Ishizuka-san seems relatively unfazed.
She must have a lot more experience with things like these.
But Rikka's not used to it. It doesn't seem to be sitting too well with her.
I wish something could be done for them too, but we can't do anything if all the slots are filled...

％Ｂ
「It's like Ishizuka-san says, right? It's a shame, but it's not something you need to beat yourself up over.」

I pat her on the head to comfort her.
Rikka
「She was so serious about her request... She must really love music.」
％Ｂ
「It's the same for you, right? You'll just have to play their share of music too.」

Rikka
「Mhm... You're right.」
