「Shinozaki's a bit late.」
We're supposed to meet up at my place. It's almost time, but Shinozaki still isn't here.\n\r

That's rare. She's usually so early.
Marika
「
Hino-kuuuun... 
I'm sorryyyy...
!」
And then I see her running toward me.
％Ｂ
「Heeey, no need to run! What if you trip and...」

Marika
「Kyah!?」
all
％Ｂ
「Shinozaki!?」
Marika
「A-Ahahaha... I can't believe I tripped while I was running. I feel like a kid...」

％Ｂ
「That's why I was trying to warn you.」
Marika
「Sorry. I would've gotten hurt if you hadn't saved me. I was rushing because I thought I might be late.」


％Ｂ
「Speaking of which, that's not really like you. Did something happen?」

Marika
「Weeell, it took me time to get ready... Our water boiler wasn't working great, and hot water wouldn't come out. So that took up a lot of time.」


％Ｂ
「So it's your house that didn't have hot water this time? Sounds familiar.」

Though that was just 'cause we hadn't gotten the gas running.
Marika
「Ahaha, you're right. Imagine if I had to borrow your house's bath this time.」





％Ｂ
「Sure thing, you can use it whenever you want. Our bath's pretty awesome.」

I'm not kidding about that.
My dad put a lot of work into designing it.
％Ｂ
「Anyway, if you're ready, let's get going.」
Marika
「Oh... Y-Yeah. I'm ready.」

She makes a face for an instant that tells me there's something she wants to say.
％Ｂ
「What's up? Something on your mind?」
Marika
「Uh, ummm～ ...It's not a big deal... but I just realized I forgot to put sunscreen on, because I was in such a hurry...」


She looks up at the sky, worried.
The sun's rays are raining down on us.
％Ｂ
「It's supposed to get hot today too. You should definitely put sunscreen on.」

It's not like Shinozaki's got a tough body either.
There's no way this sun would be good for her.
％Ｂ
「There's still time, so you should put it on in my house.」
Marika
「What? B-But...」
％Ｂ
「No need to worry. No one else is here anyway.」
Marika
「Wh-Whaaat? I think that's the problem～」

％Ｂ
「Which means...?」
Marika
「N-Nothing! But I wouldn't want to just walk in...」

％Ｂ
「You don't need to think about it that way. There's still time, and your health is way more important. Hurry up and come in already.」


Marika
「A-Aaahhhh～～～～～～」
Marika
「Auuuuhh...」
％Ｂ
「Oh, you've got sunscreen, right?」
Marika
「Y-Yeah. I brought it in my bag. But...」

She glances my way nervously.
％Ｂ
「Right, I bet it'd be kinda hard to do with me here. I'll be waiting downstairs, then.」

Marika
「Oh, no, that's not what I meant! I'm already wearing my swimsuit underneath, so it's fine～」


％Ｂ
「A-Are you? I guess I'm wearing my swim trunks already too... All right, then just put it on.」


Marika
「O-Okay...」
I put on my swimsuit ahead of time, since there probably wouldn't be anywhere to change.
Looks like Shinozaki did the same thing.
Marika
「...」
all
She takes out her sunscreen from her bag and gently begins applying it to her hands and feet.

％Ｂ
「Uh...」
This is actually pretty awkward.
It's not like I'm doing anything bad, but I can't help but feel like I'm watching something I shouldn't be watching.

Maybe I should focus my attention on my phone or something.
Marika
「There, we, go...」
％Ｂ
「...」
Marika
「Uh, umm... Like this... M-Mmmhh～」

％Ｂ
「...Um. Hey, Shinozaki?」
Marika
「Huh? ...Wh-What is it～?」
％Ｂ
「Are you able to get your back that way?」
Shinozaki's movements are really stiff.
And I'm pretty sure she isn't able to apply it evenly, since she has to reach into her clothing.

％Ｂ
「Show me.」
Marika
「What? B-But... that's a bit... embarrassing, I think～」

％Ｂ
「Oh... Y-Yeah, that's true. Sorry. It's 'cause I'm here, right?」

Marika
「Th-That's not...」
％Ｂ
「My bad. I'll be downstairs then, so you can...」

Marika
「Um!?」
％Ｂ
「Y-Yeah?」
Marika
「U-Umm～」
Marika
「I-I don't think I got my back～ Maybe you could... look for me?」

％Ｂ
「S-Sure, of course I can. Let me see.」

all
Shinozaki pulls her T-shirt up just a bit, and I peer at her back.\n\r

As expected, there are areas she wasn't able to get.
％Ｂ
「You're gonna get burnt in patches this way.」
Marika
「I thought so... my hand can't reach all the way...」

％Ｂ
「It won't be good for your skin unless you put it on properly. Want me to do it for you?」

Marika
「Huh? ...Huuuh～?」
She goes completely red all at once.
I must've said something suggestive without thinking.
I might've been a bit too tactless about all this.
％Ｂ
「Uh, well... Sorry. Yeah, that's a no-go, right? Then, uh...」

Marika
「I-I don't think it's a bad idea～!」
％Ｂ
「Y-Yeah? Y-You don't?」
Marika
「It'd definitely be bad to not get all of my back. It might get red later on...」

Marika
「U-Umm～ ...Could I have you... do... that?」
％Ｂ
「Huh? Okay... but are you sure?」
I know I'm the one who suggested it, but I still ask.
Shinozaki gives a tiny nod.
It'd be weird to say no at this point, right?
All I'm doing is putting suncreen on her. It's nothing to get so nervous about... At least, it shouldn't be.

％Ｂ
「Got it. Turn your back toward me, then.」

Marika
「Okay...」
all
She turns around again.
I feel like her pale skin's gotten just a tad redder than earlier.

％Ｂ
「I'm gonna start then, all right?」
Marika
「O-Okay...」
After hearing her slightly nervous-sounding response, I put some sunscreen on my fingertips.

Marika
「Hyah...」
Shinozaki makes a cute sound the moment I touch her, and I pull away on reflex.

％Ｂ
「Wh-What the heck? Don't make weird sounds.」

Marika
「I think that felt a little ticklish～ ...You can be a little more confident about it, you know.」

％Ｂ
「You sure? All right.」
all
So it felt ticklish to her because I was being hesitant.
Then I'll just man up and do it, without thinking about anything weird.
％Ｂ
「Hmh!」
I scoop up a generous amount of cream and rub it onto her back.
Marika
「Hyauh...!」
％Ｂ
「Wait, you're still making weird sounds!」
Marika
「S-Sorry～ But it still tickles...」

％Ｂ
「Arghhh, I don't care anymore! I'm just gonna do it however I feel like. Take this～～～!」


Marika
「Hyaeh!? I wish you'd do it more gently～ Hyahn, it still tickles～～～～～～!」

％Ｂ
「I'm not listening!」
Marika
「Hyaaaahn～!」
all
％Ｂ
「We're sorry we're so close to being late...」
Marika
「We're sorry～」
The two of us rushed to get to the meet-up spot.
We got a little too caught up with messing around.
Misa
「Oh no, please don't apologize. I only just arrived myself.」

％Ｂ
「We got a little caught up with preparations...」
Marika
「Y-Yes. I had him put sunscreen on me and it tickled...」

％Ｂ
「H-Hey, Shinozaki?」
Marika
「...Oh.」
She only realized what she said after it was too late.
Misa
「You had him... put sunscreen on you?」
Marika
「N-No, um...」
all
％Ｂ
（Why'd you have to say that? Now she's thinking something weird.）
Marika
（S-Sorry～ I wasn't thinking...）
Misa
「That sounds wonderful! Could I have you do it for me as well?」

％Ｂ
「What? Me? For you?」
Misa
「I find it rather difficult to reach my back myself. I think it would be much easier to have an even application if someone else did it for me. Could I ask you to do so?」


％Ｂ
「U-Uh... If you're fine with me doing it...」
What? How did this end up happening?
But it'd be weird if I said no here after I did it for Shinozaki, right?
Misa
「Then, please use this sunscreen...」
Marika
「N-No, you can't!」
But then Shinozaki suddenly interrupts.
Marika
「Y-You can't do that...」
Misa
「...Why not?」
Marika
「Because... Well, um... 
Hino-kun's 
He's 
really bad at it! So, um...!」

Marika
「I-I'll do it!」
Misa
「Thank you very much! Then, if you would.」

all
Shinozaki starts putting sunscreen onto Okihara-senpai's back.
I guess this is the obvious solution.
But man, the sun sure is bright today.
Maybe I should go grab a parasol or something from somewhere.
Misa
「These are tide pools. Ocean water gets trapped in these when the tide recedes. The fish are often found in these.」

We're at the Shionagi shore.
We're a little past the beach.
There are little depressions in the rocks here.
According to Okihara-senpai, the fish get pushed toward the shore by the tide, and get trapped in these depressions when the tide goes down.

And that's how we can easily capture fish that would normally be difficult to obtain in the open sea.

Misa
「However, the footing is precarious here, so please be careful.」
％Ｂ
「We will.」
all
We cautiously look into the pools.
Marika
「Oh, there! Fish!」
Something glitters in the pool that Shinozaki's pointing at.
％Ｂ
「Ohh, there they are! Oh, in that one too! There's a lot of them, actually!」


Misa
「What do you think? Will you be able to catch them?」

％Ｂ
「I think we'll be able to. Let's give it a try.」

all
I grab the scoop net that Okihara-senpai brought.
It's like a better version of a bug-catching net.
Misa
「Let's draw seawater into this cooler box while he's catching the fish.」

Marika
「Okay. So we'll put them in there once he gets a fish, right?」

％Ｂ
「Oh, I've got one already!」
Marika
「Ah! W-Wait a second! I'll get it ready right now～」

Marika
「Wow... It's so pretty.」
Shinozaki looks fascinated with the fish inside the bucket.
It's a yellow tropical fish.
Misa
「It appears to be a butterflyfish. They're a common species among the ones found in these migratory phenomena.」

％Ｂ
「I didn't think it'd be this easy to get one. It might just be beginner's luck, though.」

Seriously. This guy literally just jumped into the net the moment I lowered it into the tide pool.

Marika
「It's so cute～ I'm sure it'll be amazing to watch lots of these fish in tanks.」


％Ｂ
「Okay! I know we were planning on just surveying today... but let's just keep on grabbing them!」
all
Boy A
「...Hey...」
％Ｂ
「Hm?」
There are suddenly some kids watching us.
Two boys and a girl.
They look like they might be in early grade school.
Boy A
「What are you guys doing?」
％Ｂ
「We're collecting these from migratory fish death.」
Boy A
「...???」
Marika
「A-Ahaha～ ...Hello there. He's catching fishies right now.」

all
Girl A
「Oh, he is! Look at the pretty fish!」

Boy B
「I know about these! It's a tropi-cal fish, right?」

Misa
「Yes, it is. It's a tropical fish known as a butterflyfish.」

all
Girl A
「You're right, it does look like a butterfly～」
Boy A
「How did you catch this? Did you fish it?」

％Ｂ
「I used this net.」
Boy A
「Seriously!? It didn't run away?」
％Ｂ
「The fish goes into the net by itself if you have an honest heart.」
The kids' faces light up in response to my playful answer.
Boy A
「I wanna try!」
Boy B
「Me too!!」
Girl A
「Me too!」
Misa
「Let's all try it together, then!」
Kids
「Yaaay♪」
Okihara-senpai smiles, and the kids smile even more and start jumping with joy.


Marika
「Then could you make a promise with us? First, what are your names?」

all
Boy A
「Rikuto!」
Boy B
「I'm Itsuki!」
Girl A
「I'm Miyuki～!」
Marika
「Rikuto-kun, Itsuki-kun, Miyuki-chan. Listen closely to what I'm about to say, okay?」


all
Rikuto & Itsuki & Miyuki
「Yes, we wiiill!」
They're super agreeable. 
Kids sure are cute when they're like that.
Marika
「First, you need to be careful of where you're stepping. Don't run, okay? And make sure you don't get close to the ocean, because it's dangerous.」


Rikuto & Itsuki & Miyuki
「Okaaay, we promiiise!」
Marika
「Very good.」
％Ｂ
「You're in pool instructor mode, Shinozaki.」
Marika
「Huh? Oh... Ahaha, I didn't even notice...」
Misa
「...Hehe.」
Shinozaki's blushing from Okihara-senpai's approving gaze.
But she really is good at dealing with kids. I'm glad Shinozaki came with.

all
Misa
「Then who would like to go first?」
Rikuto & Itsuki & Miyuki
「Meeeeeeeeee!!!」
All three of them raise their hands in unison.
Misa
「Oh my. What should we do?」
all
Marika
「Then how about the boys let the girl go first?」
Shinozaki speaks to the two boys.
Maybe it's because they've already agreed to listen to what she says, but they nod astonishingly quickly.

all
Miyuki
「Yaaay, I'm going first♪」
Rikuto
「Good luck, Miyuki!」
Miyuki
「Yeah!」
Misa
「Now then, please slowly lower the net into the water, so you don't scare the fish. The pole is long, so you won't need to get really close.」


all
Miyuki
「Okay! Gently, gently...」

She does as she was told and slowly lowers the net in.
The two boys watch over her, hardly daring to breathe.
It's almost funny how serious the whole scene is.
Misa
「Please don't get too hasty and move it. Just wait for the fish to come to you. See? They're already approaching.」

Miyuki
「Oh, they are!」
Misa
「Shhh. The fish will run away if you shout.」

all
Miyuki
「Y-Yeah... Okay.」
The girl quiets down and stares at the fish.
The two boys are also quiet, watching her.
Even we've started doing the same.
And as we watch, the fish smoothly swims right into the net of its own accord.

Marika
「Oh, it went in...」
Misa
「Now, please gently lift the net.」
Miyuki
「Y-Yes!」
She seems nervous, but she still manages to raise the net slowly and steadily.
There's a pretty tropical fish within the net.
Miyuki
「Got it!」
Marika
「Great job～♪ Wow, that's great!」

Misa
「A wonderful job!」
Miyuki
「Eheheheh♪」
Misa
「Now then, please gently transfer it over to this cooler box. The fish wouldn't like not being in water.」


all
The kids all work together to move the fish into the cooler box.
The fish starts swimming around, heedless of the tight confines.
Rikuto
「Hey, what kinda fish is this? Isn't this a really rare one?」

Misa
「This would be an immature emperor angelfish. Its stripes turn horizontal once it reaches adulthood.」

all
Itsuki
「Wow, the pattern changes when it's an adult!」
Marika
「You got a really rare one～ You were really good at that. Do you think you could teach the others how to do it?」


all
Miyuki
「Yeah, I can～」
The girl teaches the two boys what they should do.
％Ｂ
「All right! There's still another net, so I'm gonna do more! I'm not gonna lose to some kids!」

Rikuto
「Let's race then!」
Misa
「Erm, we're still only surveying today, and it would be problematic to capture too many, so please...」

all
Marika
「The idol-chan I caught's so cute～」
％Ｂ
「You just really can't get enough of watching that one, huh.」
Shinozaki's been so proud of the moorish idol tropical fish that she caught.
In case you're wondering, this is the only one that she caught.
all
But we managed to catch a lot, with some help from the kids.
I didn't expect it'd be this easy.
Marika
「Huh, where's Segawa-san?」
％Ｂ
「Are the water tanks ready... Hm?」
Our eyes widen when we walk into the classroom.
There are what look like several corpses lying inside.
Sora
「...Near death.」
all
Marika
「Whaaat?」
％Ｂ
「Why are you here, Narusawa?」
Ousaka, Segawa, and Yukimura were the only ones who were supposed to be working here today.
Rikka
「This wouldn't have happened if it weren't for LIME.」
Marika
「What? What do you mean?」
Touko
「She got dragged into this by Camera-chan...」
all
Natsuki
「It's 'cause you said to find small shells from the sand we're putting in the tanks and remove them!」

Natsuki
「I thought it'd be easy, but it was so much work!」

Misa
「It-It's something that must be done... Having shells in the sand increases the alkalinity of the water, and that can have negative effects on the fish.」


Segawa looks like she might be about to cry.
Looks like it was a lot of work.
all
Sora
「...But I found star-shaped shells. That's a plus...」
％Ｂ
「D-Did you now... Well, that's good...」
all
Natsuki
「I knew I should've gone to the sea too. I could've gotten some good photos.」


Marika
「W-We're really grateful for your work.」
all
Misa
「It seems I must apologize. I'm used to it, so I did not think it would be this difficult. But it seems you did indeed prepare the water tanks.」



Natsuki
「Of course. I said I'd do it, so I did it.」
Misa
「Then let's transfer the fish into these wonderfully well-prepared tanks.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, yes. Then I'll...」
all
I transfer the fish into the tanks.
Oriental butterflyfish, bluelashed butterflyfish, emperor angelfish...
The vividly colored fish start swimming inside the tanks.
Natsuki
「Wow, you can catch fish this pretty around here? It's like I'm in an aquarium shop.」

Segawa's taking photos, apparently having completely forgotten her exhaustion.

all
I think I'll take a few with my phone too.
Watching someone take photos just kinda makes me wanna do it too.
Marika
「They're so pretty... I'm sure it'll get even prettier once we finish everything.」

Touko
「Yeah. It might not be half bad.」
It seems like even just this many fish were able to do good things for their exhaustion.\n\r

I'm getting even more excited to complete this project now.
all
Misa
「Now then, great work today, everyone.」
％Ｂ
「You too, Senpai. Thank you very much for coming out when it was so hot.」

Misa
「I'm used to the sea. The two of you should make sure to cool down properly after receiving so much sunlight today.」


Marika
「Cool down?」
Misa
「Refrain from taking a hot bath. Instead, take a long, lukewarm bath.」

％Ｂ
「I understand. I'll try it.」
Marika
「Speaking of which, I wonder what happened to the hot water back home...? I'll send some mail later.」

Misa
「Now then, see you again tomorrow.」
％Ｂ
「Yes. See you tomorrow.」
Marika
「Great work today!」
Marika
「Whaaat～～～」
Shinozaki grumbles as she looks at her phone.
％Ｂ
「What's up?」
Marika
「Apparently our hot water's actually stopped working...」
％Ｂ
「Oh yeah, you said it wasn't working earlier today. So it broke, then?」

Marika
「I guess I'll have to go to a bathhouse today～ I want to freshen up after getting all sweaty at the ocean...」

％Ｂ
「But that'd be too hot, right? Okihara-senpai said you shouldn't take a hot bath today.」

Marika
「But a water bath would be way too cold... probably...」
％Ｂ
「Well, yeah...」
％Ｂ
「Oh, I know. Just use our bath.」

Marika
「What? At your house
, Hino-kun

? Whaaat～ but...」

％Ｂ
「I borrowed your place's bath before, right? So it's just repayment. I said you could come use it whenever, didn't I?」


Marika
「You did... but that was a joke... Auhh～」
％Ｂ
「No need to be shy. I'm the only one in the house anyway.」

Marika
「I-I think that's the main problem～」
％Ｂ
「And it's still clean 'cause it's brand new. You've got a frail body, so you need to take proper care of it.」

Marika
「Oh, mhm, thanks. B-But...」

％Ｂ
「It's fiiine, it's fine!」
Marika
「Ahhhh～～～～～～～」
Marika
「I'm here...」
％Ｂ
「I think the bath's about the right temperature～」
Marika
「Oh, o-okay!」
I return from checking the water temperature to find Shinozaki perched on the couch like some kind of decorative statue.

She's completely stiff for some reason.
％Ｂ
「You all right? Your face is red. You didn't forget to put sunscreen on your face, did you?」

Marika
「I-I'm fine. I put it on. It's just... Um, it's kinda embarrassing...」

Marika
「I'm at the house... of a boy my age...」
％Ｂ
「Huh? ...Well, I guess that's true...」
I just kinda dragged her here, but she has a point...
I wasn't really thinking much of it, since she's my childhood friend, but my parents are out of the house right now too.

％Ｂ
「My bad. I dragged you here without really thinking about it.」
Marika
「N-No, I'm fine with it... but I think other people might think it's kinda weird～」

％Ｂ
「You're right...」
But it'd be pointless for her to just go home now.
If she doesn't take a bath here, then she'll either have to take a water bath at home, or a hot bath at the bathhouse.

Ugh. Why do I have to worry so much about this?
％Ｂ
「Hmm... Growing up's kind of a pain.」

Marika
「Ahaha, yeah. I think I would've gone in without thinking about it if I were still a kid.」

％Ｂ
「Right? It's not like it'd be weird if we went to the beach or to the pool together. It's all just water.」


Marika
「Yep, yep. We did end up together at the pool that one time. Then... maybe the bath wouldn't be weird if we were wearing swimsuits?」

Shinozaki says it as if it were a joke.
Well, it has to be a joke.
But you know, that might be a good idea.
％Ｂ
「You can just wear your swimsuit, then. You have it here anyway.」

Marika
「Huh? I'm going to take a bath in a swimsuit? But...」

％Ｂ
「It wouldn't be embarrassing that way, right? That way, even if I happened to look in, you'd just be wearing your swimsuit.」

Marika
「Wh-Whaaat～ You're... going to look?」
％Ｂ
「No, that was just a hypothetical. I meant it as a peace-of-mind kinda thing.」

Marika
「W-Well... that would be embarrassing～」
％Ｂ
「Well yeah, of course. There's no way I'd look in the first place.」

Marika
「Oh, r-right! There's no way you would!」
％Ｂ
「Well, I do kinda wanna look, though.」
Marika
「......Ahh～」
％Ｂ
「No, uh... That was a joke just now...」

...Crap.
It was supposed to be a dumb joke, but it looks like she took it a bit seriously.

％Ｂ
「A-Anyway, you're fine with it if you're wearing a swimsuit, right? We could even go in together that way.」

％Ｂ
「Wh-What's wrong?」
Marika
「U-Um!」
％Ｂ
「Y-Yeah!?」
Marika
「But, um, if I'm doing that, then...」
all
Marika
「It-It's still a bit embarrassing, isn't it?」
％Ｂ
「Y-Yeah... it is. It feels a bit weird.」
...How did things end up this way again?
Actually, I already know it's because Shinozaki said "It might be okay for us to go in together."

％Ｂ
「...It-It's okay, right?」
Marika
「It's not embarrassing if we're wearing swimsuits... It's... normal. And besides, compared to last time...」

She doesn't need to finish her sentence.
She's talking about the time I borrowed her bath.
It may have been by accident, but we were both naked back then.
％Ｂ
「...」
We were legitimately naked.
Marika
「I-It'd be nice if you wouldn't remember it～! It's embarrassing...」

％Ｂ
「My bad.」
Shinozaki's face is crimson.
I feel like she might start emitting steam, even though we're taking a lukewarm bath.

％Ｂ
「Is the water too cold? Everything okay?」
Marika
「Oh, yeah, it's fine. It's just about right, and it feels nice. It looks like my skin was heated up after all.」


％Ｂ
「It's a good thing we followed Okihara-senpai's advice.」
Marika
「Yeah. I agree～」

I guess it might've been a good thing to be a bit forceful about getting her to do this.
Marika
「...」
％Ｂ
「...」
The conversation suddenly dries up.
Sitting here silently like this is a bit awkward.
It's because we're weirdly close to each other.
Marika
「Uh, um... Your bath is really amazing...」
％Ｂ
「Huh? Oh yeah, right? My dad really got into designing it. There's even a TV.」


Marika
「I'm so jealous.」
％Ｂ
「We're gonna get bored of this thing real quick, but it's so stupidly high-tech. You can even hook up your smartphone to it and stuff.」

Marika
「Whaaat? Wow. So can you watch videos on the internet, and other things like that?」

％Ｂ
「Apparently. I haven't tried it, though.」
％Ｂ
「I know, wanna try it a bit? I've got a video I took today we can watch.」

Marika
「Yeah, I wanna see!」
％Ｂ
「Just a second, then.」
I get up from the bath, grab my phone, and come back.
Marika
「How does it connect?」
％Ｂ
「You're supposed to be able to do it wirelessly... Oh, there it is.」
My smartphone's home screen appears on the bathroom monitor.
I select the video I took today and play it.
Marika
「Oh, there it is! Wow!」
It's a video of the tropical fish swimming in the tanks.
％Ｂ
「Huh, this is actually pretty nice.」
Marika
「Yeah, it really sets the mood. It might be even prettier if we turned off the lights.」

％Ｂ
「All right, let's try it.」
I turn off the lights. The darkened room is illuminated with the dim light from the screen.

％Ｂ
「Ohh, this is nice.」
The image on the screen's being vaguely reflected onto the surface of the bathwater.
It's almost as if...
Marika
「It's kind of like we're in the ocean.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, it really is.」
It's like we're completely submerged in water up to our heads. It's a really relaxing sensation.
