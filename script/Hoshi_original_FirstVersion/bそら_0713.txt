I meet up with Sora in the morning, and we head to the beach together.
％Ｂ
「Ohh... That's a lot of people.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
$$smh_OpenCHK
Sora
「...The beach opened yesterday.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, so that's why.」
Parasols bloom like flowers on the beach as young people enjoy the newly opened Shionagi beach.

％Ｂ
「All right, we should get changed too.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「Let's just go to some random beach house. How about that "Takada House" over there?」

Sora
「...No issues.」
％Ｂ
「Let's meet up there once we're done changing, then. We can rent out a parasol and tarp there, and then we'll go out to the beach.」

Sora
「...*nod*」
all
I finish changing pretty quickly and wait for Sora at the beach house.
I watch one girl after another emerge from the girls' changing room, clad in colorful swimwear.\n\r

I'm really looking forward to seeing what Sora's going to be wearing.
％Ｂ
「...She's pretty late.」
She should be out by now...
I guess I'll go rent the parasol and stuff beforehand.
％Ｂ
「Excuse meee.」
I call out to a staff member and rent a parasol and tarp.
All that's left to do now is to wait for Sora to come out...
％Ｂ
「Is she still not done changing?」
_00cutinBS
Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「Hm...?」
I see Sora poke just her head out from the changing room.
％Ｂ
「Oh, done changing?」
_00cutinBS
Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「Come on out, then.」
_00cutinBS
Sora
「...」
_00cutinBS
She looks down a little hesitantly, and then steps out.

％Ｂ
「Oh...」
Sora
「...」
Sora's swimsuit is a stylish and simple one-piece.

It's a competitive swimming type that accentuates her slim frame.

％Ｂ
「Ohh, that looks great on you.」
I give her some composed feedback.
But inside―
Oh crap...!
My girlfriend's super cute!
She might get hit on the moment I take my eyes off her!
I'm clenching my fist in utter exultation in my heart...
No, but seriously, she's so cute!
I wanna take a photo to remember this by!
Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「Huh...?」
Sora looks a little gloomy, in contrast to how happy I am.

％Ｂ
「Something wrong? You looked a little hesitant to come out earlier.」

Sora
「...It's embarrassing...」
％Ｂ
「Hm? But your swimsuit looks good on you.」
Sora
「...Unfortunately, my body lacks dynamic topography compared to others of my age. Going to the beach makes it obvious...」

She glances at the other girls wearing swimsuits nearby.
This happened yesterday too. I guess she's pretty sensitive about the fact that she's flat-chested, unexpectedly enough...

％Ｂ
「Uhh...」
all
I look around.
I see a lot of people around...
But, well... whatever.
％Ｂ
「Hey, Sora.」
I grab her hand and pull her close.
Sora
「...!?」
She freaks out a little from the suddenness.
Sora
「...?? ????」
I hug her hard.
Enough to push our chests together.
Sora
「...Auh...? Nh...?」
％Ｂ
「...Can you feel how fast my heart's beating right now?」
Sora
「...Wha... *nod*」
％Ｂ
「It's been like that ever since you came out in your swimsuit. I'm so nervous right now, wondering what I'd do if another guy came up to you.」

Sora
「...There's no issues, because I'm only interested in you
, Ryou

.」
％Ｂ
「Sweet, thanks♪
No, I mean, what I'm trying to say is... Uhh... You know! I'm saying you're just that cute!」

Sora
「～～～～」
Her face goes bright red.
And mine too...
Sora
「...Your face is bright red.」
％Ｂ
「...Don't say it... I can already feel how hot it is...」
It's pretty rough to have everyone looking at me like this.
I can hear them whispering and stuff too.
Sora
「...You didn't have to say it.」
％Ｂ
「Who cares... I wanted to say it.」
Sora
「...Thank you...」
％Ｂ
「R-Right...」
I release her and take a look at her in her swimsuit again.
％Ｂ
「So, uh... That swimsuit looks really good on you.」
Sora
「...If you like it, 
Ryou, 

then I'm happy.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah... Let's go, then.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
We grab the parasol and tarp and head to the beach.

all
I set up the parasol in the sand and lay out the tarp.
％Ｂ
「All right... Okay, this is home base for us.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「My T-shirt here beneath the parasol's the marker. Think of it as the North Star. Stay where you can see this North Star, all right? No going any further.」


％Ｂ
「If you get lost, then just link up this North Star and that beach house "Takada House," and use those as a guide. Understand?」

Sora
「...I'm not a child.」
％Ｂ
「I know, but... I feel like you're gonna get lost again.」
Sora
「...I wasn't lost back then. I was just watching the stars.」
％Ｂ
「Either way, we've got our stuff here too, so let's try to keep this area in sight.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
all
％Ｂ
「All right, then let's go!」
Sora
「...Not yet. We haven't done our warm-up exercises.」
％Ｂ
「R-Right... Okay.」
She's strangely diligent about stuff like this...
all
The two of us do some calisthenics together.
Some wiggling of the hands and feet, some bending forward, some leg stretches.
％Ｂ
「Are we ready now?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「All right, let's go!!」
all
I hold hands with Sora and run toward the sea.
％Ｂ
「Whoa! It's so cold!」
Sora
「...It's still a little cold.」
％Ｂ
「But it isn't unbearable.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「Well, it's cliché, but let's do the thing!」
Sora
「...The thing?」
％Ｂ
「A water fight. Take this!」
Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「And this, and that!」
Sora
「...Cold.」
％Ｂ
「...Come on, you gotta splash back...」
It's like I'm just bullying you at this point...
Sora
「...Splash back...」
That was so weak!
Sora
「...Nh... nh.」
％Ｂ
「You call that splashing? Take this!」
Sora
「...Npfh...」
％Ｂ
「Fhahahahaaaah! How's that!? Surrender?」
Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「U-Uh?」
Sora
「...It got in my eyes...」
％Ｂ
「M-My bad! You okay?」
I frantically run over to her.
％Ｂ
「You okay? Want me to get some water to rinse it out with?」
Sora
「...Here's my chance...」
％Ｂ
「Gasp...!」
Sora grabs my arms and pulls to throw me into the water.
Looks like her plan was to get me to let my guard down.
But―
Sora
「...Nnh... nnhh...」
％Ｂ
「...」
Sora isn't strong enough to move me, no matter how hard she tries.

Sora
「...Nnnh... nnnh...!」
What is this adorable little organism...?
I think I'm about to die from cuteness overload...
all
We start feeling a little hungry after playing for a while, so we decide to eat lunch at the beach house.

％Ｂ
「Uhh, I'd like yakisoba, please. What about you, Sora?」
Sora
「...Shaved ice... Uji tea flavor, sweet beans, lots and lots of milk.」
％Ｂ
「What? Just shaved ice?」
Sora
「...Let me eat just a bit of your yakisoba.」
％Ｂ
「You're pretty fuel efficient. But you know, yakisoba tastes amazing when you eat it in a place like this. Excuse meee, could I get a large serving of yakisoba instead?」


all
Sora stares at a poster on the wall while I'm ordering and paying for the food.

％Ｂ
「Hup, thanks for waiting. Let's get back to home base.」
Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「Sora? What are you looking at?」
I peer at the poster she's looking at from behind her.
％Ｂ
「"To commemorate the beach opening, a Best Couple Contest"?」
She's looking at a flyer for a game tournament for couples.

It's apparently being done twice between yesterday and today, and the winning couples get prizes.

％Ｂ
「You wanna enter this?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「You're kidding...」
She quirks her finger at a specific part of the poster, her eyes sparkling.

％Ｂ
「What's this? The prize?」
It's a star-shaped inner tube.

％Ｂ
「You wanna enter the contest 'cause you want that?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「I see...」
all
Well, if my girlfriend wants that, then I have no other choice.
Besides, it's to decide who the best couple is, right?
There's no way we can let some other couple beat us.
％Ｂ
「...Wanna try it, then?」
The contest starts at 2 p.m.
We'll still make it in time for registration.
Sora
「...Is it okay?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, of course. But if we're in it, then we're in it to win it!」
Sora
「...*nod*」
Let's do this.
We're gonna win the title of best couple!
all
Contest Host
「Welcome to Shionagi beach's Best Couple Contest, to commemorate opening day! We have five couples participating here today! Let's give them a round of applause～!」


And so Sora and I are participating in the contest.
There are five couples participating.
...Which is fewer than I expected.
Contest Host
「This contest is a veeery relaxed contest where the participating couples will compete in games that showcase the depth of their love, and the most in-love couple will win!」


Contest Host
「There will be three games total! There are five couples here today, so first place will be given five points, second place will be given four, and so on. The couple with the most points will be the winner!」


Contest Host
「There will be a prize for the winning couple, so let's all aim to win～」

％Ｂ
「...Let's do this, Sora.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
We give each other a thumbs-up.
all
Contest Host
「Myyy～ It looks like one of the couples is already raring to go～ Now then, let's start the games! This is the first one!」


Contest Host
「"Dig out your buried boyfriend! The Mole Girlfriend Game"! A round of applause, everyone～!」

Contest Host
「This game involves having the boyfriend buried in sand. His girlfriend will have to dig him out by hand.」


Contest Host
「Boyfriends, once you have escaped the sand, please kiss your girlfriend on the cheek. The couple who kisses first will be the winner～」


％Ｂ
「A kiss, huh... I guess it's fine if it's on the cheek...」
It's a little embarrassing, but I'll do it for Sora.
Contest Host
「Also, the boyfriend is also allowed to move to try to escape. You can both cooperate to escape as quickly as possible～」


We'll need a lot of strength to dig me out of the sand.
But Sora isn't that strong.
Which means I'll have to make up for it...!
Contest Host
「Now then, staff members, if you would please bury the boyfriends～」
There are already holes dug out for us to lie down in to be buried.

％Ｂ
「Let's do our best, Sora.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
all
I've been buried deeper than I was expecting...
I've tried moving my arms and legs, but I can't move them at all.
This is pretty tough...
％Ｂ
「Sora... Let's put together a strategy.」
Sora
「...What strategy?」
％Ｂ
「I think cooperation between the two of us is a must for this. So my guess is it's going to all be decided by how soon I can start helping you. That's why─」


I want you to start with my upper body.
I want you to start with my lower body.
％Ｂ
「'Cause I'll be able to dig with you as soon as my hands are free.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「Don't worry. You can count on me.」
all
Contest Host
「Okay, then let's start the game. Ready～ ...Start!」
Sora
「...Nh... nh... nh...」
The whistle sounds, and Sora starts digging at my upper body... especially focusing on the area around my arms.

She's digging at a slower rate than the other couples.
But she's efficiently lessening the weight on my dominant hand.
Sora
「...Nh, hahh... hahh... Nn, hahh...!」
She's sweating from how hard she's trying.
I move my hand in small movements, trying to escape the pressure of the sand.
And then─
all
％Ｂ
「Aaaaaahhhh!」
Sfloooosh!
Contest Host
「Ohh～! It looks like boyfriend number three's already gotten his hand loose! He's started digging away at the sand on him on his own!」

％Ｂ
「Oooooooooohhhhh!」
Contest Host
「How incredible! Boyfriend number three's pushing away more and more sand! Ahh, he's already able to sit up! And his girlfriend's digging away at his feet, as if they had planned this all out!」


％Ｂ
「All right, Sora, move away a bit!」
She immediately obeys.
Sora's already gotten rid of enough of the sand to reduce the weight, so...
all
％Ｂ
「Don't count out an ex-soccer playeeeeeeeerrrr!!!!」
Sfploooosh!
I kick up as hard as I can and release myself from the sand.
％Ｂ
「All right!」
Contest Host
「Boyfriend number three has escaped the sand! And what comes next is～?」

％Ｂ
「Sora!」
Sora
「...*nod*」
I hold her close and kiss her on her right cheek.
Contest Host
「Couple number three takes first place～!」
％Ｂ
「Hahh, hahh, hahh... We did it, Sora.」
Sora
「...Mm.」
We give each other our usual thumbs-up in triumph.
％Ｂ
「I used to play soccer. I should be able to do more with my legs than with my arms.」

Sora
「...*nod*」
all
Contest Host
「Okay, then let's begin. Ready～ ...Start!」
The girls all start digging at the signal.
Sora starts digging too, focusing lower─digging the sand away from around my legs.

％Ｂ
「Keep it up, Sora!」
Sora
「...Nh... nh... Hahh... hahh...」
She sweats as she tries her hardest to move the sand.
I can feel the weight on my legs lessen thanks to her efforts.
％Ｂ
「...All right! That's enough! Sora, step away a bit!」
She pulls away.
all
％Ｂ
「Nnnnnaaaaaaaaaahhhh!」
Sfloooooshh!
Contest Host
「Ohh～ Boyfriend number three has already freed his legs! That was fast!」

％Ｂ
「All right! Next─」
Kick kick... Kick kick...
％Ｂ
「Ne...Next...」
Kick kick... Kick kick...
Contest Host
「Boyfriend number three's just kicking his legs in vain!」

...Oh no!
Freeing my legs doesn't help me get the sand off of my upper body...!
％Ｂ
「...Heheh... Sorry about this, Sora... My plan's a complete failure...」
Sora
「...No issues... We have yoga.」
％Ｂ
「Owwwhh, ow, ow, ow! Wait! Sora! My joints don't bend that way!」

all
Contest Host
「Couple number one in first place! Number five in second! Numbers two and four after that! If the staff members could please help dig boyfriend number three out!」

％Ｂ
「Hahhhh... Haaahhh... Let's do better for the next one.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
all
Contest Host
「Now then, let's move onto the second game! The second game is... "Follow your girlfriend's voice! The Bat Boyfriend Game"! Let's have a round of applause～!」


Contest Host
「The boyfriends will be blindfolded and spun around on the spot as when you do watermelon splitting!」

Contest Host
「The girlfriends will be calling for their boyfriends from further away, and so we would like each boyfriend to follow his girlfriend's voice to walk to where she is while blindfolded.」


Contest Host
「Once a boyfriend has managed to get to where his girlfriend is, he will remove his blindfold and again, kiss his girlfriend on the cheek!」

Contest Host
「Please be careful not to put your arms around another couple's girlfriend～」

％Ｂ
「I get it... So we need to follow our girlfriend's voice to get to them while we're blindfolded...」

There's no way I could ever mistake Sora's voice for another. This one's in the bag.

Contest Host
「Those of you in the audience, let's all also yell out to try to get in their way～」

％Ｂ
「Whoa... That's gonna be rough...」
Not good... Sora's quiet, so there's a good chance her voice could get drowned out.

％Ｂ
「Sora... We're gonna put together another strategy.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「This game's all about testing how strong our bond is. So─」

Say something that only I'd know you'd say.
Say my name in your heart, strongly.
％Ｂ
「Say something that only I'd know you'd say.」
Sora
「...What do I say?」
％Ｂ
「...I'll leave it up to you. The audience might mimic it if it's too simple.」

Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「I'll find your voice for sure. I'm counting on you.」
all
Contest Host
「Now then, if the staff members would please blindfold the boyfriends!」

They place an eye mask over my eyes and then tie a towel on top.
I can't see a thing.
Contest Host
「Now then, let's begin. Ready～ ...Start!」
％Ｂ
「Agh... You've gotta be kidding me...」
There are a ton of people saying all kinds of different things.
I might not be able to tell Sora's voice apart from the rest after all...
Sora
「...Sirius, Polaris, Vega, Altair, Deneb.」
％Ｂ
「Oh...」
I-I know that voice!
Sora
「...Alpha Centauri, Procyon, Capella.」
It's Sora!
It has to be her!
I take a step toward her voice.
Contest Host
「Would you look at that～! Boyfriend number three has already started walking～! Can he tell apart his girlfriend's voice amidst all this noise～?」

I can... I definitely can.
I can clearly hear Sora's voice listing off stars!
Sora
「...Alpha Crucis, Beta Crucis, Hadar, Canopus.」
Contest Host
「How incredible! Boyfriend number three's moving further and further! But is that really the right direction～?」

I know it's the right direction.
No one other than my girlfriend could list off all of these stars!
Sora
「...Achernar, Pollux, Betelgeuse, Antares, Fomalhaut, Arcturus, Spica―」

There's no way I could be wrong!
％Ｂ
「Sora!」
I just know the girl standing in front of me is her. I hug her tight.
And then I remove the blindfold.
Sora
「...
Ryou
Mm
.」
See!?
I knew it!
Sora
「...Mmh...」
I kiss her left cheek.
Contest Host
「Couple number three wins this game, it's no contest～! Very well done～!」
％Ｂ
「We did it, Sora!」
Sora
「...*nod*」
We give each other another thumbs-up.
％Ｂ
「If you call my name in your heart, then I'll know. I'll be able to find you.」

Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「That'll be enough for us.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
all
Contest Host
「Now then, if the staff members would please blindfold the boyfriends!」

They place an eye mask over my eyes and then tie a towel on top.
I can't see a thing.
Contest Host
「Okay, now let's begin. Ready～ ...Start!」
％Ｂ
「Hmph...」
Scream all you want. All this noise is doing is distracting the other couples. For us, it might as well be cheering us on.

Now then. I'll calm my heart...
Think of Sora...
...
Contest Host
「What's this～? Boyfriend number three's the only one who isn't moving at all! Is he okay?」

％Ｂ
「...Hmph...」
I can't hear anything...
No, I can't give up! If the voice of the heart doesn't work, then I'll use the eyes of the heart! Follow the vision of my soul!
I'll find the ray of light known as Sora in the darkness!
My very own Polaris, gleaming in the wide expanse of space!
Splash... Splash... Splash...
Contest Host
「Oh nooo～ That's the ocean, boyfriend number three! Is he trying to return to the womb of all life, the ocean!?? That's not where your girlfriend is!」


Contest Host
「And boyfriend number four has finished! And boyfriend number two right after him! And there's boyfriend number one! And five!」


Sora
「...It didn't reach you?」
％Ｂ
「...That plan was a little too absurd... Sorry...」
all
Contest Host
「Now, it's time for the final game! Our last game for today is... "A romantic game of catch! The Lovey-Dovey Toss-and-Pass Game"! Let's have a round of applause～!」


Contest Host
「The final game is very simple! Boyfriends and girlfriends, please hit a beach ball filled with love back and forth between the two of you.」


Contest Host
「The ball can be kicked or headered as well. The couple who lets the ball hit the ground last will be the winner of this game!」


％Ｂ
「...Sora. How good are you at this kinda physical stuff?」
Sora
「...*shake shake*」
％Ｂ
「Really...」
There are no strategies to be used here.
I'll just have to do everything I can to cover for Sora to make sure the ball doesn't fall!

％Ｂ
「Just try not to miss the ball, and when you hit it, hit it as high up as you can. I'll do something about the rest.」


Sora
「...*nod*」
all
Contest Host
「Now then, do all couples have a ball? Then let's begin. Ready～ ...Start!」

％Ｂ
「Here goes, Sora!」
Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「Here!」
Sora
「...Nh.」
％Ｂ
「There we go, like that!」
Sora
「...Nh.」
Contest Host
「Now then, it seems all of the couples are doing quite... Oh no～! Couple number two has already dropped their ball～! A drop-out already～!」


％Ｂ
「Here!」
Sora
「...Nh.」
％Ｂ
「Hup!」
Sora
「...Nh.」
Nice, things are going well.
If we can just keep going like this...
all
Contest Host
「Couple number four has also dropped their ball～! What a shame～! That leaves just couples one, three, and five! Which couple will be the last one left～?」


％Ｂ
「Rrah!」
Sora
「...Ah.」
all
％Ｂ
「Whoah!?」
Sora
「...Sorry.」
％Ｂ
「It's fine. Let's stay calm and keep going.」
all
Contest Host
「Now, the three remaining couples all seem very steady... but as soon as I said that, couple number five dropped their ball～! Which leaves only couples one and three!～」


Contest Host
「Which of these two couples will be able to keep their love ball up in the air until the very end～!?」

There's nothing to worry about. If we keep going like this, we'll be able to―
Sora
「...Ah...!?」
all
Contest Host
「Ohhhh no! Girlfriend number three has hit the ball very far to the side! Is this the end～!?」

％Ｂ
「Kh... I'm not gonna let it end like this...!」
Contest Host
「Boyfriend number three sprints after the ball～! Will he make it in time～!? Will his love reach～!?」

％Ｂ
「Don't count out an ex-soccer playeeeeeeeeeeerrrrr!!!!」
I desperately kick out with my foot.
_ef_ryusen03
_ef_ryusen04
Contest Host
「Boyfriend number three kicked the ball up an instant before it hit the ground～! Very impressive～!」

Sora
「...Amazing. You made it...!」
％Ｂ
「Heh... How's that!?」
all
Contest Host
「Would you look at that～! In the meantime, girlfriend number one has dropped the ball! Which means that couple number three is the winner of this game～!」


％Ｂ
「All right! We did it, Sora!」
Sora
「...*nod*!」
Contest Host
「Let's have the winning couple do the usual kiss! He went right cheek, then left, which would only leave～...!」


％Ｂ
「Wha...?」
Which would only leave～... Uh, her lips...?
No, but that isn't something to just do in front of so many people.
％Ｂ
「...Sora. Come here.」
I wave her over and hold her by the shoulders.
Sora looks around nervously, but eventually closes her eyes tight.

I give her a peck of the lips on her forehead.
all
Contest Host
「How wholesooome! What an incredibly wholesome couple!」
Contest Host
「And so, and so! The overall winner is the incredible couple number three, who came in first for all three games! You have earned the title of Best Couple～!」


％Ｂ
「Sora!」
Sora
「...Mm!」
We pop our thumbs up at each other.
Contest Host
「And finally, we will now give the Best Couple their prize～ The prize is this, a starfish-shaped inner tube!」


％Ｂ
「Uh...」
...A starfish?
...It's not just a regular star?
all
Contest Host
「Congratulations～!」
Sora
「...」
Sora accepts the inner tube from the host.
Her expression is stoic, but I can see she's frowning just a little.
％Ｂ
「...I guess it's a starfish, not a star...」
Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「It's a shame it wasn't a star... Yeah?」
Sora
「...」
Oh, she's actually pretty down about this...
Yeah, I guess that makes sense. She only put in all that effort because she thought it was a star...

％Ｂ
「But it's still a star, when you think about it. A star of the sea, you know? It's right there in the name.」

Sora
「...A star...」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, it's a star of the sea. So it's still a star!」
Sora
「...Star of the sea...」
％Ｂ
「So what do you think? Satisfied?」
Sora
「...Mm... mmm... Mmh!」
She's given me her thumbs-up of approval.
％Ｂ
「Rrrraaaaaaaahhhhh!」
I reach out as far as I can.
But―
Contest Host
「Ahhh! Boyfriend number three was so very close～! But he's dropped the ball～! What a shame～!」

％Ｂ
「Auughh... I couldn't do it...」
Contest Host
「And so, couple number one would be the best couple for today's contest～! Congratulations～!」

％Ｂ
「Sigh... We lost.」
I trudge back to Sora.
Sora
「...But it was fun.」
％Ｂ
「Was it?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
She nods and squeezes my hand tight.
Sora
「...You tried your best for me. So... this is okay.」



％Ｂ
「Sora...」
I squeeze her hand back.
It's a shame we lost... but if Sora's happy, then I guess it's fine.

all
The beach clears out entirely once the sun goes down.
All of the beach houses are already closed. There's only the sound of the waves lapping against the shore. It's hard to believe it was as crowded as it was during the day.

％Ｂ
「Ohh... Yeah, you can see the stars pretty well here too.」
$$smh_OpenCHK
We sit on the sand after changing out of our swimsuits and look up at the night sky.

％Ｂ
「It's a shame we don't have a telescope.」
Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「Sora?」
Sora
「...Fhh...」
She shivers.
％Ｂ
「What's wrong? You cold?」
Sora
「...No issues.」
％Ｂ
「You don't have to force yourself.」
The seaside breeze is a little chilly.
We may be wearing our normal clothes now, but it's still cold when we're sitting still like this.
all
％Ｂ
「Here we go...」
I reposition myself behind Sora and wrap my arms around her.

％Ｂ
「Here's a combination windbreaker, blanket, and heater. Feel a little better now?」
Sora
「...It's warm.」
She places her hands on my arms and leans against me.

We look up at the stars together, listening to the gentle sound of the waves.
I can see the Milky Way and all the stars surrounding it clearer than I ever have before.
The Summer Triangle's shining bright too.
％Ｂ
「By the way...」
Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「Why'd Orihime and Hikoboshi have to be separated? They're lovers, right?」

Sora
「...Orihime was the daughter of Tentei. Tentei was the ruler of the heavens. Orihime was a weaver, and her job was to weave clothes for the gods.」


Sora
「Hikoboshi was a young cattle herder who lived along the Milky Way. He was a serious, hardworking man, and he cared for the cattle in heaven. Orihime's father introduced Hikoboshi to his daughter so he could be her groom.」


Sora
「The two of them fell in love as soon as they saw each other, and married soon after.」

％Ｂ
「So they fell in love at first sight and got married right away. I guess the gods were more human than I thought.」

Sora
「...The two of them were heads over heels for each other. They did lots of cute stuff together every day. And they got too cutesy, so the ruler of the heavens got angry.」


Sora
「...The two of them stopped doing their work because their marriage was so much fun. Orihime stopped weaving, and Hikoboshi stopped following his cattle.」


Sora
「The gods' clothing was in tatters because Orihime stopped making clothes. The cows became sick because Hikoboshi wasn't looking after them.」

Sora
「The ruler of the heavens got angry and separated the two. To the east and west, with the Milky Way between them.」

％Ｂ
「Ahh... Kinda got too caught up in the honeymoon phase, I guess. It might be their fault, but I feel sorry for them getting separated.」

Sora
「...*nod* The ruler of the heavens saw how sad his daughter Orihime had become, and decided to allow her to see Hikoboshi just once every year. The seventh day of the seventh month. Tanabata.」


％Ｂ
「I get it... Oh, then it's not like the two broke up. They're still married.」

Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「So they're forced to be in a long-distance relationship. I feel pretty sorry for that too.」
Sora
「...And if it rains on July 7th, the Milky Way river rises, and Orihime can't cross it to see Hikoboshi.」


Aaaghh... Now that's a tragedy...
％Ｂ
「So the moral of the story is that it's okay to do cute stuff with your lover, but make sure you do your work properly too.」

Sora
「...Those who do not work may not be cutesy.」
％Ｂ
「We should be careful too, then.」
Sora
「...Are we doing that too much?」
％Ｂ
「I dunno if it's too much, but we're definitely doing it. But it's no problem if we do our work, right? Let's work hard on preparing for the Tanabata Festival starting tomorrow.」


Sora
「...*nod*」
Sora
「I know it'll be okay with you
, Ryou

.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah.」
I squeeze Sora in my arms in response.
She relaxes as if reassured by my hug, and leans against me more.

％Ｂ
「We gotta find ourselves some jobs first. To make money to rent the projector.」

Sora
「...What kind of jobs should we do?」
％Ｂ
「Good question... One that's short-term and pays by the week or by the day would be best. We'd really be up against it in terms of time if we had to wait a month to get paid.」


％Ｂ
「And what'd be really great is if we could find a job we could both work together. It'd be more fun that way.」

Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「Either way, let's find one as soon as we can.」
Sora
「...Nnh...」
She shivers again in my arms.
％Ｂ
「It's getting kinda cold. Let's start heading home.」
all
We stand up together and wipe the sand off of our butts.
Sora
「...I want to come again.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. Let's come here together again.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
all
We hold hands and put the nighttime beach behind us.
