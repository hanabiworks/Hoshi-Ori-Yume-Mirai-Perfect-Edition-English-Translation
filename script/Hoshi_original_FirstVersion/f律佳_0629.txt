...I should've seen this coming.
My head's full of thinking about our date later, and I can't focus on our lesson at all.

But Narusawa's using one of her precious days off to help me.
I need to focus, focus!
％Ｂ
「Huh? Isn't that different from before?」
Rikka
「Wha... Oh... I'm sorry. Could you start over again from where we were earlier?」

％Ｂ
「Okay. Thanks.」
She almost never messes up her playing.
If she's distracted because of what's coming after this like I am, then I'd feel a little guilty, but happy too.
In the end, we don't end up making much progress today because we're both a little off.

all
Once practice is over, the date begins.
Putting the matter as to whether Narusawa thinks this is a date or not aside, I've already made thorough preparations.

I picked out some date spots from the internet and local magazines after Narusawa said she'd come yesterday.

I had Shuuichi ask Kaori-san for a few little-known spots that a girl might like.

I put together a date plan that I thought would make Narusawa happy, and also took a look at those places today before going to Narusawa's.

I want it to be a success, no matter what.
And...
I want to tell her how I feel.
I'm getting the feeling...
Today might end up being the longest day of my life.
Rikka
「Could I ask you to entertain yourself outside for about an hour? I need to get ready to go.」
％Ｂ
「Huh? Oh, sure. Got it. I'll just walk around the area, then.」
Rikka
「Thank you. I'll send you a message once I'm ready.」
I've heard before that girls take a long time to get ready for stuff like this.

Though I dunno if an hour's short or long compared to most women, since I only have my mother to compare against.

They probably have a lot to take care of, unlike guys who just need to take clothes off or put them on.
％Ｂ
「...Now then, I think I'll go preview the date plan one more time while I'm waiting.」
Narusawa's getting ready to go somewhere with me.
Thinking about it's making the waiting time fun too.
An hour passes in a blink of an eye as I'm simulating my way through the date plan.

I'm meeting up with Narusawa near her apartment complex.
Rikka
「I'm sorry. It took longer than I expected...」
％Ｂ
「It's totally fine.」
％Ｂ
「...」
My brain stops working when I see Narusawa.
Her hair flutters behind her. She must have taken a bath.
A sweet, slightly mature-smelling citrus fragrance wafts over to me on the wind.

She has a thin layer of lip balm on.
Knowing that she's done all this just to go out with me fills my heart.

It looks great on you.
You look pretty.
％Ｂ
「Y-You put makeup on. It looks great on you.」
Rikka
「Wha...?」
She runs her fingers through her hair, looking a little surprised. 
I can see her cheeks are red through the strands of her hair.
Rikka
「...Th-Thank you.」
％Ｂ
「Y-You put on makeup. You... You look pwetty...!」
Rikka
「...Pwetty?」
I fucked it uuuupp!
I screwed up the words at the worst possible moment.
I shouldn't have said something that I'm not used to saying.
Dammit. I'm so embarrassed.
Rikka
「Pff... Hehe, hehehe... Ahaha!」
She seems to find it hilarious.
I guess it's the natural reaction.

Rikka
「I-I'm sorry... Hehe... The way you said that was a little adorable.」

％Ｂ
「W-Well, excuse me!」
Rikka
「No, it's fine... So what do you think of me?」
She looks up at me bashfully.
She must be trying to give me the opportunity to retry.
Her cheeks are red.
％Ｂ
「You're pretty. I think you look really great.」
Rikka
「Thank you. Hehe, that makes me happy.」
My heart rate spikes when she smiles.
...Crap, not good.
We haven't even gotten started yet, but I'm already stupidly excited.

Am I gonna make it through the entire rest of the day like this?
Rikka
「Hino-kun?」
Rikka
「...?」
％Ｂ
「Oh... Let's get going, then.」
Rikka
「Yes. Where are we going, anyway?」
％Ｂ
「How about we start with a movie? I've already got tickets.」

I show her the two tickets.
I bought them this morning.
I looked up the currently airing ones and picked out one that I thought she'd like.

There were two candidates, but Shuuichi told me a pure romance movie would be too on the nose if we aren't dating, so I decided on the love-and-action one.

Rikka
「That's the one they're showing on commercials all the time. Didn't Mr. Schiele compose and conduct part of the soundtrack?」

I've already looked into that.
Franz Schiele is a very famous Austrian conductor who also plays piano and composes pieces.

This movie is apparently his swan song, since he's planning on retiring as an artist after this year.

A lot of effort seems to have gone into the film's score, with several other famous composers also apparently involved.

％Ｂ
「"Mr. Schiele"?」
No way, right?
But you wouldn't usually call someone you've never met that.
Rikka
「My mom studied under him a long time ago when she studied abroad at a conservatory in Paris. I've met him a few times when I was little too.」

Rikka
「He's a very famous conductor and performer, but you'd never know that from how friendly and easygoing he is. He's also a huge fan of Japan.」


％Ｂ
「I'm not surprised at all that you know someone that famous.」
Rikka
「It's not like I'm amazing for it. I was just there with my mom.」

I think it's amazing enough just to be acquainted with him.
You couldn't even do that without the right connections.
It's a world I can't even imagine.
％Ｂ
「So anyway, how about it?」
Rikka
「I've been wanting to see that too. I'm looking forward to it.」
％Ｂ
「That's great. We'll make it in time for a showing if we go now, so let's go.」

Rikka
「Let's.」
all
And so my battle today begins.
We go window shopping along Shionagi's main street after watching the movie.
I'm used to being in the marketplace, but walking into unfamiliar stores still gets me nervous.

The biggest thing is that these stores are filled with girls.
Which makes sense, since they're mostly fancy or fashionable stores that are marketed toward women.

％Ｂ
「Narusawa. That store's got a lot of mature-looking jewelry imported from overseas.」

％Ｂ
「It might have something that looks good on you.」
I point out a cozy-looking store nestled a little deeper among the other shops.

It's one of the little-known spots that Kaori-san mentioned yesterday.
％Ｂ
「Wanna go take a look?」
Rikka
「...」
I thought for sure she'd respond with a "Yes, let's" or something, but she just glares at me.

...Is she mad for some reason?
％Ｂ
「Uh... Did you wanna go to a different store?」
Rikka
「No, that's not it... You just seem to really be familiar with dates.」

％Ｂ
「Wha? Huh? Why do you think that?」
Rikka
「Because you know about all of these fashionable stores. You must come here a lot with other girls.」

Wait, she's not mad...
She's sulking?
％Ｂ
「N-No! I've never gone on a date before! You're the first!」

Rikka
「...What? I'm the first?」
％Ｂ
「Y-Yeah. I've never even asked someone to go out with me like this before you.」

％Ｂ
「I didn't really wanna say it 'cause it's embarrassing, but I did a ton of research so this'd be fun for you.」


Rikka
「I see, so this would be fun for me... Hehe.」
She gives me a very warm smile.
Rikka
「Why are you so embarrassed about that? I'm really happy to hear you looked into so many things for me.」


％Ｂ
「Huh?」
Rikka
「Let's take a look at that store. You said we might find something that looks good for me, right?」

all
Narusawa, suddenly in a good mood, leads the way to the store.
Rikka
「It's a silver necklace. I wonder if these are moonstones here in the center and top right.」

She's looking at a necklace with two connected eighth notes as a design.

There's a large, round, pearly-white stone set into the center of the necklace, with a slightly smaller one to the top right.

Rikka
「The moon is feminine in German and Spanish. Moonstones are said to grant allure to women.」

％Ｂ
「Really... Oh yeah, there's flower language, so is there something like that for gemstones too?」

Rikka
「There is. Moonstones mean "pure love," or "premonitions of love"... They're gemstones that communicate love.」

％Ｂ
「Gemstones that communicate love...」
Sounds perfect to me.
Narusawa's apparently taken a liking to the necklace. She's balancing it in the palm of her hand, watching it glitter.

I check the price tag. It's expensive, but not out of reach for me.
But would it be weird for me to buy her a present when today isn't a special day or anything?

％Ｂ
「...」
If I'm gonna regret it either way, then I'd rather regret it after doing it instead of regretting that I didn't.

％Ｂ
「Narusawa! I'll buy you that as a present!」
Rikka
「Wha... But you don't have to do that.」
％Ｂ
「I want to. I'm sure it'd look great on you.」
I take the necklace from her as she struggles to respond and bring it to the register.

It might be a little forceful of me, but I don't really think I would've been able to convince her perfectly anyway.

I have the lady at the counter wrap it as a present.
I've given people stuff as thanks for Valentine's or for their birthdays before, but I've never given a girl a present with these kinds of intentions.

I accept the neatly packaged necklace in its case and go back over to Narusawa.
％Ｂ
「It's a present from me. Could I get you to accept this?」
I hold out the necklace. Narusawa still looks surprised, and says...
Rikka
「...Did you know that today was my birthday?」
％Ｂ
「...Hm? Birthday?」
Birthday, she says.
％Ｂ
「Wha... Today's your birthday?」
Rikka
「Mhm... Huh?」
％Ｂ
「Whaaaaat!? What the heck!? Why didn't you tell me!?」

Rikka
「Because it's... Is that something I should have told you?」
％Ｂ
「Of course it is!」
Rikka
「I'm sorry... Moonstones are the birthstone for June, so I thought it might have been...」

％Ｂ
「You can't expect me to know stuff like that!」
Rikka
「Then why did you buy me this...?」
％Ｂ
「That's 'cause... 'cause it looked like you wanted it. I wanted to give it to you as a present no matter what.」

Rikka
「What? That's it?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. That's it.」
It's more than enough reason for me.
％Ｂ
「Well, then... The order's gotten a bit mixed up, but let's say it's a birthday present. Could you accept this?」

Rikka
「Hehe... This is the first time I've gotten a birthday present from someone who isn't family... Thank you.」
She smiles happily and accepts the necklace.
％Ｂ
「Still though, I had no idea today was your birthday...」
I dunno if we should stop after window shopping like I was planning if today's her birthday.

％Ｂ
「I know. Let's get everyone together to celebrate.」
Rikka
「Right now?」
％Ｂ
「'Course. You mind if it's at your place?」
Rikka
「I don't mind...」
【％Ｂ】「Today's apparently #NNarusawa's birthday. #NI'm thinking of #Nthrowing a party right #Nnow. Who can come?」
【Natsuki】「Excuse me!?」
Segawa replies first.
Rikka
「Segawa-san's angry.」
％Ｂ
「Sure is.」
Narusawa probably thinks she's mad because of the sudden proposal, but I know it's for another reason.

【Natsuki】「What the heck, Rikka! #NYou should at least let #Nus know when it's your #Nbirthday. Of course #NI'll be there!」
Rikka
「Oh...!」
【Marika】「Happy birthday! ...I #Nguess I should say that #Nonce I get there. I'd #Nalso like to #Nparticipate.」
【Sora】「I'll come.」
【Touko】「I'm bored of walking #Naround the marketplace #Nanyway, so I think I'll #Ncome. But is it really #Nokay for us to come?」
【％Ｂ】「Of course. Why do you #Nask?」
【Touko】「I just happened to see #Nyou and Piano-chan #Nhaving fun picking out #Njewelry together. #NYou're with her right #Nnow, aren't you?」
Rikka
「...!」
％Ｂ
「She saw us...」
It's a little embarrassing to be witnessed by someone we know.
【Marika】「Oh, I think I might #Nhave something I meed #nto do!」
And now Shinozaki's trying to be considerate.
Plus, she made a typo.
【％Ｂ】「If it isn't anything #Ntoo important, then I #Nwant you to come to the #Nparty.」
【Misa】「I apologize for my #Ntardiness. I would also #Nlike to accept the #Ninvitation to this #Nparty!」
【％Ｂ】「Let's all meet up at #NNarusawa's place in two #Nhours, then. Bring food #Nand snacks if you've #Ngot some.」
【Sora】_st_0310
【Natsuki】「So the groom handles #Nthe wedding cake?」
【Natsuki】_st_0210
【％Ｂ】「Quiet with the groom #Nstuff. But I'll take #Ncare of the cake since #NI'm organizing, so you #Nguys bring other stuff.」
【Marika】「Is pickled lotus root #Nand stuff okay?」
【Touko】「That sounds good. Some #Nreal Japanese mom's #Nhome cooking. Did you #Nmake it?」
【Marika】「Mhm. Mom's home #Ncooking... That's a bit #nembarrassiiing.」
【Marika】_st_0101
【Misa】「I believe I have some #Ngifted snacks left #Nover, and so I will be #Nbringing those.」
【％Ｂ】「Please do. Let's all meet in two hours, then!」
％Ｂ
「And that's what's happening.」
Rikka
「You're very forceful.」
％Ｂ
「Are we being a bother?」
Rikka
「No.」
She shakes her head a little.
all
％Ｂ
「Narusawa―」
Sora & Marika & Natsuki & Misa & Touko & ％Ｂ
「Happy birthday!」
The sound of poppers echoes, and brightly colored ribbons fly through the air.
Rikka
「Th-Thank you...」
all
We all clink our glasses against Narusawa's. She looks somewhat dazed.

There are snacks and food arranged on the table. It's a pretty legitimate party, despite the short notice.
I see pickled lotus root, seaweed strips, and takoyaki that were probably picked up at the store at the marketplace.

There are even high-class looking western baked goods. The sheer variety's just like us, and it just adds to the scene.

And in the center is the whole no-bake cheesecake that I bought.\n\r

There's a container of orange sauce to pour on top next to it.
Touko
「You don't see many people get cheesecake for their birthday.」
％Ｂ
「I didn't have the time to order a birthday cake, so I went with something they had in-store. I figured this was perfect, since Narusawa likes cheesecake.」

all
Natsuki
「Hohoh. And so I guess we should take that as your way of bragging about how you've even got her preferences figured out?」

Sora
「...Pretending to be her boyfriend?」
％Ｂ
「Thank you very much for the rather impressively brutal comment, Ousaka.」
％Ｂ
「I just happen to know about it. You know it too, Segawa. Remember how we saw her buy that cup cheesecake at the supermarket before?」


Natsuki
「I'm surprised you remember something that minor. Or perhaps it's because there's a reason it was especially memorable for you, hohohoh!」


％Ｂ
「Ghhh...! I-I've just got a good memory.」
Marika
「Y-Yeah, that's why, I'm sure. He's always had great memory! He'll do great for the upcoming exams too!」

all
Touko
「Now that's impressive! I'm not too great when it comes to tests. Think you can teach me a trick or two?」
％Ｂ
「Gh...」
They're totally doing this on purpose.
all
Misa
「I am also confident in my memorization ability, so I can help you if you would like.」

Ohh, that's Okihara-senpai for you!!
Misa
「Then Rikka-san, are you aware of 
Ryousuke-san's 
his 
preferences also, then?」

％Ｂ
「...」
all
Everyone looks at Narusawa.
Well, I doubt she's gonna give any real answer. She has to know they're teasing us.

Rikka
「I do.」
％Ｂ
「...Uh. Narusawa...?」
She glances my way and then turns back toward the others.
Rikka
「He likes fried chicken, ground beef steak, ginger pork... He apparently likes meat dishes in general. He also said he liked the fried egg that I made him.」


Marika
「Fueehhh...」
Natsuki
「Oh dear.」
Misa
「Oh my.」
Everyone's taken aback.

Touko
「Sorry, did you just say you made him fried eggs? Like, homemade?」

％Ｂ
「H-Hey, Narusawa!」
Rikka
「It's the truth, isn't it?」
％Ｂ
「It is, but...」
Sora
「She makes food for him...」
Touko
「Kaff... I've got heartburn, and we haven't even started on the cake yet.」
all
Misa
「You two are very close. How wonderful!」

Marika
「Ehehe, good for you two.」
％Ｂ
「Hahaha...」
All I can manage is a dry laugh. It's so obvious how I feel.
all
％Ｂ
「Anyway, how about we have cake? I've even got candles.」
Rikka
「I said we didn't need them...」
％Ｂ
「It's tradition, isn't it?」
Natsuki
「You know what they say. What happens here stays here.」
all
％Ｂ
「I get what you're trying to say, but that's not the right phrase for this, just so you know.」
Touko
「Me, meee! I want to put the candles in!」
all
Sora
「Me too.」
Touko
「Mmm... How about we split them, then?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
Yukimura and Ousaka happily start sticking the candles along the cake perimeter. What on earth is so fun about that?

all
Rikka
「I'll get a knife and some plates.」
％Ｂ
「I'll get them. You're the star for today, so you can sit back and relax.」
Rikka
「...Thank you. Could you, then?」
％Ｂ
「Sure thing.」
all
Natsuki
「I can't believe he's even familiar with your kitchen... Things progressed faster than Natsuki-chan could've ever imagined.」

％Ｂ
「...」
A witch whispers into my ear...
Natsuki
「Well, I won't ask anything insensitive, since it's a good thing. Wouldn't wanna get kicked in the mouth from tickling a horse either.」

％Ｂ
「...And that would be a correct use of that phrase.」
all
Marika
「The lights will now be turning off～」
all
The room goes dark.
％Ｂ
「I'm gonna light them.」
Sora
「Ignition.」
I light the candles one by one with a utility lighter.
The candles form a gentle curve around the cake's perimeter.
But I stop lighting them halfway through.
The candles light up in the shape of...
Rikka
「Is this a heart?」
％Ｂ
「Sigh.」
So that's why they were enjoying themselves so much.
They never miss a chance to mess around, do they?
Misa
「Fufu. There is one tradition we must adhere to before blowing out the candles, yes?」
Okihara-senpai could only be referring to one thing.
Our happy a capella rendition of Happy Birthday fills the room.

Sora & Marika & Natsuki & Misa & Touko & ％Ｂ
「Happy birthday dear Rikkaaa... Happy birthday to you!」
We all applaud to celebrate after singing...
Rikka
「...」
But Narusawa just stares at the candles.
％Ｂ
「Narusawa. The candles.」
Rikka
「Oh... Mhm... Fhhh～」
The candles go out. More warm applause.
Narusawa doesn't know where to look with all of the attention on her. She just looks down at her lap.
She begins to speak slowly, as if she were carefully picking out her words.
Rikka
「U-Umm... Well... Thank you for today...」
Rikka
「Both of my parents are very busy... and I've never really been able to celebrate my birthday with them too much.」
Rikka
「It was just a phone call to celebrate this year too, and a present through the mail.」

Rikka
「Meguru was the only one who would celebrate with me... but that stopped too after she got busy with piano.」

Rikka
「This is the first time anyone other than Meguru's celebrated my birthday with me... so I'm a bit lost.」

Everyone's listening to her quietly.
Rikka
「That's always been normal... I haven't had a birthday party in a long time... I thought my birthday was going to pass the same way this year too.」

Rikka
「...I never thought it would be this bright, and happy... that so many people would celebrate it... that today would be so wonderful.」


Rikka
「I didn't know... that it would make me this happy to have my friends celebrate my birthday.」

Narusawa smiles in the darkened room.
Tears form in her eyes and glitter in the moonlight.
Rikka
「Um... I'm really happy... but the only words I can think of... are thank you...」
Rikka
「I know there's so much more I want to say... I'm sorry... I'm sorry...」

Drip.
The tears fall like gemstones from her eyes.
Rikka
「Fueh... uehhh... Why am I crying...?」
Rikka
「I should be happy... It's strange...gh, uuh... fhh...」
Rikka
「Hgh, uuh... Fuehh... fueeehhh...」
I've never seen her cry before.
She looks beautiful.
Marika
「Ehehe, I'm really happy that you feel that way, Narusawa-san.」

Natsuki
「You can cry as much as you want. I'll lend my chest for you to cry into.」
Misa
「Yes, there is no need for you to stop crying. Because those tears are very pretty ones.」

I don't think I have any place here, as a guy.
Narusawa's being comforted by Shinozaki, Segawa, Okihara-senpai, Ousaka, and Yukimura. The precious friends she's made at school.

She's a completely normal girl.
She laughs, she gets angry, she gets sad, she gets happy, she cries...
all
And...
And I...
Am in love with her. I don't think it's possible for me to love her more than I already do.
Once Narusawa's done crying, we all eat the cake and other food as if that hadn't happened at all.

We all have fun and enjoy each other's company.
We get a bit too loud.
We all clean up afterward together.
And we all start getting ready to go home once it's completely dark out.
Sora
「Zzz... Zzz... Mnyah, nh...」
Marika
「She's all tuckered out. It's... kinda cute.」

Ousaka fell asleep partway through. Yukimura's carrying her on her back.
％Ｂ
「You sure I don't need to come?」

Touko
「It'll be fiiine. Fluffyhead's super light.」
Natsuki
「I'll handle navigation!」
Marika
「I'll go with too. So don't worry, okay?」
Natsuki
「But you better put the table and couch back in exchange.」

all
They're still in the positions we moved them into to create space for the party.

I've been told to put them back since I'm the guy...
But I'm sure they're trying to be considerate by giving us some alone time.
I've made some incredibly good friends since coming back to this town.
％Ｂ
「Thanks. I'll leave it to you guys, then.」
Misa
「We will be taking our leave now, then. Thank you very much for inviting us today.」

Rikka
「And thank you for coming.」
all
Natsuki
「Mmfufuuuh. You better be prepared for a huge celebration next year. We'll come again.」
Marika
「See you, Narusawa-san!」
Rikka
「Yes. See you.」
all
％Ｂ
「Looks like they're gone. All right, time for me to do some work.」
Putting the room back in order―
And one more thing.
Rikka
「I'll help.」
％Ｂ
「It's fine. I can do this by myself.」
Rikka
「I want to help. Could you let me help you?」
％Ｂ
「Okay, hold that side, then.」
all
Narusawa and I carry the small couch back to its original position.
It's over in a flash with the two of us working together.
Now then... How do I begin?
I look at Narusawa.
She's leaning lightly on the grand piano in the corner of the room, looking down out the window.

There's no sign of the others at the entranceway.
Rikka
「...I'm a terrible woman. I never apologized to them.」
％Ｂ
「Apologize? You do something to them?」
Rikka
「I said something mean to them... even though they were the kind of people who would come to celebrate my birthday, and comfort me when I cry.」
Rikka
「When Okihara-senpai asked me if I knew your preferences...」
Rikka
「I could have just played it off, but I didn't want to lie. I ended up causing you trouble too.」

％Ｂ
「I wasn't really that bothered by it. Though I did think it wasn't like you.」

Rikka
「Okihara-senpai's pretty and has a big heart. Segawa-san's bright and sociable. Shinozaki-san's girly and cute, and she's your childhood friend on top of that...」


Rikka
「Yukimura-san and Ousaka-san too... They're all wonderful, aren't they?」
％Ｂ
「Hm? Yeah, they are. They're all good people.」
Rikka
「They all have something I don't. They're so attractive, it makes me jealous.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah. You're right, they do have things that you don't. But you know...」

But she probably doesn't need those things.
Because I know.
％Ｂ
「You've got things that only you've got too... And I know there's at least one person that thinks you're attractive that way.」

Rikka
「Wha...?」
The girl in front of me is so incredibly precious to me.
She always looked like she could accomplish anything. But now she's a frail, lonely girl who just wants to connect with others.

An incredibly awkward girl who can't communicate that well.

％Ｂ
「When I first saw you, I thought you always had this on-guard aura. I thought you were kinda hard to approach. I thought you might not like dealing with people.」
Rikka
「...」
％Ｂ
「But we went camping together, you joined the committee, you helped me with music...」

％Ｂ
「And I learned that you were really just an awkward girl who isn't that great at interacting with others.」

％Ｂ
「I saw you laugh normally, get angry, get sad, get happy, and blush when we were together.」

％Ｂ
「I realized you were a normal girl.」
Rikka
「How rude. I've always been one.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. You're a girl. You're a really cute girl.」
Rikka
「Wha... C-Cu...te...?」
Her shocked face gradually fills up with red from the bottom up.
I want Narusawa to know how I feel.
I want to tell her.
％Ｂ
「Narusawa...」
％Ｂ
「I... wanna celebrate your birthday with you. Next year, and the year after that, forever...」

Rikka
「...?」
％Ｂ
「I think it'd be great if we could all celebrate it together, of course, but I want to be able to have some time for us to celebrate it with just the two of us too.」

Rikka
「...What?」
％Ｂ
「I like you, Narusawa.」
Rikka
「...Huh?」
％Ｂ
「I said, I like you. I want to go out with you.」
Rikka
「...!!」
Claaaang!!
The keys beneath Narusawa's fingers make a loud, discordant sound.
％Ｂ
「That sounds exactly like one of those surprise sound effects.」
％Ｂ
「Agh! Is this a subtle way of rejecting me!?」
Is this a kinda lighthearted way of saying no that pianists do?
That's a pretty intense way of rejecting someone if that's the case...
Rikka
「N-No, it isn't! I am surprised, but I didn't mean it like that!」

Rikka
「It's because... you said something like that so suddenly...!」
She turns bright red, and her words are unsteady.
％Ｂ
「I know it was sudden, but I've been trying to show you how I feel for a while now. Like when I invited you out for today.」

Rikka
「I-I thought that might be the case... but it might've been just me misunderstanding, and I didn't expect you to say that so suddenly.」


Rikka
「I didn't have the time to prepare myself. This isn't fair!」
％Ｂ
「Your face is what's unfair, Narusawa. Seeing you like that's just gonna make me like you even more.」

Her face gets even redder. I feel like it might start emitting steam.

Rikka
「Gh, uuh... Uuuh...」
I can hear her moaning in embarrassment.
％Ｂ
「I'll wait as long as you want for an answer. You don't have to force yourself now.」
Rikka
「...No. You don't need to wait.」
Rikka
「I... like you too. I love you. This is the first time I've ever liked someone this much.」

Rikka
「I only thought of you as the classmate that sits next to me at first. I even thought you were a little annoying, and I wondered why you'd keep trying to talk to me.」


Rikka
「But I started to watch you more as I felt more of your kindness, and started to pay more attention to all the little things you did.」


Rikka
「I started thinking about you all the time, even when you weren't around me... Even when I was at home.」

Rikka
「My heart's come to always be filled with you. I...」
Rikka
「I... like you so much I don't think I'll ever be able to meet anyone who could make me feel the same way.」

％Ｂ
「Narusawa...」
Rikka
「So... I'd also like to ask you. Hino-kun... Please make me your most important person.」

Rikka
「So... I'd also like to ask you. Please... make me your most important person.」

％Ｂ
「Okay. I swear I'll treasure you.」
Rikka
「...I'm so happy... Hehe.」
I can see tears swimming in her eyes as she smiles.
％Ｂ
「Do you cry pretty easily?」
Rikka
「I don't. I just had a lot of things happen today that made me happy enough to cry.」

％Ｂ
「I see.」
She smiles bashfully and gently wipes away her tears.
And she looks up shyly at me.
Rikka
「Um... Can I... ask you for something?」
％Ｂ
「Hm?」
Rikka
「I want you to put the necklace you bought me today on me. I... want you to put it on me for the first time I wear it.」

％Ｂ
「Okay. I can do that.」
She hands me the moonstone-decorated silver necklace... "The gemstones that communicate love."

I put my hands behind her neck and fasten the cord.
The pearly-white gemstones shine against her pale skin.
Rikka
「...How... does it look?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. It's like I thought. It looks really good on you.」
Rikka
「It's because you bought it for me. I'll treasure it forever.」
％Ｂ
「Hearing that makes me happy I bought it for you.」
I'm done putting the necklace on her, but I can't really pull myself away from her.

I want to watch her smile more.
I want to listen to her gentle voice more.
I want to smell her sweet scent more... I can't hold back those thoughts.
She looks into my eyes. I look back into hers, gently grab her shoulders, and pull her closer.

I gently bring my lips closer―
Rikka
「...Ghhh～～～! W-W-W-Wait, wait a second, please!」
％Ｂ
「Oh...」
Rikka
「I, I-I, I can't...」
％Ｂ
「Sorry. That was too sudden... wasn't it...」
Rikka
「N-No... That's not it...」
Rikka
「Um... Don't... look at my face... I'm just too happy... I'm so embarrassed I don't know what to do with myself... I think I might just drop dead at any moment...!」


She looks down and away. Her face is so red I doubt it could get any redder.

Maybe it's because she's so embarrassed...
But my face is suddenly starting to feel hot too.
...Yeah. We can take this slowly, without rushing.
We've only just started dating. We have plenty of time.

％Ｂ
「I'll be in your care from now on.」
Rikka
「Likewise... I will also be in your care.」
We bashfully lower our heads to each other.
