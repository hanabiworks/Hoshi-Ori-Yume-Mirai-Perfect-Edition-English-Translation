Ishizuka
「All right all of you, good on you for comiiiiingg!!」
Crowd
「Yeaaaaahh!!」
Ishizuka
「Are you all puuuuuuumped!?」
Crowd
「Yeaaaaahhh!!」
Ishizuka
「I can't heeaaaar yoooouu!! Give me a waaaave, dammiiiittt!!」

Crowd
「Yeaaaaaahhhhhh!!!」
Ishizuka
「Don't you even freakin' think about missing this waaaaaaaaaaveeee!!」
Crowd
「Yeaaaaaaaaahhhh!!!」
Shionagi Academy's Tanabata Festival's finally begun.
It looks like things are noisy over at the Shio-cademy Fest stage too.
％Ｂ
「Didn't know Ishizuka-san got like that.」
There are always people whose personalities change from the excitement of a festival.

％Ｂ
「Rikka's doing her best behind that stage, isn't she?」
％Ｂ
「I'll have to do my best too, then!!」
％Ｂ
「Looks like we're getting a lot of visitors.」
Misa
「Yes! It's all thanks to Sora-san and Marika-san attracting them here!」

Misa
「And it appears the children especially like that moon headwear Sora-san made. They mentioned that Princess Kaguya told them to come here.」


％Ｂ
「That's one interpretation of Princess Kaguya, I guess...」
all
She's talking about that realistic model of the moon that Ousaka made.
We were planning on putting it up on display, but we decided to have Shinozaki wear it since it'd probably garner some more interest that way.

A girl with the moon for a head... The person wearing that moon's a lot more like Princess Kaguya without it, if you ask me.

Touko
「Heeey! No running indoors! Or I'll do this!」

Boy C
「Aagh!? Stooop, lemme gooo!」
Touko
「Ahaha, you're not getting away!」
Yukimura's playing around with some kids who came to see the display.
all
％Ｂ
「Yukimura's unexpectedly good at dealing with kids, isn't she?」
Misa
「She's very helpful. I wouldn't be able to do quite as well myself.」

％Ｂ
「It looks like we'll be able to get lots of people to see the wonders of Shionagi's sea and stars at this rate.」

Misa
「And we still have the illumination show that Rikka-san proposed in the afternoon too. It seems things will be getting busy, ufufu!」

She looks absolutely ecstatic.
Seeing her this happy makes me glad we put in all that time and effort for today.

Girl A
「Onee-chan, what kind of fish is thiiis?」
Misa
「Oh, this would be a Japanese dragonet of the order Perciformes!」
Girl A
「Perci...for...? It's a fish but it's also a dragon? That's weeeird.」
Misa
「Please look here. It's closed at the moment, but this fin on its back can open up like a dragon's wings.」


Okihara-senpai neatly explains the fish to the curious girl.

It reminds me of back when she guided me through Marinpia Shionagi.
She really loves the ocean, from the bottom of her heart...
I can really tell when I watch her at work like this.
％Ｂ
「Senpai, I'll go try to attract visitors too. And I'm sorry, but...」
Misa
「Meguru-san has her performance, yes? Please enjoy.」
Meguru-chan's asked me to come watch her.
％Ｂ
「Thank you very much. I'll be stepping out for just a little bit. I'll work hard afterward again!」


Misa
「Please do. We will also come to watch Rikka-san and Meguru-san's performance.」

％Ｂ
「Okay. I'll let them know.」
all
Meguru
「Uuuh～ ...I'm starting to get nervous.」
That's not something I'm used to hearing from Meguru.

Rikka
「Hehe. What are you saying? You're usually totally fine playing in front of more than five thousand people. You've always been good at dealing with pressure, haven't you?」


Meguru
「I'm fine when I'm playing alone. But playing together with you is really special.」

Rikka
「It is for me too, hehe.」
There's a new world for me that I might be able to come to see after playing together with Meguru.

I wonder what I'll be able to find there.
Maybe I've already found it... and I just want to form that into an answer.
Handicrafts Club President
「Meguru-chan, let's get started on your changing and makeup.」
Meguru
「Okaaay! I'll be going, Onee-chan.」
Rikka
「Mhm. Have fun.」
all
Rikka
「...I'm not one to talk, am I?」
I'm incredibly nervous.
But it's not because of any kind of pressure. It's something like excitement. It feels like my blood's simmering in my veins.

I want it to be time already.
I think the mood's affected me. It may be of all various genres, but we're all here because we love music.

My heart's been beating out an excited, comfortable rhythm this whole time.
Rikka
「Group number 16. The group before you has almost finished performing, so please be on standby here.」

First-Year Girl D
「O-Okay!」
A group of girls carrying guitars and bass guitars runs over. They look nervous.

Rikka
「Try saying, "I can do this," ten times out loud.」
First-Year Girl D
「Wha?」
Rikka
「It's a way of relaxing I used to use a lot before performing. Let's see... I also would tell myself that it wasn't like I would die from messing up.」


First-Year Girl D
「Aha, you're right. I won't die from messing up.」
First-Year Girl D
「I can do this, I can do this, I can do this, I can do this, I can do this...」

She repeats it ten times like I said.
First-Year Girl D
「Oh! I'm not as nervous now!」
Rikka
「That's great. Have fun.」
First-Year Girl D
「I will!」
Saying "Do your best" to someone who's nervous is only going to put them under more pressure.

Because they're the ones who know better than anyone that they have to do their best.
Rikka
「Group 15. When the group before you finishes playing, they'll exit through the other side of the stage. But please don't run out right away, and wait for our signal.」

Rikka
「And once your performance is over, please exit through the opposite side like the group before you.」
Second-Year Girl D
「We understand!」
Rikka
「Thank you very much.」
I peer onto the stage and compare the time to my detailed program schedule, for timekeeping purposes.

We're about on schedule at the moment.
It looks like the audience is enjoying things too.
Rikka
「Oh...!」
I spot someone familiar in the audience.
Why are they here? ...But the answer's easy enough to guess.
Their expression tells me everything I need to know.
Rikka
「...」
Rikka
「I'm sorry, but could I ask you to take over the timekeeping for a minute?」

Event Committee Member E
「Need to go to the bathroom? Sure thing. I'll take over.」
Rikka
「Thank you very much.」
I check the time.
％Ｂ
「I got here a bit too early...」
But it's better than being late.
％Ｂ
「But it looks like people are having a good time here...」
The rough vocals tremble through my brain, and the bass resonates through my guts.
The crowd leaps in time to the cheerful melody.
There's an incredible sense of unity here.
％Ｂ
「It'd be great if we could get this many people for the Shionagi Friends display.」
I'll have to work hard to attract visitors for that to happen.
It'll be just in time for the big illumination show if I try to get people to come after listening to Meguru-chan's performance.

％Ｂ
「I wish I could go backstage and see Rikka, but she's probably pretty busy right now...」

_00cutinBS
％Ｂ
「...Hm? Wait... Rikka?」
I couldn't ever mistake her for someone else.
That's definitely Rikka cutting through the crowds.
She parts her way through the crowd and stops before someone.

_00cutinBS
％Ｂ
「Isn't that...?」
It's too loud here for me to hear what they're saying. I can only watch their expressions.

But Rikka looks...
％Ｂ
「I wonder what they're talking about...」
Rikka
「Asakura-senpai.」
Asakura
「You're... from the event committee...」
Rikka
「I'm Narusawa. I saw you from backstage, and something seemed a little off, so...」

Asakura
「Ahaha, really now～ You saw something a bit shameful.」
Rikka
「This is about performing for the Shio-cademy Fest, isn't it?」
Asakura
「I already know I'm just clinging at this point. But I just didn't want to give up that easily. Even though I already know me being here won't change a thing...」
Rikka
「...Um... May I ask a question?」
Asakura
「What's that?」
Rikka
「Why did your drummer leave the group and then come back?」

Asakura
「Chise... Oh, that's our drummer's name. You see, Chise... didn't want it to be the end.」

Rikka
「The end?」
Asakura
「We've been playing together in a band since we met in middle school. We've been together for a long time. But we're third years in high school now. We'll all go on to university or start working next year.」
Asakura
「Everyone in our band's going their separate ways, and one of us is planning on going somewhere pretty far. We won't be able to see each other that often, right?」
Asakura
「It'll be hard to keep doing this band stuff too. We might not be able to do it at all anymore. That's why I wanted to play here at the Shio-cademy Fest, as a final curtain call for us.」
Asakura
「Everyone was okay with that too at first. But Chise suddenly started crying about how she didn't want to do it.」
Rikka
「Because... she thought that this performance would be the last for sure.」
Asakura
「Yeah... Chise was kind of a shut-in back in middle school, so she didn't have many friends. That's when she met us.」

Asakura
「The band was Chise's connection to us... her bond with us.」
Asakura
「I tried to tell her, "Nothing's going to change between us even if we stop playing in the band," but then I didn't really have an answer for her when she responded by asking if that was really going to be true.」

Rikka
「...」
Asakura
「The band's always been the core of our group, and... I wondered if we'd be connected in the same way with that gone... I got scared.」
Rikka
「...Yes. It's scary to have something that was central to your life disappear.」
It's like you're not yourself anymore.
Like a huge gaping hole's opened up in you.
It's not something that's easily filled...
And the wind that blows through that gap is so incredibly cold.
Asakura
「But it's not like that means us not doing anything's going to keep things the same in the future, right?」

Asakura
「I... wanted to know. What's waiting for us after this final live show? How are we going to feel? I wanted to learn with everyone.」
Asakura
「And if things still changed, then we can just rethink things at that point... Like that.」

Rikka
「You're very strong, Asakura-senpai.」
Asakura
「Ahaha! I'm a total wimp. I'm the leader, but I don't really have that kind of a personality.」
Asakura
「If I were really strong, then I would've just said, "We'll always be together, no matter how far apart we are, even without the band. Believe in me!" and pulled everyone along with me without even letting them say no.」
I think those kinds of leaders exist too.
But if they're not taking other people's opinions and thoughts into account... then they're just forcing other people to do what they want.

Asakura-senpai isn't like that. She was thinking for everyone's sake... and tried to come up with an answer with them in mind.

Rikka
「You're definitely strong. I think you have a strong heart... and you're very kind.」
Asakura
「Thanks.」
Asakura
「I really wanted to do my best and just charge through for this too～ Chise said she wanted to try again too... but I couldn't do it in the end.」

Asakura
「All that came of it was I got everyone's hopes up and got them even more disappointed about it. I'm a failure as a leader.」

Rikka
「That's not true. You're an excellent leader, Asakura-senpai. Everything you did was for the sake of your friends.」

Rikka
「...I understand how it feels to not be able to play together with someone. In my case, I ran away, and it took me a very long time before I could tell her...」
The regret you feel, about how this might be the end... how you might not be able to make your dreams come true...

It'll sit there as a lump inside you forever.
You'll always be looking back at that past with that regret.
I know that painfully well.
Rikka
「...」
I... don't want Asakura-senpai to know how that feels.
I'm a member of the event committee...
So if I have the ability to save her from those feelings...
Rikka
「Um... I have a suggestion.」
Rikka told me she wanted to talk about something for a bit after Meguru-chan's performance.
With me, Shinozaki, Segawa, Okihara-senpai, Ousaka, Yukimura, Shuuichi, Meguru-chan...
And also, the other event committee members, and even the president of the handicrafts club.
Natsuki
「This is a lot of people we've got here. What are we gonna talk about with all these people?」

all
％Ｂ
「...」
I think I more or less have an idea.
Judging by Rikka's expression, and the fact that it was Asakura-senpai she was speaking with...
Rikka
「I'm sorry! I want to cancel my performance with Meguru!」

Marika
「Wha, wha, whaaat～!?」
Natsuki
「Wait, what's going on here!?」
Everyone's shocked, but I'm strangely calm.
...And so is Meguru-chan.

Meguru
「You have a reason for this, don't you, Onee-chan?」
She looks right into Rikka's eyes.
There isn't even a hint of accusal in her expression. She doesn't think Rikka's trying to escape playing with her again.

Rikka
「Mhm. I still want to play with you. But... I can play with you again whenever we have the time, right?」


Rikka
「There are people who might have to part ways without expressing their feelings properly if they don't get to perform today... and I want those people to take to the stage.」


Sora
「So you're giving up your place?」
Rikka nods silently.
all
Natsuki
「Who's that? And how do you know them?」

Rikka
「Asakura-senpai, a third year. I don't really know her. I've just talked to her a few times.」

all
Touko
「I know this is going to sound kinda rude, but I don't think you're under any obligation to give up your place for someone you barely even know. This is an important performance for you, isn't it?」


Rikka
「Mhm... It's very important.」
Touko
「Then...」
all
Rikka
「It's important... and that's why I can sympathize painfully well with how they feel.」
Misa
「Rikka-san...」
Shuuichi
「Hm.」
Meguru
「...」
Silence falls for a moment.
No one speaks up.
It seems like everyone's waiting for someone else to speak.
all
％Ｂ
「I'm with Rikka on this one.」
Natsuki
「Do you even understand what she's suggesting!?」
％Ｂ
「I do. Rikka went out of her way to tell us how she feels like this 'cause she thinks doing this'll make all of our support for her go to waste.」
％Ｂ
「That's just how strongly Rikka feels about this. So I want to respect those feelings.」

Natsuki
「That's true, but...」
％Ｂ
「I know that you've always been worried about Rikka, and you've always watched over her. Thanks.」

Natsuki
「...Why do I need you thanking me for that?」
％Ｂ
「You don't. But as her boyfriend, I'm glad she has friends who value her like that.」

I smile, and Segawa sighs in exasperation.
Natsuki
「Sigh... Well, if you guys are okay with it, then there's nothing for me to say.」
all
％Ｂ
「Meguru-chan. I know you're disappointed about this. But could you respect Rikka's feelings on the matter?」

Meguru
「Hehe. I already know my answer. I feel the same way she does.」

Meguru
「I'm already happy... just from getting to practice together with Onee-chan for today, getting to sit next to her without any reservations to play the piano.」


Meguru
「Let's play again sometime, Onee-chan.」

Rikka
「Thank you, Meguru.」
Rikka smiles warmly at Meguru-chan, and then looks at us.
all
Rikka
「I've become able to play with confidence because of all of your support.」
Rikka
「I would never have felt this way if I hadn't met all of you. Thank you all... so very much!」

Rikka
「I'm so sorry... for bringing the stage you've all prepared for me... for bringing all of your efforts to waste like this!」

She bows her head low to express her gratitude and apology.
No one says anything.
Everyone's looking at Rikka with warm, kind eyes.
Ishizuka-san, who's been MCing the Shio-cademy Fest, was shocked at first, but took it in stride.

Ishizuka
「We've got some reeeeall funky girls' rock to finish off our show!! World End Dungeon!!」
Crowd
「Yeaaaaaaaaaahhh!!!」
And so...
The curtain falls on the Shio-cademy Fest amidst thunderous applause...
％Ｂ
「What the hell!? No! I don't want it to end like this!」
I respect Rikka's feelings, and I thought it was the right thing to do. 
But I'm not enough of a saint to give up on things just like that.

I know exactly how much effort Rikka's put into everything for today.
％Ｂ
「I gotta think! ...There's gotta be a way to do this!」
I won't let things end this way!
％Ｂ
「Shuuichi! I need a favor!」
Shuuichi
「...What is it? I'm guessing you're trying to cause trouble again, from the looks of it?」
％Ｂ
「You bet I am! I've got the worst, most unreasonable demand ever for you!」
Shuuichi
「Hoh. And it's something that'll be hard for me to accomplish too, then?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, it's gonna be hellish. I dunno if even you'll be able to pull this one off.」

Shuuichi
「Hmph, interesting. I love a good challenge. Ku, ku, ku.」
％Ｂ
「Let's see you try. Ku, ku, ku.」
Now that the Fest's over, the stage is being used for the after-festival.
The stage that Rikka and Meguru-chan were supposed to be on.
Rikka
「You wanted to talk? Did something happen?」
Rikka comes last.
I had the rest of the Shionagi Friends, Shuuichi, and Meguru-chan all assemble beforehand.

％Ｂ
「You sure you're fine with things ending today without getting to perform?」
Rikka
「Oh... But it's not like I can do anything...」
％Ｂ
「What if we told you we'd do something about it?」
Rikka
「Wha... Can you...? The Shio-cademy Fest's over already. There's no room in the program for the after-festival either.」


％Ｂ
「Yeah. Normally, it'd be impossible.」
Rikka
「Normally...? Are you trying to do something crazy again? I won't let you do something like that for my sake.」

％Ｂ
「...」
That's exactly what I thought she'd say.
％Ｂ
「You won't let us do anything crazy?」
Rikka
「Of course not. Because you're all precious to me.」
％Ｂ
「Precious... Is that what that really means?」
Rikka
「What do you mean...?」
I've thought this for a while now.
Rikka's "too kind."

Sora
「Ritsu, you played "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star" for us. Wasn't that crazy for you?」

Rikka
「Th-That's...」
Sora
「We can't be missing any pieces. It's all connected.」
Ousaka thrusts out her phone...
With the Saturn strap swinging below it.
％Ｂ
「Yeah. We're all connected.」
all
Sora
「...*nod*」

Misa
「That's right.」
Okihara-senpai pulls out her phone to hold up her Neptune strap.
Marika
「Yeah!」
Shinozaki and her Uranus strap.
all
Natsuki
「I like this! Things are getting exciting!」
Touko
「This is cool! It's like we're Power Rangers!」
Mars and Jupiter are added to the mix.
all
％Ｂ
「Here, Rikka. You too.」
I hold my phone with the Sun strap in one hand, and take Rikka by the arm in the other.
Rikka
「Oh...」
％Ｂ
「It's okay to be selfish.」
Rikka
「Wha... Sel...fish?」
％Ｂ
「We want you to depend on us more. We want you to be more selfish.」

Rikka
「I am. So much that I'm worried I might be causing you trouble.」
％Ｂ
「But you're not causing us trouble, are you? I think you're holding yourself back subconsciously.」

Rikka
「...!」
She likes us, so she doesn't want us to come to hate her.
It's an incredibly normal way to feel. It's heartwarming, but at the same time saddening.

％Ｂ
「It's okay to cause us trouble. No, it's more like we want you to cause us trouble by depending on us and being selfish. As much as you want.」
％Ｂ
「No holding back. We're all friends. We can do our best if it's for a friend. We can put our all into anything, no matter how crazy it is.」
Misa
「I would like to be of aid to you too, Rikka-san, after you have helped me with so much.」

all
Sora
「Your "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star" was really pretty. I want to help you too.」
all
Marika
「I was wondering if you could teach me piano sometime.」

Touko
「You're the only Piano-chan I have. And if you're Piano-chan, then I want you to be amazing.」

all
Natsuki
「C'mon, Rikka. Fess up already.」
all
％Ｂ
「Rikka.」
I grin at her.
％Ｂ
「Tell us how you really feel. Let us hear the voice of your heart.」
Rikka
「Ah...gh... gh... uuh... uuuh.」
Clink.
Her phone makes a small sound as it comes out from her pocket.
Her phone with the Venus strap.
Rikka
「...with her.」
Rikka
「I wanted to play together with Meguru!! I really, really wanted to play with her!!」

Rikka
「I want to play!! On that stage!! Please! Everyone! Help me do this!!」
all
The rest of us all look at each other and grin.
Sora & Marika & Natsuki & Misa & Touko
「Of course we will!」
all
Meguru
「Umm～ ...Excuse me. What are those?」
Meguru-chan hesitantly raises her hand and points at our straps.

％Ｂ
「Oh yeah, you weren't here when we got these.」
％Ｂ
「We're the Shionagi Friends... This is kinda like proof that we're always connected, I guess.」
Meguru
「Really. I'm a little jealous.」
Shuuichi
「...Hm? I don't have one of those either.」
Meguru
「Um! May I also be included in that group, even without one of those?」

Meguru
「I would also like to help Onee-chan... No, I want to play together with Onee-chan!」

％Ｂ
「Yeah. Let's do our best together.」

Sora
「...We have the final planets now.」
Ousaka pulls out the Mercury strap.
Right, we had some left over.
...Wait, what? She's had those on her this whole time?
Meguru
「Is it okay for me to have this?」
Sora
「...*nod* You're a Shionagi Friend too, Megu. Mercury, also known as Hermes, is a messenger... You came to deliver your feelings. Mercury is also a god of music.」

She hands Meguru-chan the Mercury strap.
Meguru
「Thank you very much! I'll always, always treasure this! Ehehe!」

all
She immediately attaches the strap to her phone and shows it to us.
all
Shuuichi
「Uh... Don't I get one?」

Sora
「No.」
Shuuichi
「Th-That's kinda mean, don't you think!?」
Sora
「Kidding. This is the last one.」
Shuuichi
「It's Earth. What does it mean that I'm getting this one?」
Sora
「Leftovers.」
Shuuichi
「There's no meaning!?」
all
％Ｂ
「Anyway, back on subject. Shuuichi and I went to go get permission to use the stage after the after-festival.」

％Ｂ
「We didn't get it.」
Natsuki
「What the heck!? So we failed right away!?」
I was thinking we might be able to extend things just a little longer, but the ending time's apparently strictly controlled by the school.

％Ｂ
「Well, let me finish.」
％Ｂ
「We got a no at first, but we did get a conditional okay.」
all
Shuuichi and I were so stubborn that the teachers ended up compromising with us.

Misa
「What would that condition be?」
％Ｂ
「We have to get permission from every resident in the area so we won't get any noise complaints. We have until 8 p.m.」

The school's rule for the ending time is linked to its mutual trust with the nearby residents.
Because of possible noise complaints, we'll have to get permission from all people who could possibly be affected by the noise if we want to break the established rule.



Natsuki
「Every...!? I know there aren't many houses around here, but that's still a ton of people!」

Segawa's right. There may not be any big apartment complexes around here, but there are small apartments and houses scattered throughout the area.
Running around to get permission from all of those people would be too crazy even for us.

％Ｂ
「But our chances aren't zero.」
all
Touko
「It's really close to zero.」
％Ｂ
「Right.」

Misa
「It's currently about 5:30, so if one considers the time to perform a piece, we have less than two and a half hours...」
Sora
「No one will be here if we're late in getting the permission too.」
The after-festival continues until 7:30.
We're supposed to all leave school by eight.
all
Marika
「There wouldn't be any point if the students all leave... which means we maybe have less than two hours to do it...」


Shuuichi
「This is sounding harder and harder...」
all
％Ｂ
「Segawa, Yukimura, could you go around and let the other students know? Tell them there's gonna be a piano four hands concert at the outdoor concert stage at end of the after-festival party.」

Touko
「Are you sure? That's only going to make more work for you guys. We're already short on people as it is.」

％Ｂ
「If we're gonna do it, then we want lots of people interested in going, right? I'll do everything I can to get permission so we can start at 7:30, on the dot.」


Natsuki
「Then we'll gather enough people to fill the audience!」
％Ｂ
「Counting on you!」
all
Things are looking tough, though.
I dunno if we'll actually be able to get through the entire surrounding area with this many people...

Ishizuka
「We'll help you with that too.」
Rikka
「Ishizuka-san...!?」
Handicrafts Club President
「I'd feel sorry for my crowning work if it never got to see the light of day.」
Rikka
「Even you...」
It's the members of the concert team and the handicrafts club.
They all came because they wanted to help Rikka.
Handicrafts Club President
「I think this might be enough for us to get through everything in time♪」
Ishizuka
「Fufu. I'm pretty good at negotiations. I'll get the permission in a snap.」

Ishizuka
「Let's definitely put on this concert!」
Handicrafts Club President
「Two beautiful girls putting on an elegant performance up on stage, wearing my clothes... Aaahh～ Just imagining it gets me going! I'd get a high-pressure nosebleed if I saw it in the flesh!」


Rikka
「Tha...Thank you, very much...」
Rikka's already tearing up.
I pat her on the head.
％Ｂ
「You can't cry just yet.」
Rikka
「Mhm... You're right.」
She wipes away her tears and faces everyone.
She looks at each and every face.
At everyone who's come here for her sake.
We all know what she's about to say.
Rikka
「Everyone! I'm counting on you!!」
all
With Rikka's voice as our signal, we―the Shionagi Friends―all disperse running.

For the sake of a single, important goal.
％Ｂ
「Now that I think about it, Shuuichi, don't you have any committee work or anything?」
Shuuichi
「It's all just miscellaneous stuff they don't need me for. I'm letting the vice-chair handle it.」

％Ｂ
「Oh, okay. Thanks, man.」
Shuuichi
「Genuine thanks? Disgusting. So how about we compete to see who can get all their permissions first?」


％Ｂ
「You sure? You've been out of shape lately 'cause of all the committee work, right?」
Shuuichi
「I ran ten kilometers easily back when I played soccer. I may be out of shape, but I won't lose to you.」

％Ｂ
「Sorry, but I won't lose either. 'Cause I've got my Venus. So yeah, you're on.」

Shuuichi
「I like that spirit!」
all
％Ｂ & Shuuichi
「Uoooooooohhhhh!!」
Misa
「―And so may we receive permission to do so?」
Neighborhood Mom
「I don't mind. I always enjoy going to that Tanabata Festival with my son.」

Neighborhood Mom
「Is it okay if we attend too?」
Misa
「Of course! Please do!」
Neighborhood Granny
「Whah? What's that?」
Marika
「Well, umm... What I said is... it may be a bit noisy, but we would like a signature for permission to put on a nighttime concert for our Tanabata Festival.」

Neighborhood Granny
「Put on... Put on what?」
Marika
「A-A nighttime concert for our Tanabata Festival for Shionagi Academy. Please. We would like our friend to be able to perform.」

Neighborhood Granny
「Hohoh, for a friend... That's an admirable thing. You should have just said so, then. I just write my name here, do I?」


Marika
「Yes! Thank you very much!」
Guy's Girlfriend
「Mamoruuu～ Are you dooone～?」
Sora
「...Please.」
Neighborhood Guy
「She says they wanna do it no matter what. You said it was piano? Is that gonna be loud?」

Sora
「...Pretty.」
Guy's Girlfriend
「Why not, if it's pretty?」
Sora
「Thanks.」
Neighborhood Old Man
「Fuooohh～ ...There, that's it. Aaah～ ...Now that feels good...」
Shuuichi
「Thank you very much! I'm quite good at shoulder rubs, as I was very much a grandfather-loving child!」

Shuuichi
「Ssh! Ssh! Ssh! Ssh! Ssh! Ssh! ...And so what would your response be?」

Neighborhood Old Man
「It's fine by me～ While we're at it. I want to see it as well. Think you can help an old man over there?」

Shuuichi
「I will lead the way!」
Meguru
「Please! I want to play no matter what! I don't know when the next opportunity will be if we don't play today! Please!!」


Neighborhood Girl
「Oh... I feel like I've seen you somewhere before... Oh, it was this month's issue of "Dunamic." You were the feature, weren't you?」

Meguru
「Yes! Thank you very much for reading that.」
Neighborhood Girl
「I also play the flute. I'm just in the Shionagi Wind Symphony though, so I'm nothing compared to you.」

Meguru
「That's not true at all. I think we're all equals who love music.」

Neighborhood Girl
「Hehe. It almost sounds like you're making fun of me to hear that from you.」
Meguru
「I-I'm sorry!」
Neighborhood Girl
「You don't have to apologize like that. That was just me being jealous. I'm just glad that I have the opportunity to play music.」

Neighborhood Girl
「Here's my signature. That's what you needed, right? I'll come listen too.」

Meguru
「Thank you very much!!」
Asakura
「Oh!? Oh? Narusawa-san?」
I turn around to see Asakura-senpai behind me.
There are other girls with guitar cases on their backs.
These must be Asakura-senpai's band members.
They must be about to go home.
Asakura
「Thanks so much for today. I can't even begin to tell you just how grateful I am to you, Narusawa-san.」

Asakura
「That live show was really refreshing. We talked things over, and we decided to keep doing this even if we end up only getting to meet up occasionally after graduating. It's all because we were able to play today.」
Rikka
「Oh really. Hehe, I'm glad.」
Asakura
「Yeah. It's all thanks to you!」
Asakura
「Really... I'm sorry. I didn't know that show was that important for you.」

Asakura-senpai asked me why I was running around. She apologized to me when I told her.

Rikka
「Oh no, I was the one who chose to give up my spot... And besides... all of my friends are doing their best right now.」

Rikka
「I'm very happy right now. I feel like... my heart's been filled up. So, so much...」
Asakura
「You've got some good band members.」
Rikka
「I do!」
Asakura
「I just sign this paper here, right? Signey-sign～ Okay. Here!」
Asakura
「And here, give me a few of those. I know the area around here, so I think I can help out.」

Asakura-senpai's apparently lived around here for a long time, and has a good feel for how things are laid out.
Rikka
「...Are you sure?」
Asakura
「It's more like I wanna help, I think. Oh, I wanna repay you too, but I just kinda wanted to help you when I saw you trying so hard.」
Rikka
「Thank you very much! I'll be counting on you!」
％Ｂ
「Dammit... It's already past seven... and I've still got over half of them left to go.」

Going to each and every house individually is a lot more work than I thought.
I'm just glad that everyone I've explained things to has been cooperative.

Maybe it's just that the people around here are nice and considerate.
Knowing that makes me really happy.
％Ｂ
「I won't lose to something like this!」
I'm definitely gonna make sure Rikka and Meguru-chan's concert's a success!!
Rikka
「Ryousuke!!」
Rikka
「Oh!!」
％Ｂ
「Rikka...?」
Rikka
「I'll help!」
％Ｂ
「You managed to finish yours?」
Shuuichi and I may have taken the bulk of the quotas for ourselves, but it's still way too early for her to be finished.

Rikka
「I've gotten all my signatures. I ran into Asakura-senpai on the way, and she and her band helped me. Asakura-senpai and her friends left to go help Nirasawa-kun.」


％Ｂ
「Really. Asakura-senpai and her friends.」
I'm sure they wouldn't have helped if it weren't for Rikka.
It's true that we wouldn't be doing this in the first place if she hadn't given up her spot, but I think this is a good outcome too.

There are lots of people that have formed a circle together, with Rikka at the center.
％Ｂ
「That'd be great. Here, could you do these ones, then?」
Rikka
「Okay.」
all
She checks the addresses and starts running off.
I turn toward her and...
％Ｂ
「Rikka! I love you!!」
Rikka
「...Hgh. Wh-Why yell in a place like this out of nowhere like that? ...It's embarrassing.」

％Ｂ
「What about you, Rikka?」
Rikka
「I love you too, of course. I love you so much!」
％Ｂ
「All right! I can keep going!! Let's hold this concert for sure!!」

Rikka
「Mhm!!」
Natsuki
「It's 7:45... I don't think we'll be able to stop them from leaving for any longer.」
The lights have dimmed on the stage after the after-festival.
Segawa and Yukimura are still trying to get people to come to the concert.
But they can't stop the students from wanting to go home.
It's only a small minority that's waiting out of interest.
There are people within that minority who aren't students, who appear to be local residents.
They were probably people whom the others managed to ask to come while they were getting permission.
Knowing that helped motivate them, but they were almost at their limit for holding the students there.
Natsuki
「...What the heck are they doing... Hurry up and get those signatures already!」
all
％Ｂ
「Segawa! Yukimura! Sorry for the wait!!」
Natsuki
「You're late!」

Touko
「How'd it go!?」
all
I show them the stacks of paper I've got.
Every single one's got a signature.
This is the result of all our hard work.
Natsuki
「We will now begin a special one-piece concert by Narusawa Rikka and Narusawa Meguruuu!」
Segawa's voice cuts through the noise.
Natsuki
「Those of you who would like to spend the final moments of our Tanabata Festival with friends or a lover! Please, come listen!」
all
First-Year Girl A
「It's a concert by Narusawa-senpai! She's so pretty and cool. I'm actually a big fan of hers.」
First-Year Girl B
「People are saying it was her live performance that was playing over the speakers the other day.」
First-Year Girl C
「Really? That sounded so pretty～」
A portion of the students stop walking.
They join the group waiting for the concert.
Segawa and Yukimura sink down to the ground after seeing that.
％Ｂ
「Great work.」
Natsuki
「I'm crazy tired!」

Touko
「It would've been nice if you had been just a bit quicker, I think. Ahaha, but it was fun.」

％Ｂ
「Thanks, you two.」
They give me tired smiles in response.
The night sky's full of stars.
It's almost 8 p.m., but there are still people here in the audience.

I can see both students and local residents.
The latter are the people who were interested in coming after we petitioned them for signatures.
...But.
It's still up to them whether they'll listen or not.
We can't force them to do anything.
Marika
「Oh no... But we tried so hard...」
There are people walking into the school building to get ready to go home, and people grabbing their bags to leave...

Shinozaki watches them sadly.
％Ｂ
「We can't do anything about this.」
all
Rikka
「This is an amazing stage that you all stuffed your feelings into for us. Just getting to be on that stage at all is like something out of a dream.」

Rikka and Meguru-chan have changed into their dresses.
Meguru
「I swear to make this my best performance yet! Senpai, please listen!」

％Ｂ
「Yeah. I'll be watching from the audience.」
Meguru
「Let's go, Onee-chan.」
Rikka
「Okay.」
all
She turns toward us at the foot of the stage stairs.
Rikka
「Ryousuke... Everyone... Here I go.」
Rikka
「Everyone... Here I go.」
Sora & Marika & Natsuki & Misa & Touko
「Good luck!」
Rikka
「...」
Meguru
「...」
The two of them exhale quietly in unison and assume their playing postures.
We silently focus on every movement they make up on stage.
Four hands at the ready on the keys.
There are no words. No glances.
But it's obvious that the two of them are perfectly in step with one another.
Rikka & Meguru
「...」
_ef_ryusen03
_ef_ryusen04
Meguru-chan's fingers begin their elegant dance.
Rikka adds her own dance, and the tandem performance begins.
It's like a completed work of art.
Natsuki
「...」
Segawa...
Marika
「...」
Shinozaki...
Sora
「...」
Ousaka...
Misa
「...」
Okihara-senpai...
Touko
「...」
Yukimura...
Shuuichi
「...」
Shuuichi...
％Ｂ
「...」
And I...
All of the students who waited for this performance...
And all of the people who were interested in coming after we asked them for signatures...

...Are all lost in the sight. We've forgotten to even draw breath.
Everything becomes one.
％Ｂ
「Oh...」
It's like a miracle―
No. I'm sure it was inevitable.
One person turns around.
Then another. And another.
They stop walking, and look at the stage.
Entranced by the beautiful song being spun by the two Loreleis.
The two of them dance happily, alone in the stillness of the world.
They converse through the intersections and overlappings of their sound.
It's a much more precise form of communication than words for the two of them.
Something glitters.
A droplet of liquid streaks down Rikka's cheeks.
She just can't help but cry.
On this stage that's been stuffed with all of our feelings.
It's like a shooting star that's fallen down from the heavens.
The most beautiful tears I've seen yet.
Rikka
（Meguru.）
Meguru
（What is it?）
Rikka
（Playing piano is fun. It's so much fun.）
Meguru
（Mhm!）
The melody that's bloomed this Tanabata...



Rises higher and higher... Reaching all the way to the Milky Way above.
