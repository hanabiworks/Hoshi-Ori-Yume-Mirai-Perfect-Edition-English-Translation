The next day.
Okihara-senpai, Shinozaki, Segawa, and I have come back to the same tide pool.

Okihara-senpai's brought a fine net made out of soft material for catching the fish.

Misa
「Please be gentle when you catch them. Scoop them up gently, so you don't injure them.」

Marika
「Okaaay.」
...And I already knew it'd happen, but Okihara-senpai's wearing a swimsuit. Though she is wearing a rash guard.

I'm trying to look away and not stare directly at her, but that just makes it easier to catch sight of Shinozaki and Segawa's swimsuits.

Shinozaki's wearing a hoodie, but Segawa's wearing just her swimsuit.
Is it just me, or is this an enormous side benefit to what I'm doing...?
Misa
「And please take the utmost care to watch where you walk so you don't get hurt.」

Natsuki
「So she says.」
％Ｂ
「...I know.」
Misa
「The sun is bright today, and it's very hot. It's important to rehydrate frequently to prevent developing heatstroke.」

Natsuki
「"The sun's dazzling, but Okihara-senpai in her swimsuit's dazzling too..." is what you're thinking, right?」

％Ｂ
「Okihara-senseeei, Segawa-san's being distracting.」
Natsuki
「What are you snitching on me for?」
Misa
「Fufu... And let's all get along. Now then, let's begin the collection!」

all
We all then spread out to start catching fish.
％Ｂ
「Now then...」
I move to a spot a little further away, making sure no one notices.

I hide in the rocks and take a certain something out from my bag.
It's the secret weapon I built from the plastic bottles I got from Shinozaki yesterday.
％Ｂ
「I hope you work!」
I gently lower it into the water.
I head back toward the others after setting up my secret weapon.
％Ｂ
「How's it going, Shinozaki?」
Marika
「Mmm... I got one so far, see?」
I look inside her bucket. There's a small fish swimming around in it.
％Ｂ
「Oh, that's pretty good.」
Marika
「Ehehe, I guess so～」
％Ｂ
「How's Segawa doing?」
Marika
「Segawa-san's over there.」
all
I head over toward Segawa.
She's inside the water taking photos of the fish from above. Her net's been left on the rocks.

Natsuki
「That's gooood... You're all swimming so pretty!」
％Ｂ
「...What the heck are you doing?」
Natsuki
「Can't you tell? I'm taking photos.」
％Ｂ
「No, I meant... You should capture some fish instead of the moment.」
Natsuki
「You're not actually proud of that, are you?」
％Ｂ
「Gh... I didn't mean it as a joke. Our objective today's to catch fish, right?」

Natsuki
「I'll do that too. Afterward. Now then, could you guys look a little livelier when you swim for me?」

...Is she really gonna do it?
％Ｂ
「How are things going on your end, Okihara-senpai?」
Misa
「Yes, it's so-so.」
I peer into her bucket.
％Ｂ
「Whoa!? H-How many do you have in here?」
Misa
「Let's see... Seven... No, eight of them.」
％Ｂ
「Y-You've gotten this many already?」
Misa
「The tide pools over here just happened to be dense with fish.」

Wow...
I wonder if there's some kinda trick to it that only she knows...
Misa
「How are things going for you?」
％Ｂ
「Huh? ...Oh, well... N-None yet... I'm actually just walking around looking for a good tide pool...」

Crap.
I won't be able to complain about Segawa at this rate.
It'd be disgraceful if I couldn't catch a single one.
％Ｂ
「I-I'll do my best!」
Misa
「Yes! I'm looking forward to your results!」
all
％Ｂ
「Phew... So this makes three...」
I'm just glad I've gotten any at all...
％Ｂ
「But I don't see that one...」
None of the three I've caught are the yellowtail wrasse.
I've looked around at a few of the tide pools, but I wasn't able to spot it.

％Ｂ
「...Speaking of which, Okihara-senpai hasn't said anything about it.」
I haven't even heard a syllable along those lines since we met up this morning.
Even though we told each other yesterday that we'd come back here tomorrow to catch it...
Natsuki
「How's it going? Catch a few?」
all
Shinozaki and Segawa come over with their buckets.
％Ｂ
「Yeah... How about you?」
Natsuki
「Three for me.」
Marika
「I got five.」
I look inside their buckets.
％Ｂ
「...Yeah, it's not in there.」
Marika
「It?」
％Ｂ
「It's this fish called a yellowtail wrasse. It's got this deep-blue body with vivid blue spots near the tail.」

I pull out my phone and show them a photo of one that I got off the internet.

％Ｂ
「This one.」
Marika
「Wow, it's so pretty～」
Natsuki
「Is this the rare one that you were talking about yesterday?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. You apparently almost never see it around here.」
Marika
「Mmm... Yeah, I don't think I've seen a fish like this today...」
％Ｂ
「This guy'd be the real star of the show for the Tanabata Festival.」
Natsuki
「I like how that sounds. I definitely wanna get a shot of that one.」
％Ｂ
「No, I'm not talking photos, I mean the real thing...」
Natsuki
「I know. Anyway, we just need to catch this fish, right? I'd get to take some photos of it that way too.」

Marika
「Let's try looking for it, then.」
％Ｂ
「I don't think it's gonna be that easy...」
Natsuki
「Hmph... Just who do you think I am? Segawa Natsuki, a member of the grad-alb committee! I never let the models I'm aiming for escape!」


Marika
「You're so cool, Segawa-san!」
Natsuki
「It can be a yellowtail wrasse or a yellowpail rasp! Nothing escapes this lens! Let's go, Marika!」


Marika
「Okay!」
all
％Ｂ
「Wh-What's up with that drive...?」
They're not actually gonna end up finding the yellowtail wrasse, are they!?
Natsuki
「No dice...」
Marika
「We couldn't find anything like that～」
％Ｂ
「Okay... Well, I expected that...」
Misa
「Everyone, the tide will be rising soon, so we should start on our way out.」

Misa
「Oh... Why do you all look so glum?」

Natsuki
「I'm sorry, Misa-san...」
Marika
「We couldn't find the yellowtail wrasse...」
Misa
「Yellowtail wrasse...?」
Marika
「We heard it'd be the star of the show if we had one, so we were looking for it...」

Misa
「I see, so that's why. But there's nothing we can do about it. A yellowtail wrasse is a very rare fish to see at all.」


She smiles a little sadly.
She must already know.
That yesterday really was a once-in-a-lifetime chance.
That might be why she didn't even mention it today.
But...
％Ｂ
「Please wait just one moment!」
I say it as if to try to prove her wrong.
％Ｂ
「It's still too early to give up on the yellowtail wrasse.」
Marika
「What do you mean?」
％Ｂ
「Hmph... I thought this might happen, so I've already taken some measures. To catch a yellowtail wrasse!」


Marika
「What? ...Really?」
％Ｂ
「I set up a trap as soon as we got here, making sure no one would notice!」

Misa
「Why did you need to make sure no one would notice?」
％Ｂ
「Uh... Oh, well... That's because...」
Natsuki
「Misa-san... You have to be understanding... He wanted to be like, "Check it out, ain't I the best?" afterward.」


Marika
「Oh～ ...I think boys can be like that～」
％Ｂ
「No, uh... It's crazy embarrassing now that you've said something like that...」

all
I drag the other three toward the trap that I set up.
％Ｂ
「This is a kinda trap I made back when I was a kid to catch fish in rivers. You cut a plastic bottle about a third of the way down from the top, reverse it, and attach it to the rest of the bottle that way.」


Natsuki
「Oh, I've seen that on TV. It makes it so a fish that goes in can't get out, right?」

Marika
「So that's why you said you wanted plastic bottles yesterday～」
Misa
「I see, a handmade bottle cell.」
％Ｂ
「B-Bottle cell?」
Misa
「Yes, a bottle cell. Also known as bottle traps. They have been used since a long time ago, originally as baskets woven from bamboo.」

Natsuki
「Huh, I'm impressed you knew about something like that. That's pretty cool.」
％Ｂ
「R-Right... Yeah, guess so.」
...Though I had no idea really.
％Ｂ
「Anyway, I set up five of those. Let's go check on them.」

Misa
「How wonderful!」
Natsuki
「You'll be lauded a hero if this ends with a yellowtail wrasse inside one.」

Marika
「I think you'd be really cool～!」
％Ｂ
「...No pressure, I guess.」
all
I nervously pull up the traps I set up.
Natsuki
「W-Well?」
Marika
「Did you get something?」
％Ｂ
「...No... Nothing.」
Unfortunately, there's nothing inside the first trap.
Natsuki
「What, it's completely empty.」
Marika
「I guess we were asking too much～」
％Ｂ
「Th-This is still just the first one. I still have four more.」
Misa
「Yes. Let's expect good things from the second one!」
all
I pull up the second trap.
Marika
「How about this time?」
Natsuki
「Oh, there's a blue one!」
Marika
「What? Really!?」
％Ｂ
「No, this one's...」
Misa
「A neon damselfish.」
It's as she says. There's one of the neon damselfish inside that we saw a bunch of yesterday.

Marika
「It's a different fish?」
Natsuki
「But this one's pretty too. Let me take a photo.」
Three traps left.
Just one is fine.
Please, be in one of them!
Trap number three―
Natsuki
「Nothing inside.」
all
Trap number four―
Marika
「Oh, there's a small crab inside!」
Misa
「Let's let that go, since it seems like it's still a baby.」
all
％Ｂ
「So now there's only one trap left...」
I figured I'd be able to get it in one if I set up five traps, but I guess it's more difficult than I thought...

％Ｂ
「All right, I'm gonna pull up the last one.」
Though I doubt it's gonna be in this one...
％Ｂ
「...Hm?」
Natsuki
「There's something inside, but it's not blue.」
Marika
「It's red. It's small, and kind of like a clownfish...」
Natsuki
「So no dice then～」
％Ｂ
「No, wait a second...」
all
A small red fish that looks like a clownfish...
...Wait.
I'm pretty sure that's ringing a bell somehow...
Misa
「...A yellowtail wrasse.」
％Ｂ
「Wha...?」
Misa
「It's a yellowtail wrasse!」
Marika
「Huh? But it's not blue at all.」
Misa
「It's a juvenile yellowtail wrasse! They change color completely between when they're juvenile and when they're adults!」

That's right, Okihara-senpai said as much yesterday.
So that means...
％Ｂ
「We di―」
Misa
「We did it!」
％Ｂ
「Gueh!?」
Okihara-senpai suddenly embraces me.
Misa
「We did it! It's a yellowtail wrasse!」
％Ｂ
「Wait...! S-Senpai... Th-That's dangerous!」
I'm doing everything I can to not fall over as she hugs me tight.

Misa
「Ahaha! It's a yellowtail wrasse! A yellowtail wrasse!」
％Ｂ
「Y-Yes, it is... That's great... Haha... Ahaha!」
Okihara-senpai's jumping up and down like a kid.
I'm glad she's happy. Yep.
...Though it's kinda hard to breathe like this.
