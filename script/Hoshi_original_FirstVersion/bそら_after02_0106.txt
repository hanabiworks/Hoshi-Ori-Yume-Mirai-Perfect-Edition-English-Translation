The new year comes, the weekend comes after the first three days, and then comes Monday.
Today's the day construction begins for the Fukuzawa house's remodeling.
％Ｂ
「I'll be counting on all of you! Thank you very much!」
I watch over the start of the construction after greeting the contractors.

Azuma
「Yo.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, Teacher! Happy New Year!」
Azuma
「Yeah, Happy New Year.」
％Ｂ
「You came all the way over here?」
Azuma
「Mm... Well, I figured I might as well show up for the first day of construction, since I introduced Fukuzawa-san to you.」

％Ｂ
「Are you sure you didn't just come because you were worried about me?」

Azuma
「Why do I have to worry about you? You're not that fragile.」
Azuma
「...Anyway, I see you asked Miyamoto-san to do the construction.」
％Ｂ
「Yes. Since I've been acquainted with the Miyamoto Group since back when I worked at your firm.」

Azuma
「Yeah... You'll be fine with Miyamoto-san's group. I think you can let them handle it without any worries. It was a good choice to ask Miyamoto-san for your first job. You know he'll see it through to the end.」


％Ｂ
「Thank you very much.」
Azuma
「But don't let your guard down. You never know what's going to happen on site. I always say it, but―」

％Ｂ
「"You should drop by the site often," right? I'm planning on coming here at least once a day to see how things are progressing.」

Azuma
「...It's good that you understand.」
all
This is my first job as an independent architect.
There's no downside to being careful.
I need to do my best to see this remodeling to completion, and satisfy Fukuzawa-san!

I'm tying up some loose ends for the day back at the office.
Sora
「...Hmh...」
Sora came too after finishing her work at the science museum. 
She's sitting at the table, thinking about what to do for the new planetarium show.
％Ｂ
「Phew... Want some coffee?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
Sora
「...Lots of sugar and milk.」
％Ｂ
「Don't blame me if you get fat.」
Sora
「...No issues. I'm using my head lots right now.」
all
I pour Sora's coffee and place it down on the table.
Sora
「...Thanks.」
％Ｂ
「So did you end up going with the moon theme after all?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
Sora
「...I'm thinking about the structure right now. About how to weave together folklore and legends about the moon with the moon landing.」

％Ｂ
「Hm... Yeah, those are kinda total opposites.」
Sora
「...I think the order is important. This is the current structure: start with the origin of the moon, and then introduce religious beliefs, legends, and folklore related to the moon.」


Sora
「And then move to modern day and connect it to the human footprint through the moon landing... What do you think?」

％Ｂ
「I think that sounds pretty good. All that's left is to write the script along those lines, right?」
Sora
「...I have lots of documents to make, so it's a lot of work. I'm worried about whether I'll make it for the deadline.」

％Ｂ
「You'll be fine.」
Sora
「...It's strange, but you saying that makes me think it'll be okay.」
Sora
「...It's strange, but you saying that makes me think it'll be okay.」
％Ｂ
「But I think you should have maybe one more unique touch.」
Sora
「Unique touch?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. I feel like every planetarium's probably got something similar going on at some point about the moon since it's so close.」

Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「So if you're gonna talk about the moon, then you should put your own special spin on it...」

％Ｂ
「Like for example, what if someone came down from the moon, and they were talking about their homeland?」

Sora
「...That sounds really interesting!」
％Ｂ
「And as for who comes down... Let's see... What about bunnies or something?」
Sora
「...Princess Kaguya. I'll do the narration wearing a twelve-layer kimono.」
％Ｂ
「Come on, it's gotta be bunnies. It's gotta be understandable for the kids.」

％Ｂ
「I bet the kids would love it if you put bunny ears on when you did the narration.」

Sora
「...That's just something you want to see, Ryou.」
Sora
「...That's just something you want to see.」
％Ｂ
「Hmh... Fair enough.」
Though I'm more interested in a bunny suit with bunny ears and fishnet.

Sora
「...I can't think of it being anything else.」
％Ｂ
「But I still think the kids would like it.」
Sora
「...Maybe I'll just get a bunny character costume...」
％Ｂ
「Shio-wan and Shio-nyah get a third friend, Shio-pyon!」
Sora
「...It might work.」
Something about that must've tugged on Sora's heartstrings. She gives me a thumbs-up with gusto, her eyes sparkling.
