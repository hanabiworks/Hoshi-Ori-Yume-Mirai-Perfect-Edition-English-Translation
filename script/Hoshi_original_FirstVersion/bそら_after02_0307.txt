Shuuichi and his fiancée Kaori-san have come to the firm to meet about the new house.

Kaori
「Wooow～ Ryousuke-kun, it's been forever～」
Ry-Ryousuke-kun...?
Kaori
「Wooow～ It's been forever～」
％Ｂ
「It-It really has... Kaori-san... Um, you remember me?」

Kaori
「Of course I do～ We met back when Shuuichi was in high school, right～」

Huh, I didn't expect her to remember me, since we only spoke for a few minutes to exchange greetings.

...Though I don't remember her ever calling me Ryousuke-kun.
Kaori
「Shuuichi's always talked about you so much～」
％Ｂ
「Has he really? How so?」
Kaori
「He said you were always following him around in grade school, and you couldn't do anything when he wasn't around.」

％Ｂ
「...I see.」
Shuuichi
「K-Kaori... Let's talk about that some other...」
Kaori
「And you always failed at everything you did in high school, and Shuuichi always had to clean up after you. He said there was once a time you started crying when you were thanking him too～」


％Ｂ
「...I see, I see...」
Shuuichi
「Well, uh... You know how guys are, right? We exaggerate our stories a little because we want to show off to our girlfriends and stuff.」


％Ｂ
「A little, huh...」
I can't say I recall ever following Shuuichi around everywhere and crying while thanking him...

Kaori
「Aaand～ He said you were his most trusted friend, and that getting to know you is his number two treasure in life～」

Shuuichi
「Wait, wait! You don't have to say that!」
Oh, this is the most flustered he's gotten yet...
Kaori
「And he was like, "And you're number one, Kaori～," and then he gave me a biiig kiss～」
％Ｂ
「...」
Pisses me off just a little.
all
Kaori
「But this is amazing～ I heard you're an independent architect～? You're so impressive now～ I'm very proud, as a fellow Shionagi First Academy alum～」


％Ｂ
「Uh... Thank you very much. And you're just as young-looking and pretty as ever yourself, Kaori-san.」

She looks exactly like she did the first time I met her, sheer miniskirt and all.

Kaori
「Aww～ I got a compliment～ What do I do～ Shuuichi～♪」

Shuuichi
「What the hell are you hitting on my fiancée for!?」
％Ｂ
「No, that wasn't what I meant by...」
This is kind of starting to become a pain, so let's hurry and start talking about the matter at hand.

all
％Ｂ
「Um... You two are both well aware of why I had you come here today. I'd like to discuss the matter of the new house that you have commissioned me for.」


Kaori
「Okaaay～ What should we talk about?」
％Ｂ
「Whether you plan on having a child right after getting married, for example. If that is the case, how many. Things like―」

Kaori
「Awww～ A baby～ Kaori's so embarrassed～♪」
Shuuichi
「I bet our baby would be adorable!」
Kaori
「Do you want a boy or a girl, Shuuichi～?」
Shuuichi
「I want the first to be a girl, and the second to be a boy. It's the classic.」
Kaori
「If that's what you want, then I'll do my best～ I want the four of us to be happy together～♪」

Shuuichi
「Kaori...」
Kaori
「Shuuichi...♪」
all
％Ｂ
「...So two children, then.」
I guess I'll just have to make the decisions myself at this point.
％Ｂ
「If that's the case, then we should probably build rooms for the children in advance... Also, is there a possibility of either of your parents coming to live with you?」

Kaori
「That reminds me, do you know what Shuuichi said to propose to me?」
％Ｂ
「What? Uh... No, I don't...」
Kaori
「"I'll take care of you and your family, everything! So believe in me and follow me～!" Can you believe it～♪ Kaori fell in love all over again～♪」


％Ｂ
「...So your wife's parents may possibly come to live with you. Which means we'll probably need to account for an eventual barrier-free design...」

Shuuichi
「Oh, right. Can we make a basement too?」
％Ｂ
「It's definitely not out of the question... What for?」
Shuuichi
「You know how I play guitar, right? I thought it'd be cool if I could play as loud as I wanted in a soundproofed basement.」

％Ｂ
「Uh... No, I don't know that you play guitar. I've never seen that.」

Shuuichi
「Huh? Did I really never show you? Well, whatever. If you're getting a house built, then you'd want a room where you can just immerse yourself in your hobbies, right? It's a man's dream, you know?」


％Ｂ
「Well, uh... Dreams are great and all, but it costs a lot of money to make a basement, just so you know. It'd be cheaper to add an entire third floor to the house than make a small basement.」


Shuuichi
「Really... So that's why it's mostly rich people who have secret basements...」
％Ｂ
「Oh, right, do you have a theme or anything for the house?」
Shuuichi
「Capital-L Love Nest, please!」
％Ｂ
「...I told you, I don't want something that general. I wanna know if you have something more specific that you want...」

all
Kaori
「I want a big house～ One that's wide open, with lots of warm sunlight, with a comfy breeze blowing through it. Something like that.」


％Ｂ
「...So something with a very spacious feel to it?」
Kaori
「Yeah, that～」
Shuuichi
「I want rooms like this office. I don't mean cozy, but more like smart and clean in design. How do I say it... Like...」


％Ｂ
「Stylish?」
Shuuichi
「Yeah, that! Stylish, and a capital-L Love Nest! That's the theme!」

Kaori
「Oh... I think I might want a bookshelf～ A bookshelf that takes up a whole wall that I can put lots of books in～!」

Shuuichi
「She's got this ridiculous number of books.」
％Ｂ
「I heard from Shuuichi that you used to be in the literature club.」
all
Kaori
「I know some people might say I should just leave them at my parents' house, but each and every one of them is filled with memories, so I want them all close by.」


％Ｂ
「Yes, I understand.」
So I guess she's still a literature club member at heart.
Though she definitely doesn't look the part.
％Ｂ
「Let's incorporate a bookshelf, then. One that can fill an entire wall with books, like at a library.」

Kaori
「I love that idea～♪ It really was the right call to go with him～ Shuuichi♪」

Shuuichi
「We're expecting great things!」
％Ｂ
「Yeah... I'll do my best to meet those expectations as much as possible.」
all
I check my blog after Shuuichi and Kaori-san go home.
％Ｂ
「Oh...」
There are a few comments on the post about the Fukuzawa house's remodeling.

"What a wonderful remodeling. I think we might do one soon too～"
"I want to do something like this too... How much would something like this cost?"

"I didn't know you could change this much with a remodeling! Wow!"\n \n\r
"Just from my perspective, but the designer has an incredible sense of aesthetics. Most remodelings only make things look newer."

"Could you do just one room? I can't afford an entire home, but I'd like to try changing the feel of a room..."

"This is great work!"
％Ｂ
「...This is more than I expected.」
And it's all really high praise on top of that.
I'm genuinely happy.
％Ｂ
「...I've got mail too.」
It's mail from people seriously considering remodeling their homes.

A few of them say they want to come by the firm in person to have a more concrete discussion...

％Ｂ
「Oh... This is great.」
I carefully write out polite replies to them to begin the process of settling on a date and time for each discussion.

％Ｂ
「I hope things'll start to get busy now...」
