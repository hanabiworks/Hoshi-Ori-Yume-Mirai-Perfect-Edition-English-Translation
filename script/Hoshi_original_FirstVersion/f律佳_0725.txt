「It's gotten pretty late, so maybe we should wrap things up here for today.」
Marika
「We're getting pretty close to finishing, aren't we?」

Sora
「...*nod* Lots of stars.」
Natsuki
「Looks like we'll be able to make it in time.」
all
The floor's covered in wires and scraps of paper.
It's the remnants from us cutting the stars out of them.
We tried placing light bulbs inside the paper stars and turned them on today. They lit up properly on the outside.

The paper didn't get hot or anything when we left them on for a while, so there shouldn't be any chance of it being a fire hazard.

All that's left to do is to just keep doing more of what we've already been doing.
％Ｂ
「We can't breathe easy just yet, though. We'll still have to do some final fine-tuning, and there's a chance we've missed something so far.」

％Ｂ
「But that's no reason for us to risk making mistakes by rushing things. Let's keep moving at a good, steady pace.」

Marika
「You're right. We'll definitely be able to make this succeed if we all work together.」
all
Touko
「But Piano-chan didn't come again today, did she?」

Misa
「Is she busy, perhaps?」
％Ｂ
「Yes, it seems like everyone in the concert team also has their hands full.」
all
I walked to school with Rikka today too, and we're keeping in touch via our phones.

She's the same as usual when she's talking with me, but she occasionally just stares off into the distance, lost in thought.

But she still hasn't said anything to me.
I've tried asking Ishizuka-san about things, but it doesn't seem like she's come to any kind of decision about playing together with Meguru-chan.

I'm getting worried. It's been a while now.
I want to wait until Rikka decides to talk to me about it, if possible.
But there's a limit to how long I can hold off my worry.

Maybe I should ask her about it indirectly sometime soon, when the opportunity arises.

％Ｂ
「Thanks. Later.」
Shuuichi
「Yeah. Good work today.」
I say my goodbyes to Shuuichi in the committee room and leave.
The concert team apparently finished its work a little earlier, and I was told that Rikka had already left.

％Ｂ
「...Wonder if we just missed each other or something.」
She isn't answering my messages, and she won't pick up when I call her.
％Ｂ
「I can't really imagine she'd just go home without telling me...」
It's become a habit for us to go home together, and we always let each other know if we can't for some reason.

％Ｂ
「Guess I'll look around school.」
Plink... Plunk... Plink...
I see her jet-black hair in a room dyed with orange.
Her fingers occasionally press onto the keys.
...I figured she'd be here.
Once I decided to look for her, I just walked directly to this room.
I was sure that if I didn't find her here, then I'd have a hell of a time finding her elsewhere.

Plink... Plink...
She's like a child, meaninglessly pressing down on the keys of a toy piano.
There's no emotion in the notes. All she's doing is producing sound.

Rikka
「...」
She eventually places both hands in her lap and stops playing altogether.
％Ｂ
「That last one was a La. Did I get it right?」
Rikka
「Ryousuke...」
Rikka
「...」
％Ｂ
「Been looking for you. You haven't been answering your phone.」
Rikka
「Oh... I'm sorry. I didn't notice.」
％Ｂ
「It's fine. Thinking about something?」
Rikka
「...This is the same piano...」
％Ｂ
「?」
Rikka
「It was like Lorelei's singing. And I was a ship, sailing along the Rhine River... Were there any ships that didn't sink after being lured by Lorelei?」
That's when I finally understand what she's talking about.
...And what's lurking inside Rikka.
It's envy toward Meguru-chan.
It's a feeling of inferiority compared to Meguru-chan.
％Ｂ
「So you heard Meguru-chan's playing the day before yesterday?」
Rikka
「...Mhm. I could hear it throughout the school building. Others were stopping to listen too.」

Rikka
「Meguru's performances are incredible, aren't they? You don't have to know who it is that's playing. Just the sound is enough to move people. That must be what real piano playing is like.」
Rikka
「It makes no distinction between gender, age, race, or even language... It's true music. Piano playing that appeals to a listener's heart and comforts them... Didn't you think so too?」


I hesitate. Is it okay for me to say what I'm about to say to her, the way she is now?
But I'd never lie to her about something like this.
％Ｂ
「It was good. Really good.」
Rikka
「Yes. I felt the same way.」
She says it numbly, but then smiles.
Rikka
「Let's go home.」
Rikka and I are walking home.
We've come up to her apartment complex.
Rikka
「Oh. There's apparently supposed to be a hurricane tomorrow. You should take anything that's outside and bring it in. Would you like me to help?」
％Ｂ
「No, it's fine. There's not that much to bring in anyway.」
Her smile's the same as always.
It's the same as always... which is exactly why it seems forced to me.

I don't know what happened between Rikka and Meguru-chan in the past.
But I can tell it has to do with the piano.
I'm not good at music. In fact, I'm terrible at it.
I have absolutely zero knowledge regarding the piano. I couldn't possibly play it.
Could someone like me do anything to help, even if she did tell me what's on her mind?

But there's no way I could just leave Rikka like this.

If I can't do anything now, then I want to become able to do something.

And to do that, first I need to...
％Ｂ
「Hey, Rikka―」
all
She places her key into the slot in the intercom.
The auto-lock releases, and the door opens.
...
The hairs on my neck suddenly stand on end.
A vision hangs before me... of Rikka being sucked into the darkness beyond that doorway. Disappearing.

Rikka
「Thank you for walking―」
％Ｂ
「Wait!」
I grab her hand to stop her.
Rikka
「What's wrong?」
％Ｂ
「Am I not dependable? Do you think I won't be able to do anything?」
％Ｂ
「I want you to tell me what's been on your mind.」
Rikka
「Oh...!」
％Ｂ
「I want to help you... Even if I can't do anything for you, if talking about it could make things even the slightest bit easier for you... then I wanna hear it.」

％Ｂ
「...I'm sorry. I know you said you wanted to think about it on your own, but I just can't sit back and watch.」

Rikka
「...Thank you for worrying about me. I made you feel that way because of how I was acting, didn't I...?」

Rikka
「...I think this is something that other people would find completely pointless. It's so pointless that you'd wonder why I'm even thinking about something like this as hard as I am. I know that, but...」

％Ｂ
「I wanna know everything about you, Rikka. Even the pointless, boring stuff.」
％Ｂ
「But... I wouldn't ever think of that as pointless or boring.」
Rikka
「...」
Squeeze...
％Ｂ
「...Rikka?」
She presses herself against me and wraps her arms around me desperately.
I can feel her softness and smell her sweet, girly scent all over.
Rikka
「You know, I worry sometimes. Maybe you're a marriage swindler.」

％Ｂ
「A marriage swindler...?」
Rikka
「Because you always say such wonderful words exactly when I want to hear them.」
％Ｂ
「I'm not trying to do that.」
Rikka
「It's even worse if this is all on accident... But that's the you I fell in love with.」

％Ｂ
「I wouldn't say stuff like this to anyone other than you.」
Rikka
「So you're my personal swindler. I've been completely duped, haven't I?」
％Ｂ
「Now that's just an awful thing to say...」
Rikka
「Hehe. I'm kidding. But I think it'd be okay to be duped by you. I want you to deceive me all the way down to my heart... and make me yours in every single way.」
％Ｂ
「...」
Rikka
「Um... I... Meguru's... Oh.」
She notices something.
all
I turn around to where she's looking.
Meguru
「Oh...」
％Ｂ
「Oh...」
Meguru
「I-I'm sorry! I didn't think you two would be holding each other in front of the building! I should really learn to read the mood, right!? I'm so, so sorry!」
I'm surprised too, but Meguru-chan's genuinely frantic.
Meguru
「Um. I'll go relax for about two or three hours at a café!」
％Ｂ
「You don't have to do that!」
Why is she being so specific about her relaxation time!?
Meguru
「I'll make sure to let you know via mail before coming back too!」
％Ｂ
「You don't need to do that either, okay!?」

The two of us both feel awkward about what's happened, but Rikka's calm and composed.

She slowly pulls away from me as if it were only natural.
Rikka
「Welcome back. Are you done with work?」
Meguru
「Oh... Mhm. I'll have to get on a flight tonight because I have work in Tokyo, but I came back because I had a little time before then.」
Rikka
「I see. I'll make you something to eat right away, then. You're hungry, aren't you?」

Meguru
「Mhm, starving. But... um... Is it okay?」
She looks at me hesitantly.
％Ｂ
「I don't mind. I was thinking of going home anyway, since there's apparently a hurricane coming.」

Rikka
「So he says. There's no issue. See you, Ryousuke.」
Rikka
「So he says. There's no issue. See you.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. Later.」
Rikka
「Let's go, Meguru.」
Meguru
「Please excuse me, Senpai.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. See you again, Meguru-chan.」
all
I watch Rikka as she walks into the apartment complex with Meguru-chan.
The elevator doors open, and Meguru-chan waves at me after getting in. I wave back.

The two of them disappear, and I sigh.
％Ｂ
「It sounded like she was about to tell me, too...」
％Ｂ
「Nnnhh～～～ ...Hahh... Guess I'll go to sleep.」
I close the book I was reading and stretch out in my office chair.

The book's something like a textbook that anyone who wants to be an architect―especially one in the modern day―has read.
It's been half a century since the first printing, but it's still incredibly popular reading.
The price tag's well over 10,000 yen, but it's worth even more than that to me.

％Ｂ
「I remember I bought this with my first paycheck...」
I guess this book holds some good memories for me.
I've read through it over and over, enough to wear it out.
I find something new every time, and it always fills me with happiness.
...But not today.
％Ｂ
「It's not like it's something to talk about over the phone...」
It's important, so we should talk about it directly.
But when's that gonna be?
...Tomorrow?
...The day after tomorrow, with the hurricane coming?
Time's just slipping through my fingers.
％Ｂ
「...!」
I fling myself at my phone.
I thought it might be Rikka, but the display doesn't show me a name.

It's from an unregistered number.
Wonder who it is...

％Ｂ
「Hello?」
Meguru
『Good evening, Senpai. I apologize for calling so late at night. This is Meguru.』
％Ｂ
「What? Meguru-chan?」
Meguru
『Yes. I told Onee-chan I wanted to thank you for giving me a tour of the school the other day, and had her tell me your phone number.』
Meguru
『May I take up some of your time?』
％Ｂ
「Sure, that's fine.」
Meguru
『Thank you very much. Um... I apologize for earlier today. My timing was just terrible... You were talking about something important with Onee-chan, weren't you?』

％Ｂ
「It wasn't on purpose, right? I can't get angry with you about that. And wait, you knew?」

I figured she had misunderstood something from the way she had been weirdly specific about her relaxation time.

Meguru
『The mood seemed that way. I thought Onee-chan must have been about to tell you about it.』

Meguru
『So... I'm just so sorry for getting in the way, after I asked you to help her...』

％Ｂ
「I'm pretty sure I would've done the same thing regardless of whether you asked me to or not.」

％Ｂ
「I want to help her too. You don't need to feel guilty about anything.」

Meguru
『Senpai... Thank you very much. Please take care of Onee-chan.』

％Ｂ
「Yeah. I'll handle it.」
Meguru
『Anyway, I have work from now, so...』
％Ｂ
「Now? That's pretty rough.」
Meguru
『I just arrived in Tokyo, and I'm on the way to the studio. I've been given the opportunity to make an appearance on a music program on a leading broadcasting station. There's also a talk show segment, so I'm a bit nervous.』

Meguru
『It's apparently to be broadcast over there starting next month. It would make me happy if you would watch it.』

％Ｂ
「I definitely will! You do your best with work, Meguru-chan.」
Meguru
『Thank you very much. Good night, Senpai.』
_smh_st_04
I walk over to the window after ending the phone call.
The sky's a deep navy blue. There isn't even a hint of the hurricane to be found.
I wish on the stars glimmering above for it to change its course.
