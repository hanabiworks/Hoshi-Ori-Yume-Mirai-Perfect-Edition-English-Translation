After that...
Rikka told her parents about how she felt.
That... she wanted to work toward becoming a professional pianist again.
And so her mother Sayaka-san introduced her to an ex-pianist named Aoyagi Akiko so she could start learning piano again.
Aoyagi-sensei is apparently someone Sayaka-san studied under when she went to university for music.

She was living out her retirement in her advanced age, but she accepted Rikka as her student on account of her being Sayaka-san's daughter.

Balancing school and piano lessons sounded like it was tough for her, but Rikka was always smiling.

That's why I was able to smile too, even though it meant we spent less time together.
―June of our third year of high school.
Rikka entered the Shionagi National Music Contest for piano.
It's apparently a famous national contest that's held once every three years.
As someone who was never interested in music as a kid, I had no idea that a contest like that existed in this city, but an even greater surprise still awaited me.


Rikka breezed through the preliminary judgments, auditions, qualifying rounds, semifinals, and amazingly enough, made it all the way to the finals.

％Ｂ
「It's crazy that you got fourth place in a contest like that. That means you're one of the top performers in all of Japan, right?」
Rikka
「I was surprised I was able to perform so easily. It's all thanks to you and the others.」

％Ｂ
「It's all thanks to your own ability. It's something you've always had in you. All we did was cheer you on.」

I know that the world isn't an easy enough place that she could do that well from just a single year of practice.
Rikka's always downplayed her own ability, but it must be thanks to her knowledge and her strong grasp of fundamentals.

％Ｂ
「Besides, it'd be a disservice to the other performers if you say you only won because of your support, right?」

Rikka
「Hehe, that's true. You're right. But it's also true that your support drew out what I had within me. Thank you so much.」


％Ｂ
「Though I'd definitely have made you first place if I were a judge. You would've gotten to play with the orchestra and do a recital and stuff if you'd gotten first place.」

Rikka
「Hehe. You're way too biased toward your girlfriend. I'm completely inadequate. There are still lots and lots of things I need to study.」
Rikka's become a local celebrity recently, with regional television broadcasts and music-related publishing companies coming to interview her.

And they've all been asking her about her plans for the future.
She's deliberately avoided saying anything about her career plans, despite her stating she wants to become a professional pianist.

I think the only ones who know the actual answer are her close friends, me included.
The vice-president of the concert judging committee is actually one Franz Schiele, who had retired as a conductor the previous year.

He's an influential figure in the music world, and also one of Narusawa Sayaka's old teachers.
He became a faculty member at the music department at a local national university in our area, in order to groom the next generation.

He absolutely loved Rikka's performance, and asked her if she wanted to study under him.

Rikka
「It's very much an honor to be asked to study under you, but I find myself awed to imagine doing so.」

Schiele
「Hmmh... You use difficult words, Rikka-san. Do you have someone teaching you right now?」

Rikka
「Yes. But she has told me that if there is something I would like to do, then I am free to do so.」

Schiele
「Do you plan on going to Austria to where Sayaka is, then?」
Rikka
「I still haven't considered...」
Schiele
「Rikka-san. I have fallen in love with your music. It is sensitive, emotional, delicate, in true Japanese fashion, to a degree beyond Sayaka. It is truly wonderful.」

Schiele
「But you are still unpolished. You will be a diamond if polished. I would love to help you grow. May I not be your teacher?」

Rikka
「...」
％Ｂ
「It'd be "selfish," right?」
Rikka
「...What?」
Rikka's probably hesitating because of me.
Before Rikka placed in that contest, we were talking about stuff like how it'd be great if we could go to the same university.

About how it'd be great to live together if we ended up going to the same university. We just talked about vague dreams like that.

That must be what's on her mind.
％Ｂ
「It's good to think about others, but you should prioritize what you want to do now.」
Rikka
「...Mhm. Thank you. Schiele-sensei. I look forward to studying under you.」
Schiele
「It would be my honor! ...By the way, who is this?」
Rikka
「Oh, this is my boyfriend.」
％Ｂ
「Pleased to meet you. I'm ％Ａ ％Ｂ.」
Schiele
「Boyfriend... Ohh, mein freund. So you are like this with Rikka-san.」
He wraps his arms around himself, puckers his lips, and makes a loud mmmchuuu～ sound to mimic kissing.\n\r

Quite the passionate performance, too.
Rikka
「Auh...」
％Ｂ
「...」
...This guy's supposed to be a world-famous musical celebrity, right?
Schiele
「Ohh, there is no need to worry. I will not say that love is forbidden. Love is also very necessary for the piano.」


Schiele
「But do not focus so much on sex that you lose sight of the piano, yes? Sex in moderation.」
Rikka
「Ah...uh... Y-Yes...」
...He seems to be a friendly, good-natured teacher, like Rikka said... Too good-natured, if anything.
And so Rikka decided to aim for a national university, while also taking lessons from Schiele-sensei before entering.

All that's left is my own career path.
Becoming an architect's just one stop on the way to my goal. I want to be an architect like Mr. Azuma.
And to do that, I just have to study under Mr. Azuma's guidance. I'll have to go to a local university.

...
...Well, I'll just cut straight to the chase.
I applied for the architecture department at the same university as Rikka, and passed.

I kept it a secret for as long as possible because I wanted to see her reaction, and...

Rikka
「I hate you, Ryousuke.」
Rikka
「I hate you.」
％Ｂ
「Sorry. I was keeping it a secret 'cause I thought it'd make you happy.」

Rikka
「I was the only one who didn't know, wasn't I? Natsuki and the others all knew, and I was the only one left out...」

Rikka calls Segawa "Natsuki" now.
I think it started around last spring.
I dunno how it really happened, but I know it's a good thing, so I haven't really bothered asking her why.

％Ｂ
「I asked them all not to tell 'cause I wanted to surprise you. I'm really sorry. Please forgive me!」

I clap my hands together and bow my head.
Rikka
「...Do you want me to forgive you?」
％Ｂ
「I do!」
Rikka
「...Then kiss me... Mmh.」
She closes her eyes and tilts her chin upward a little.
It's what she does whenever she wants a kiss.
％Ｂ
「Sure.」
This doesn't really have anything to do with having her forgive me. I always want to kiss her.

I place my hands lightly against the small of her back, wrapping myself around her.
I place a kiss onto her soft lips as I feel her tiny breaths.

Rikka
「Mm... chu. Hehe... Congratulations on being accepted, Ryousuke.」
Rikka
「Mm... chu. Hehe... Congratulations on being accepted.」
％Ｂ
「Congratulations to you for being accepted too, Rikka.」
Rikka
「...Hgh, geez, you're so stupid...! ...Thank you.」
She shoves herself against my chest.
She's sniffling with her face pressed into me.
％Ｂ
「What? Did I make you cry?」
Rikka
「That's right... You made me cry. U-Uuuhh... fhh... Stupid, stupid...!」
Rikka
「I can't believe I get to go to the same school as you again... I couldn't even imagine... a happier surprise...!」
％Ｂ
「Haha, I'm glad. Looks like my plan was a success.」
Rikka
「Uuuuh... Geez, you're soooo stupid!」
I pet her head to calm her down as she drips her tears onto my clothes.

I didn't expect this... My plan worked a little too well.
I should really say this after she's done crying...
But I need a nice mood and some world-class courage to do this. I'll have to say it now.
％Ｂ
「Rikka, I wanna talk about something. So please listen.」
Rikka
「...Uuh, sniff... What is it?」
％Ｂ
「I think we've talked about this before already... but now that we're gonna be going to the same school―」

％Ｂ
「How about we rent an apartment and try living together?」
Rikka
「...」
％Ｂ
「You're aiming to become a pianist, and I'm aiming to be an architect... I dunno exactly how our future's gonna turn out from now on...」

％Ｂ
「But uh... we could start by living together, or, uh... I don't wanna do something halfway serious like just continuing to date from now on.」


％Ｂ
「Rikka... I know I'm not much yet... but could I ask you to seriously consider a future together with me?」

Rikka
「...」
％Ｂ
「Uh... Maybe you don't remember how we were talking about how we wanted to live together before?」
It was just us talking about dream lifestyles. It'd have been weird to take it seriously at this point.

It's totally possible she doesn't remember.
Rikka
「...I remember.」
％Ｂ
「Huh!?」
Rikka
「It's something I talked about with you. Of course I remember everything.」

％Ｂ
「So what do you think? I know it's important, so you don't have to give me an answer right away.」

Rikka
「Can I consider that... a proposal... just now?」
％Ｂ
「Wha? A pro... oh... Yeah! You can.」
I was about that serious about it.
Rikka
「Then... No.」
％Ｂ
「Wha... Oh, really...」
Rikka
「...When you propose to me... I want you to tell me properly that you want to marry me.」

％Ｂ
「...Huh? Uh... Wait, so that means...」
Rikka
「...Mhm.」
She gives a small, but clear nod.
Rikka
「Uuuhh... Sniff, geez... You're so unfair today, Ryousuke...」
Rikka
「Uuuhh... Sniff, geez... You're so unfair today...」
Rikka
「How much do you have to make me cry until you're satisfied... Hgh, waaaahh, waaaaaaaahh...!」
Rikka's just as much a crybaby as ever...
And so I managed to get her to say okay.
We talked about how we should become independent in whatever ways we could with our future in mind, and strengthened our resolve.


But that wasn't the end. We still need to do what needs doing.
We need to tell our parents.
We're planning on earning the money for our lifestyle ourselves, but we still need to let each other's parents know.

Rikka's parents are supposed to come back to Japan briefly to handle things for Rikka entering university.

But that's still in the near future, so we're starting with my parents.
I've already introduced Rikka to them, and she's come over several times, but this is pretty different. I'm a little nervous.
Mother
「That's okay. Right, dear?」
Father
「Yeah. You can do whatever you want.」
I brought it up abruptly at dinner, and they immediately accepted it.
Rikka's eyes are wide too.
all
％Ｂ
「Uh... I'm happy, of course. But that was kinda anticlimactic...」

Mother
「We already know Rikka-chan well. There's no reason for us to say no.」
Father
「You're not a kid anymore. You're old enough to be deciding things for yourself.」

Father
「But decisions always come hand in hand with responsibility. This isn't about just you. It's about Rikka-san too. You just make sure you keep that in mind.」


％Ｂ
「I know.」
Mother
「But it's a shame... You could go to university from home, couldn't you? It'd be a waste of money to rent somewhere. Why don't you just have Rikka-chan live here too?」

Mother
「We still have rooms left over, you know... Or you could just use Ryousuke's room. What do you think?」

Mother
「We still have rooms left over, you know... What do you think?」
Father
「Hahaha. They'd never be able to relax that way. There'll be times when they want time to themselves.」

Mother
「That's true. I remember back when your father and I were like that. Rikka-chan, take care of Ryousuke, okay?」

Mother
「That's true. I remember back when your father and I were like that. Rikka-chan, take care of him, okay?」

Father
「It puts me at ease to know that a woman like you will be by my son's side, Rikka-san. Please take good care of him.」

Rikka
「Oh... Yes. Thank you very much. As inadequate as I may be, I hope I can meet your expectations.」
And so, my family was easy enough.
And finally, it's time for Rikka's parents.
To be honest, I've only met them once before.
The orchestra that Rikka's dad is the director of had a performance in Japan last year, and they invited me to dinner with them then.

Which means that they should at least be aware of me as her boyfriend.
...Though I doubt they're expecting me to ask them to let me live together with their daughter on the second meeting.

They both seemed like calm, refined people, so I'm sure they'll at least listen to everything I have to say.

The only thing is whether or not I'll be able to communicate my passion and sincerity.
...I don't think I've ever been this nervous before. It feels like my arms and legs are numb.

％Ｂ
「Please allow me to have your daughter!!」
Rikka
「Wha...!?」
Sayaka
「...What?」
Rikka's Father
「Ohh...」
all
％Ｂ
「Agh, I-I meant! That's not what I meant to say! Please let me try again!」

I take deep breaths, but I can't calm down at all.
But I can't just make them wait.
I swallow to wet my dry throat.
％Ｂ
「I'm currently still dating Rikka-san. I'm very serious about our relationship, and I don't want this to end at all... I would like to stay with her.」


％Ｂ
「We will be graduating high school this spring, and we will be going to the same university. I thought this could be a good opportunity for us to consider our future together, and I have asked Rikka-san to live together with me.」

％Ｂ
「Rikka-san has said yes, and my parents have both also accepted the arrangement.」

％Ｂ
「Please. Would it be okay if Rikka-san and I lived together?」
I straighten out my back and lower my head.
Sayaka
「...」
Rikka's Father
「...」
Both of them are silent, apparently thinking.
It's a bit stifling.
But I've already said what I wanted to say. All I can do is wait.
Eventually, Rikka's dad speaks.
Rikka's Father
「To be honest, I don't know much about you.」
％Ｂ
「Yes...」
Rikka
「Wait, Dad. Ryousuke is...」
Rikka
「Wait, Dad. He's...!」
Rikka's Father
「Now wait a minute, Rikka. I'm still talking. This isn't something the two of you decided on the spur of the moment, is it?」

％Ｂ
「No. We took our time and decided on it together.」
Rikka
「Mhm. I talked with him about it multiple times.」
Rikka's Father
「Then feel free to try doing as you'd like. Sayaka, do you have any objections?」

Sayaka
「No. Rikka, try your best together.」
Rikka
「Mom, Dad... Thank you.」
all
％Ｂ
「Thank you very much!」
The two of us both bow our heads low at the same time.
Rikka's Father
「To tell the truth, we had absolutely no idea what to do when Rikka told us she would be staying behind on her own.」

Rikka's Father
「We knew Rikka was suffering. But we couldn't tell her that it was okay for her to stop playing the piano...」

Rikka's Father
「It would have meant taking the piano away from her after all of her efforts. And most importantly, it would also have meant that we as parents would be limiting our daughter's options for the future.」
Rikka's Father
「...It was all the more difficult for us exactly because we knew just how much work Rikka had put in. All we could do was to take our distance for a while and entrust the matter to Rikka's own discretion...」
Rikka's Father
「...But that's just an excuse from parents who were too occupied with their work to find time for their own daughter. We're failures as parents.」
Rikka's Father
「Rikka. Please forgive us.」
Sayaka
「I'm sorry.」
Rikka
「It's okay...」
She shakes her head a little.
Rikka
「I'm the one who worried by myself and kept it all bottled up inside without trying to talk to anyone else about it. I'm sorry.」

all
Rikka's Father
「But I think good things came of all this too. Because you met Ryousuke-kun that way, and decided on your own path yourself. That's only taking the end results into account, of course.」

Rikka's Father
「But I think good things came of all this too. Because you met him that way, and decided on your own path yourself. That's only taking the end results into account, of course.」

Rikka's dad exhales.
Rikka's Father
「Haha. You really surprised me when you asked to have our daughter.」
％Ｂ
「I-I'm very sorry!」
Sayaka
「Oh, but isn't that just a matter of time?」
Rikka's Father
「Oh, stop it. I don't want to feel that old yet.」
Sayaka
「I think it's fine to feel a little older, if it's for the sake of my daughter's happiness. And Meguru's so focused on the piano, I don't see any sign of anything like that on her end.」

Rikka's Father
「Can't she just have the piano as her lover? That would make me happier.」
Sayaka
「Please no, I don't want to see my grandchildren come from a piano.」
We all laugh.
The mood's clearly softened.
Maybe they could tell how tense we are, and they're trying to get us to relax.

Sayaka
「Ryousuke-san, I may have only met you once before this, but I trust you.」

Sayaka
「You know, I may have only met you once before this, but I trust you.」

Sayaka
「I've heard lots about you from Meguru about how her sister has a wonderful boyfriend. I've never heard her compliment someone uninvolved with music that much.」
Seems like Meguru-chan helped me out behind closed doors.

I'll have to thank her at some point later.
Sayaka
「And most importantly, you're the person Rikka's chosen to be her boyfriend. She's all prickly and cold, isn't she?」

Rikka
「Mom!?」
％Ｂ
「Just occasionally. But I'd like to think I understand her. I find everything about her cute, that included.」
Rikka
「Aah, uuuh... You didn't have to say that in front of my parents...」
all
Rikka's Father
「I'm glad you two seem to get along so well. Please take good care of Rikka, Ryousuke-kun.」

Rikka's Father
「I'm glad you two seem to get along so well. Please take good care of Rikka.」

Sayaka
「Please do.」
％Ｂ
「I will.」
Sayaka
「But Rikka. Have you decided what kind of pianist you want to become?」
Rikka
「I...」
Sayaka
「There may be shortcuts to becoming a pianist, but there's no path that's just called being a pianist. You should think things over carefully, together with Ryousuke-kun.」
Sayaka
「There may be shortcuts to becoming a pianist, but there's no path that's just called being a pianist. You two should think things over carefully, together.」
After we managed to get permission from Rikka's parents―
Azuma
「I appreciate you coming back to reapply after I already failed you once.」
％Ｂ
「I just have to work under your tutelage! Please!」

I bow my head low to Mr. Azuma from the other side of the interview table.

Azuma
「So you got accepted into that university. It's pretty high level, with a good assortment of instructors.」

Azuma
「And the work you've brought is orders of magnitudes better than that first time you came running in here.」
Azuma
「I'd like to think I know the kind of person you are as well. I know you're hardworking.」

％Ｂ
「Then...!」
He puts a hand to his chin and grins.
Azuma
「No, not yet. There's one thing I want to ask. You barely came at all for about a half year after I rejected you. What were you doing during that time?」


％Ｂ
「I joined a committee and worked hard to make our school's Tanabata Festival a success.」
Azuma
「Is that all?」
％Ｂ
「...I also got a girlfriend.」
I wonder if he's going to think I was just goofing off.
But I don't want to lie to the man I respect.
Azuma
「Pfff, hahahahahahah! I see, a girlfriend! You got a girlfriend!」

Azuma
「I like it! That's just great! I'm glad you seem to have enjoyed your time in high school.」

％Ｂ
「Wha...?」
Azuma
「It's beyond easy to learn how to do work if you're employed here. Having a wide, varied foundation of experience is what's important for your growth after that point.」

Azuma
「Especially for a firm like ours. A lot of the time, your ability to get work's gonna be decided by a single point of inspiration.」

Azuma
「What I'm saying is you've gone and created a foundation for yourself that's yours and yours alone. All right, I'll take you in.」

％Ｂ
「Oh... Thank you very much!!」
all
I bow my head again.
Firm Staff A
「That was a bit mean to do. You were already saying you'd hire him if he applied again after becoming a university student.」


％Ｂ
「Wha!?」
Azuma
「Shut up... Anyway, come after school starting tomorrow. I'll pay you, but don't expect much. Think of the beginning as just learning.」
％Ｂ
「Yes!」
Azuma
「And, let's see... Bring your girlfriend sometime. I wanna see what kinda girl you got for yourself.」
％Ｂ
「She's crazy pretty, and cute, and has a great personality.」
Azuma
「Hoh, well look at you, raising the bar. I'm a harsh judge, you know.」
％Ｂ
「She's the best girlfriend ever. I'll guarantee it.」
And when I did actually introduce Rikka to Azuma-san for the first time, he voiced his approval.

By the time the chill of winter subsided and spring breathed throughout the city...
Rikka had gotten hired for a part-time job at a music café...
And we had begun preparing seriously to live together.
And so...
It's almost time for us to graduate high school.
