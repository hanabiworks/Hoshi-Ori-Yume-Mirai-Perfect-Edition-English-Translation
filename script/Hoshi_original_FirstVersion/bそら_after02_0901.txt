Sora's started to come to my office and spend the day there more and more on her days off.

I'm really grateful to have her, since she does miscellaneous work, answers the phone, and sometimes stays in the office in case someone comes by while I'm out.

Sora's currently working hard on writing the new planetarium show which doubles as her promotion exam.

Sora
「...Something extra.」
Sora suddenly stops tapping away at her computer and speaks.

％Ｂ
「Sorry, what?」
Sora
「...I want something extra. Winter is when we have fewer visitors in general. I need something extra to make visitors want to go out of their way to come to the planetarium when it's cold out.」


％Ｂ
「Hm... I see.」
Sora
「...Currently taking ideas.」
Which must mean she wants my opinion...
％Ｂ
「Hmm... It's shooting stars, so why not try tying it to wishes or something?」

Sora
「...Wishes...」
Sora
「...Gasp!」
％Ｂ
「Hm? Got some sudden inspiration?」
Sora
「We'll have the visitors write down wishes when they enter.」
％Ｂ
「Hm, hm.」
Sora
「And you make them come true.」
Sora
「And you make them come true.」
％Ｂ
「Stop. When did I become museum staff?」
Sora
「...Gasp... You're right...」
I guess Sora's lost on what to do.
％Ｂ
「...Uhh... Then, I know it's not anything unique, but what about souvenirs or something? Give everyone who comes to the planetarium a present.」


Sora
「A souvenir... Something to remember the planetarium by... A star...?」
％Ｂ
「There you go, saying crazy stuff again... I'd go every day if I could get a star there.」

Sora
「...Meteorites are possible.」
％Ｂ
「Oh yeah, that'd be... Wait, how are you gonna get meteorites? Can you just buy them?」

Sora
「...You can.」
％Ｂ
「What kinda prices are we talking here?」
Sora
「...All kinds. Starting at 100 yen at internet auctions, and about 140,000,000 yen for the expensive ones.」


％Ｂ
「One hundred for... What the hell... And those 100-yen ones are just fakes anyway, right?」

％Ｂ
「I think they'd be happier if it was something that was more clearly starlike.」

Sora
「...Star-shaped cookies.」
％Ｂ
「It's not a bad idea, but you'd eat them and then that'd be it... It should be something that you can keep around to remember things by.」

Sora
「...Starfish.」
％Ｂ
「...Why would someone want something from the ocean after coming to stargaze? What kinda weirdo would go to a planetarium in the cold specifically 'cause they want a starfish?」


Sora
「...Misa would.」
％Ｂ
「Oh yeah, she definitely would... Wait, that's not the point. What I'm saying is...」

all
She's pretty much okay with anything if it's an ocean creature, after all.
...Hm? Ocean creature... Ocean... Stars in the ocean...
％Ｂ
「Hey... How about something like this?」
I pull up a search window on my computer and type in what I'm thinking of.

I show Sora the image that comes up.
％Ｂ
「This.」
Sora
「...Star sand?」
％Ｂ
「It's the stuff they sell as gifts at beaches. It's star-shaped and sticks around. Wouldn't you be happy if you got something like this after seeing a meteor shower at a planetarium?」


Sora
「...I'd be happy. Very happy.」
Sora's eyes start shining like stars.
Looks like Sora likes the idea a lot too.
％Ｂ
「You could probably get a hold of this pretty easily, and it shouldn't be too expensive either. If you wanna be extreme, it's free if you just go get it from a beach that has this sand. I think this could work.」


Sora
「...*nod*」
Sora
「...Good job.」
She sticks up her thumb at me in satisfaction.
