Day four of studying for exams...
％Ｂ
「Wrong. Wrong, wrong... Wrong... Come on, we went over these formulas two days ago.」

Natsuki
「Whaaat? That's weeeird...」
％Ｂ
「This part. You substitute in this value to get the angle here, and this is the answer. There, got it?」

Natsuki
「...Probably?」
％Ｂ
「You sure? You sure you get it? You're fine now?」
Natsuki
「Uuuh... I won't even know what I really do know if you pressure me like that...」

％Ｂ
「If you don't get it, then you should just say so. I'll teach you again.」

Natsuki
「Mr. Teacher, I don't even know what I don't know anymore...」
％Ｂ
「Uh... Okay then, let's go over it again―」
all
Segawa's ineptness at mathematics is a lot more of an issue than I expected.
She occasionally forgets entire formulas.
She'll finish a problem, only to make a careless mistake.
Her performance is just plain inconsistent.
I'm pretty sure it's not 'cause she's dumb, considering she's good at memorization...

％Ｂ
「We're out of time...」
Natsuki
「Thanks for helping... I'll manage on my own for the rest. You need to study too. You've had your hands full with helping me with my stuff ever since Tuesday.」


％Ｂ
「Yeah, but...」
all
Tomorrow's Saturday, which means we don't have school.
Which means I won't be able to study with Segawa at school, obviously.\n\r
I don't just wanna leave her to study by herself in this state...
％Ｂ
「...Wanna come over tomorrow?」
Natsuki
「...Huh? ...H-Huuuuuhhh!?」
Natsuki
「C-Come over, as in... as in your house, right
, Hino

!? T-Tomorrow!? Tomorrow, as in Saturday!? Am I allowed to come over!?」

％Ｂ
「Y-Yeah... It's fine.」
There's no need to get that freaked out...
％Ｂ
「I don't think I'll be able to focus on my own studying 'cause I'll be worrying about you too much at this rate. Let's start with the basics again tomorrow.」

％Ｂ
「Oh, but are you free?」
Natsuki
「Y-Yeah... I'm totally free! I'll go for sure! I'll go first thing in the morning!」
％Ｂ
「No, please don't...」
It's Segawa, so she'd probably show up ridiculously early.
％Ｂ
「I'll spend the morning cleaning up and stuff, so come in the afternoon. All right? Afternoon. Don't come in the morning. Got it?」

Natsuki
「I-I get it. I have my own preparations I'd want to do before going to play at my boyfriend's house...」


％Ｂ
「We're studying, not playing...」
％Ｂ
「You don't know my address, right? I'll send you it over LIME. You can use a GPS app to find it. I can come pick you up if you want.」


Natsuki
「O-Okay... Got it.」
％Ｂ
「All right, let's go home then.」
