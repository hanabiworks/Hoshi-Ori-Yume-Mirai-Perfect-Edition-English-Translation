Sora designed my firm's website to have a page for blog posts.

I'm writing up a post relating to my first job as an independent architect, the remodeling of the Fukuzawa home.

I've gotten permission from Fukuzawa-san to do this, of course.

％Ｂ
「Let's see... How do I add photos...? Oh, there we go.」
I put up some before and after photos of the remodeled home.
I also put in some photos of the actual construction process, with added commentary.
％Ｂ
「And that's that.」
％Ｂ
「But... I wonder if anyone will read this blog.」
This website's for promoting the firm, but I kinda feel like no one's going to visit the blog if I don't promote the website itself...


The phone rings.
The screen reads "Azuma Architectural Firm."

％Ｂ
「...Hello?」
Azuma
『Saw the photos on your blog.』
That was fast!
％Ｂ
「Wait a second... I don't remember telling you the URL for my website.」
Azuma
『It was on the card I got for your firm opening.』
％Ｂ
「...Oh, Sora must've done that.」
Azuma
『She's got a good head on her shoulders.』
％Ｂ
「She really does. I'm very proud she's my girlfriend.」
Azuma
『And your work's not bad either. Looks like it came out pretty well. I bet Fukuzawa-san was happy about that.』


％Ｂ
「Yes, I'm glad he seemed to be satisfied. Thank you very much for introducing him to me, Teacher.」


Azuma
『You have your next job already?』
％Ｂ
「...No... Not yet.」
Azuma
『Then help us with some work.』
％Ｂ
「Wha...? No, but you've already done so much for me...」
Azuma
『No, we're the ones who want you to help. We've got a lot of stuff on our hands right now, and we won't be able to draft the blueprints in time. I'll pay you for your time, of course.』


％Ｂ
「I understand. I'll gladly help.」
Azuma
『I appreciate it. I'll send your firm the documents through email. It's not too much, so it'll be done in a snap.』

％Ｂ
「I see... Okay.」
Azuma
『Counting on you, then.』

He brusquely hangs up.
％Ｂ
「I guess it's fine, since I didn't have any work to do anyway...」
I look at my computer. He's already sent the mail.
He must've sent it before I even agreed to do it...
％Ｂ
「Uhh, let's see here...」
I don't see any attached files.
But I do see a link to a file storage site in the mail itself.

％Ｂ
「...I've got a bad feeling about this.」
I start the download, and the file size turns that feeling into something more certain.

Azuma-san said it'd be done in a snap, but this isn't going to be a walk in the park.

I check the deadline that's written in the mail...
％Ｂ
「You've gotta be kidding me... I'm gonna be working night and day for a week...」
Just typical for the Azuma Architectural Firm...
But I already said I'd do it...
％Ｂ
「Guess I've got no choice.」
％Ｂ
「Sigh... I'm tired...」
The sun hangs low in the sky.
I'll probably have to stay late every day to get this work done in time.
％Ｂ
「I should let Sora know.」
Since she might be planning on coming over and waiting to cook dinner for me.

I'll just LIME message her, since she might still be at work.
【％Ｂ】「Still at the office. #NProbably going to be #Ngoing home late #Ntonight. You don't have #Nto come over to wait #Nfor me.」
I wait a bit, but there's no response.
She might still be working after all.
I think that might be better.
I'd definitely feel bad if she were already waiting for me at home.
％Ｂ
「I think I'll go to the convenience store for now.」
I come back after picking up some boxed food and miso soup.

％Ｂ
「Crap. I don't have any water in the boiler. How stupid of me...」

I pour water in the boiler and plug it in.
％Ｂ
「Guess I'll do some work until the water's boiled.」
I sit back down and stretch.
％Ｂ
「Fhh... nnnhhhh...!」
％Ｂ
「Aaaaaahhhhhh!?」
Something suddenly wraps around my waist. 
I scream.
％Ｂ
「Wh-What the hell!?」
Sora
「...」
It's Sora...
Sora
「...You surprised me...」
％Ｂ
「Took the words right out of my mouth...」
Sora's sitting there with her eyes wide under my desk.
My scream apparently surprised her.
％Ｂ
「What are you doing down there?」
Sora
「...I wanted to surprise you.」
Well, you definitely succeeded...
％Ｂ
「When'd you get here?」
Sora
「...About fifteen minutes ago.」
％Ｂ
「So pretty much right after I went to the convenience store.」
Sora
「...I was walking over when I got your message. So I came here instead of your apartment.」

％Ｂ
「Ah, I see. Well, that's better than making you wait at my place. Teacher asked me to do some work for him, and it ended up being more than I expected. I'm probably gonna be going home pretty late.」


Sora
「...I see...」

I give a start when the office phone suddenly starts ringing.

％Ｂ
「...Yes... This is the ％Ａ Architectural Firm.」
I forcefully calm my breathing and answer the phone in business mode.
Shuuichi
『Heeeey!』
％Ｂ
「...Ugh, it's you.」
Business mode, off.
％Ｂ
「What are you calling the office for?」
Shuuichi
『I was just wondering if that address you told me before was actually your firm, you know?』

％Ｂ
「Come on... You didn't call just to check that, right...?」

Shuuichi
『No, it's not. It's about what I was talking about before.』
％Ｂ
「Before? About getting married?」
Shuuichi
『Yeah, that.』
％Ｂ
「You decide on the date? When is it?」
Shuuichi
『No, we actually don't have a date yet. I met with her parents to figure that out... but the way the story's going, we're apparently going to have a house built before the wedding.』


％Ｂ
「Huh, a wedding and your own house. Now that's a big step.」

Shuuichi
『Yeah... So I was thinking about asking you to design the house.』
％Ｂ
「...What?」
Shuuichi
『I said I wanted you to do it. Could you design a new home sweet home for Kaori and me?』

I look at Sora on reflex from the suddenness of it all.
Sora
「...?」
I never would've seen this coming...
