「...」
Sora
「...」
Sora and I are both working away in the office.
I'm doing some paperwork while staring at the office phone.

Sora's doing some miscellaneous tasks also without keeping her eyes off of the phone.

That's right...
Today's the day they announce the results of the competition.
％Ｂ
「...」
Sora
「...」
Regardless of whether I pass or fail, the result is supposed to be given to me via a phone call to this office.

％Ｂ
「...」
Sora
「...」
We don't know when the call will come.
It might be in the morning, it might be in the afternoon, or it might be at night.
Regardless, we've been preparing ourselves mentally, waiting while not really being able to focus on the work we're doing, making sure we can pick up the phone as soon as they call.

％Ｂ
「Hgh! ...That scared me...」
Sora
「...Come in.」
Sora opens the door, and Azuma-san walks in.
Azuma
「Yo, how're you doing?」
％Ｂ
「Well, I'm fine...」
Azuma
「What's wrong? You look like you're about to drop dead. You look gloomy too, Sora-chan.」

％Ｂ
「We're waiting for the call from the competition. It's supposed to come today.」


Sora
「...*nod*」
Azuma
「Really. Sounds pretty rough.」
％Ｂ
「...Yes.」
Sora
「...」
Azuma
「Oh, come on already!」
％Ｂ
「Wha?」
Azuma
「You've got a judge right here! Why don't you just ask me instead of waiting for the call?」

％Ｂ
「...Oh.」
Right.
Azuma-san's a judge for the competition.
％Ｂ
「Um... Then... How did I do?」
Sora
「...Mo-san... What were the results...?」
Azuma
「You two are both kinda slow sometimes, you know that...? Why would I come all the way here if you didn't get it?」

％Ｂ
「...」
Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「...Uh... So that means... then...」
Azuma
「Yeah... Your design was accepted as the winner of the competition.」

％Ｂ
「...Wha...」
Sora
「...!」
I look at Sora.
Sora's looking back at me, her eyes wide.
Did Azuma-san just say... that my design won...?
I had steeled myself for lots of different words today.
And to be honest, they were all the words I was expecting to hear if I didn't get it.
I was more focused on preparing myself... so I wouldn't be depressed. So I wouldn't want to give up.

That's why... I was utterly unprepared to be happy today.
all
Azuma
「Congratulations. You did great.」
I find myself unsure of whether it's okay for me to accept the handshake Azuma-san's offering me.

Azuma
「What's wrong?」
％Ｂ
「Uh... Well... It doesn't really feel real to me...」
Azuma
「God, you're so bad at this. Sora-chan, congratulate him.」

Sora
「...*nod*」
all
Sora
「...Ryou...」
％Ｂ
「...Sora...」
Sora
「...Congratulations.」
Joy wells up inside me the moment I hear her say it.
％Ｂ
「...Thank you... Sora...!」
I hug her tight.
Sora
「...Mo-san's watching...」
Azuma
「Ah... I'll look the other way for just a minute. Take that minute to let it sink in, and savor it.」

％Ｂ
「...Yes...!」
Tears well up in my eyes.
Sora
「...Congratulations.」
％Ｂ
「Mhm... mh, mhm, thank you...」
Sora
「...*shake shake* I should be the one thanking you.」
We hug, both of us teary-eyed.
The reason Azuma-san came all the way to the office wasn't just because of our previous relationship, but also to give a summary of why my design won.


Azuma
「Your design was one thing, but your name's also been in magazines a few times recently, right?」

％Ｂ
「Oh, yes. Shuuichi... I mean, a friend of mine's wife submitted the house I built for him to a magazine, and my name appeared in the article.」


Sora
「...And Natsu's photos.」
％Ｂ
「Yes, this... It's a bit embarrassing, though.」
Azuma
「Hohoh, "Twenty Amazing Architects," I see... I never got an offer to be in anything like this. But... that's quite the nice smile you've got here...」


％Ｂ
「I-I'm very sorry. I ended up in something like this over you, Teacher...」
Azuma
「I'm kidding. Anyway, the fact that your name came up in magazines twice in the last few months was a big factor.」


Azuma
「I think I told you before, but having a valued name like this comes into play for competitions too. If two submissions are equal, then they'll pick the one that's by the person who's even a little more famous.」


％Ｂ
「So then... does that mean my submission wasn't actually that good...?」

Azuma
「No, it was genuinely good. Your submission was head and shoulders above all of the others. That, I can say for sure.」


Azuma
「I'm just saying that the magazines only added to your submission. And also, you're the designer of the cultural hall that's currently in progress.」


Azuma
「You could say that this competition came about at the perfect time for you.」

％Ｂ
「Y-Yes... I think so too... I really do.」
Azuma
「And one more thing. There was a fan of yours in the judging panel.」
％Ｂ
「A... fan of mine?」
Azuma
「Fukuzawa-san. You remember him?」
％Ｂ
「Oh... Yes.」
He's the one who commissioned me for that first remodeling job I did after becoming independent.
Azuma
「He's one of the people in charge of public institutions for the city. He's been admiring your aesthetic sense for a while now. He really pushed for you to be the winner this time too.」


％Ｂ
「Really...」
Azuma
「So in terms of the end result, you completely stole the show.」
％Ｂ
「...」
Azuma
「What's wrong? You don't seem too happy.」
％Ｂ
「Well... It's just... I was just wondering if that was really okay.」
％Ｂ
「It feels like I just happened to be selected to win because my name got put in magazines, and there was someone in the judging panel who was on my side...」


Azuma
「You're saying you weren't judged fairly? That's―」
Sora
「...That's wrong...」
all
％Ｂ
「Sora...」
Sora
「...You were featured in that magazine because someone who saw the house you built thought it was incredible.」

Sora
「...You were featured in that magazine because someone who saw the house you built thought it was incredible.」

Sora
「...The reason why that person on the judging panel was a fan of you was because you did good work.」

Sora
「...The reason why that person on the judging panel was a fan of you was because you did good work.」

Sora
「The people who supported you are the ones who saw your work. It's all because of your own achievements...」

Sora
「The people who supported you are the ones who saw your work. It's all because of your own achievements...」

Sora
「So you can stand tall.」
Sora
「I'm proud of you, Ryou.」
Sora
「I'm proud of you.」
％Ｂ
「...You're right... It's because of the results I've been producing up until now... My achievements.」

all
Azuma
「...Sora-chan's already said everything I was about to say. It's like she says. You know how they say luck's a part of a person's ability, right? It's definitely not wrong.」


Azuma
「If you work hard, then there'll come times when everything works in your favor. That's what it means to be approved of by others. Have confidence in yourself.」

％Ｂ
「Teacher...」
Azuma
「By the way, about that submission of yours... What's with that marine science facility you included in there?」


％Ｂ
「Well, you did say that the city wanted to make the science museum a new city landmark, didn't you? So I was hoping we could fuse it with an institution that existed previously.」


Azuma
「...You're talking about Marinpia?」
％Ｂ
「Yes. I doubt we'd be able to reopen Marinpia itself anymore at this point... but I believe we should be able to preserve its legacy.」

％Ｂ
「I'd like to connect what was once in this city to the future, even just a little... And so I took inspiration from Marinpia for the design of the marine science facility.」


Azuma
「I get it... I get why you really won this competition now.」

Azuma
「You treated your bonds with the people of this city as precious, and tried to connect the past to the future. It's impressive work.」


％Ｂ
「Yes! Thank you very much!」
Azuma
「There's still a lot of work to do. It's up to you whether you'll be able to make this design into a reality.」

％Ｂ
「Of course! I wouldn't have made the design if it couldn't be made a reality! I'll do it for sure!」


Azuma
「Well, I'm sure you'll be fine. I'm looking forward to it.」
％Ｂ
「Yes!」
all
Sora
「...Good luck, Ryou...」
Sora
「...Good luck...」
％Ｂ
「Yeah...」
％Ｂ
「...」
Sora
「...Ryou...?」
Sora
「...?」

I take Sora to the rooftop of our alma mater that night.
％Ｂ
「It's been so long since we've seen the stars from up here.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「Hey, Sora... When you think about it, everything started here, didn't it?」
％Ｂ
「When I just happened to come here and meet you, the day before I transferred into this school.」

Sora
「...*nod*」
Sora
「...You picked up the tanzaku that I had dropped.」
Sora
「...You picked up the tanzaku that I had dropped.」
％Ｂ
「That tanzaku had "I wish I could see you again" written on it, right?」
Sora
「...My wish came true.」
She smiles happily.
％Ｂ
「A lot happened after that...」
Sora
「We watched the stars so many times here. I gave a lap pillow for the first time.」

％Ｂ
「I fell asleep midway through, though.」
Sora
「I had you eat my star cookies for the first time.」
％Ｂ
「And I confessed after that.」
Sora
「I couldn't respond right away back then.」
％Ｂ
「But I was happy just that you were considering it.」
Sora
「And this is where I gave you my response.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, and we had our first kiss here too.」
Sora
「We put together the planetarium with everyone here.」
％Ｂ
「It was so much fun. This rooftop's stuffed full of memories for us.」

％Ｂ
「There are some things that change as time passes. The old school building we all got together in is gone now. The planetarium where we had our first date's going to look different eventually.」


％Ｂ
「I'm sure that lots of other things are going to change from now on too.」
％Ｂ
「But... the night sky we can see from up here won't change. And my feelings won't ever change either.」

Sora
「...Ryou?」
Sora
「...?」
％Ｂ
「I've been thinking it over a lot. What I should say, where I should say it. And... this was the only place I could think of.」


％Ｂ
「There's no place better than here for connecting our futures together.」
I take a deep breath and stand tall.
I look Sora right in the eye.
％Ｂ
「...Ousaka Sora-san. Please marry me.」
Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「We've been boyfriend and girlfriend all this time. But from now on, I want us to be married... and live out our lives together.」

Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「Sorry for making you wait so long.」
Sora
「...*shake shake*」
Sora
「...I...」
Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「Sora?」
Sora
「...Uuh... Sniff...」
％Ｂ
「S-Sora? Did I say something to make you cry again?」

Sora
「...*shake shake*... *shake shake*...」
Sora
「...No... I'm happy... So happy...」
Sora
「...I'm happy... I have to smile, but... hgh... the tears won't stop...」

Sora
「You've supported me so much, Ryou. I could never thank you enough for as long as I live.」

Sora
「You've supported me so much. I could never thank you enough for as long as I live.」

Sora
「You gave me happiness.
You gave me my dream.
You gave me my future.」
Sora
「You gave me happiness.
You gave me my dream.
You gave me my future.」
Sora
「Every year, every day, every minute, every second that I spend with you, Ryou... It's all precious to me.」

Sora
「Every year, every day, every minute, every second that I spend with you... It's all precious to me.」

Sora
「...And that will continue forever and ever from now on...」
％Ｂ
「Sora...」
Sora
「...I... If it's okay... I want... I would like... to always be by your side, Ryou...」

Sora
「...I... If it's okay... I want... I would like... to always be by your side...」

％Ｂ
「Yeah. Be by my side. Always.」
Sora
「...*nod*... *nod*...」
Sora
「...I'll be... in your care...」
％Ｂ
「Sora...!」
I wrap my arms around her.
％Ｂ
「Sora... I love you.」
Sora
「...*nod* ...Me too... I love you too...」
The stars above watch over us as we hold each other tight.
The constellations twinkle as if to celebrate, as several shooting stars streak through the night sky.
