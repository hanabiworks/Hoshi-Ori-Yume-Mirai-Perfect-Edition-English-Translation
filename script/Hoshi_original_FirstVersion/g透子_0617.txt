Natsuki
「Now then, let's see what you've made.」

Marika
「Wooow! Wow, it looks so good... but...」
Natsuki
「Isn't this... a little too much?」
％Ｂ
「...I thought you two might eat a lot.」
I overdid it.
I tried my best to make something good, and ended up making so much it'd be kinda tough even for three guys to eat all of it.

％Ｂ
「A-Anyway, let's eat! Don't worry, we'll get through it in no time once we start!」


Marika
「Ehehe, let's eat!」
Natsuki
「Let's eeeat! I'm grabbing some fried chicken! Hamh... Mmmh, delicious! What the heck, this is delicious!」

Marika
「...Yeah, it's really good! You're really good at cooking!」

％Ｂ
「No, I just looked up a recipe and followed what it said. And you know how I live alone right now. I'm learning all this out of necessity.」


I'm glad it looks like the food came out good.
Seeing Shinozaki and Segawa smile as they eat is reassuring.
％Ｂ
「So yeah, anyway...」
Natsuki
「Marika, you have to try this! It's too good! Way too good! I could eat this all day!」

Marika
「Mh... You're right, it is good! Ehehe, I think I might be in heaven.」
...Wait, are they too engrossed in lunch to hear me?
Did I put too much effort in...?
Natsuki
「You made such good food... We're gonna get fat if we eat all this! What do you think you're doing!?」

％Ｂ
「What!? That's my fault!?」
Marika
「Ahhh... I'm starting to get full.」
Natsuki
「What the heck!? Marika, how small's your stomach!? Are you trying to act cute!?」

Marika
「N-No I'm nooot... I ate a lot, you knooow...」

Natsuki
「You're making me look like I eat a ton...! Mmh, this fried egg's pretty good too.」

％Ｂ
「Shinozaki, you're not gonna get bigger if you don't eat more.」
Marika
「Wh-Whaaat!? But I can't just...! But I've already gotten pretty big...」

She looks down at her own chest.
At her two soft-looking breasts.
％Ｂ
「Wh-What are you talking about!? That's not what I meant!」
Natsuki
「I seeee... So that's what you think about when you cook for girls
, Hino

?」

％Ｂ
「N-No, I don't! Stop looking at me like that, Segawa!」
Natsuki
「I hear it's good to have other people rub them. Want me to do it?」

Marika
「Auuuh... That's embarrassing...!」
Natsuki
「It's fine if we're both girls, isn't it? I wanted to rub your boobs 'til I was satisfied when I saw them at the hot springs.」


Marika
「D-Did you really!? Segawa-san, your eyes are scaryyy!」

Natsuki
「Ahahah! I'm going to take your first, Marika!」
Marika
「Kyaah! S-Segawa-saaan! Nooo, help meee!」
...What the heck?
I can't get started!
all
Natsuki
「Now that we're full... Let's start our advice column.」

％Ｂ
「...Thank you very much.」
It's finally time to start talking.
We've finished the food by the time I'm done talking about the current situation and my feelings.

Natsuki
「This kinda stuff's all about momentum! I'm sure Touko's waiting for you to confess! Just tell her!」

Marika
「Um... I think it's better to gradually create a nice mood. Pick a nice spot... I'd want you to say your feelings in a romantic way.」


％Ｂ
「...You guys are saying the exact opposite things.」
Natsuki
「If it were me, I'd want you to just say it upfront without trying to be indirect.」
Marika
「You think so...? She might not take you seriously if you confess to her out of nowhere.」

％Ｂ
「Oh yeah, I could see that. Like she'd just assume it's a joke and that's the end of that.」
Natsuki
「That'd only happen because you lacked impact. You have to be more like... Grab her shoulders, look her into the eyes, and tell her you like her!」


Marika
「Wh-Why are you confessing to me!? Nooo, you're making my heart beat fast!」

Natsuki
「And then just keep going with a mmmchuuu～! Here, Marika! Chuuu～!」

Marika
「Wh-Whaaat!? I-I don't want thiiis...! We're both girls...!」

％Ｂ
「...」
Natsuki
「Hey!? What are you taking photos for!? This isn't for free, cough it up!」

Marika
「That's not the issue heeere! Segawa-san, let go of meee!」
％Ｂ
「Segawa, Shinozaki's kinda freaking out. And let me keep talking.」
Natsuki
「I was just trying to lighten the mood a little. Learn to understand my humor.」

Please stop with the unnecessary humor.
Though I might be at fault for taking a photo too.
％Ｂ
「...Anyway. So actually... there's one more big problem.」
Natsuki
「Huh? A big problem? What's that?」
％Ｂ
「You two probably already know about how they're talking about opening up the old school building for the Tanabata Festival, right? It's kinda related to that.」


Marika
「What? What... do you mean?」
％Ｂ
「The thing is... Yukimura and I have been meeting after school in the old school building.」
Natsuki
「Wha? That place is off limits, isn't it? How'd you get in?」

％Ｂ
「Yukimura's got a key. I just happened to find out... and we've been meeting there and talking ever since.」

Natsuki
「You're alone together in the old school building after school... It's the best mood maker possible! You've been with her in that juicy a situation this whole time and still haven't confessed?」


％Ｂ
「A-A lot's happened! I've been trying real hard to recruit her to the event committee too!」

Natsuki
「Which is more important to you between confessing and recruiting!?」
％Ｂ
「...There's some kinda order to how you do things, right? It's not like I've felt this way from the start.」

Marika
「I wonder why she has a key to the old school building? Yukimura-san transferred in only a little before 

Hino-kun 
you 
did.」
Natsuki
「Maybe she found it somewhere... but probably not. Now that I think about it... I feel like I heard a rumor about how a key to the old school building went missing a looong time ago...」


Marika
「The old school building might be an important place for Yukimura-san... so you want to do something about that for her?」

％Ｂ
「Well... pretty much.」
Natsuki
「...Argghhh, what the heck! There's no point in just thinking about it! Go charge against her and break yourself apart!」

％Ｂ
「...I'm asking for advice 'cause I don't wanna break apart.」
Marika
「A-Ahaha... You're right. Segawa-san, let's think about this properly for him.」

Natsuki
「I did think about it! Nothing's gonna happen if you don't tell her how you feel, right!?」

Marika
「Confessing out of nowhere's just going to surprise her... I'm sure Yukimura-san would want him to create the proper mood before he tells her how he feels.」


Their opinions circle around.
I can understand both their perspectives... which is why it's all the more difficult to decide what the best choice is.

Judging from Yukimura's personality... I feel like Shinozaki's plan of "creating a good mood" would work better.

But I also think it wouldn't work if I took too much time...
Natsuki
「Oh, lunch break is over.」
％Ｂ
「Oh... Guess we were eating for too long.」
Marika
「I'm sorry, we weren't any help at all...」
％Ｂ
「Nah, don't worry about it. I was able to organize how I feel by talking things through.」

Natsuki
「Either way, you don't need tricks for romance! Push, push, push like crazy, and give it your best shot! You push with everything you've got!」


％Ｂ
「Owwww!? Wh-What the hell was that for!?」
Natsuki
「It's to get some conviction in you! Slam the fighting spirit right in! You can do anything if you've got the energy!」

She slapped me right on the back.
It stings like crazy!
all
％Ｂ
「Hmm... What should I tell her...」
I arrive at the usual classroom while I'm mulling things over in my head.
I guess I should start by telling her the current situation...
％Ｂ
「...Wait, no one's here? ...Is she in one of the other classrooms?」
She should be somewhere in this building. The door was unlocked.
Guess I'll walk around and look for her.
％Ｂ
「Where'd she go...?」
I tried looking through the old school building, but I didn't see Yukimura anywhere.
I came back to the classroom because I thought she might've come back while I was out, but it's still deserted.

％Ｂ
「Her bag is here, so I don't think she's gone home...」

I thought she might've gone to the bathroom, but it's been way too long.
She might have other things to do in the bathroom as a girl, but it'd be rude to try to imagine that... so let's not.

％Ｂ
「Hmm... Well, this works for me. I'll get my thoughts in order while I wait.」

％Ｂ
（Nh... Huh? There's... something touching me?）
I can feel something on my face.
I slowly open my eyes.
Touko
「Hey, morning. This place is quiet and good for sleeping, isn't it?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah... Sorry, I fell asleep.」
Touko
「Take this.」
％Ｂ
「...Nmh.」
Touko
「Ahahah! "Nmh"! Take this, and this!」
％Ｂ
「S-Stop that...! It tickles!」
Touko
「You mess with me while I'm asleep too, don't you? This is payback.」

％Ｂ
「I-I don't do anything... That'd be sexual harassment...」
Touko
「Mmm... I wouldn't want my boobs or butt touched, but I think having my cheeks poked or something would be fine.」

％Ｂ
「Wha...?」
Touko
「Because you're the only other person who comes here, so I'd know who it was right away. But that doesn't mean you can plan anything dirty, okay?」

So does that mean... she's lowering her guard around me to some extent?
She wouldn't let someone she doesn't like do that, right?
Touko
「So what are you here for today? Naptime?」
％Ｂ
「Oh, no... I'm here to talk to you...」
Touko
「About the event committee again? Ahaha, you're really persistent, aren't you?」

She smiles happily.
I just can't help but feel... that Yukimura interacts with me differently than with others.

Touko
「I've already told you I wouldn't be of any use. You're kinda weird, you know that?」

％Ｂ
「...That's not what it's about. I don't really care about whether you'll be useful... I want you to have fun. That's all.」

Touko
「Why so passionate? It's... not like my feelings mean anything for you, right?」

It's because... I'm interested in her.
If I were to put those feelings into words, then it's because I "like" her.
Touko
「Well, either way, I'd get bored right away. I've never done one thing for too long.」

％Ｂ
「...」
Touko
「Anyway, is it okay for you to just be sleeping here? Aren't you busy?」

％Ｂ
「No, it's fine. I apparently don't have much work today.」
Touko
「...Hmm. I see.」
She doesn't seem particularly interested.
I need to think of a topic that'll draw her interest. Otherwise, I don't think this'll continue for much longer.

Charge and break apart.
Create a nice mood.
Maybe I should go with momentum, just like Segawa said!?
Thinking about it, that might be the right choice for someone like Yukimura, who always slips away no matter how much I prepare beforehand.

All right. I'm gonna say it!
I repeat the words over and over in my heart to strengthen my resolve.
％Ｂ
「Yukimura!」
Touko
「Wah!? Wh-What!?」
％Ｂ
「I, I...!」
Crap! I don't have enough breath to keep going 'cause I was so nervous!
I need to take a deep breath and tell her how I...!
Touko
「Icecart!」
％Ｂ
「Wha...?」
Touko
「It's "T" next. Come on, you'll lose if you don't come up with something in five seconds.」

％Ｂ
「"T"...!?」
Touko
「Oh, okay, tea... Then I'll go with apple, as in summer apple!」
Wh-What's going on!?
We're suddenly playing shiritori!?
Touko
「Five, four, three, two...」
％Ｂ
「Whoa!? "E," "E"... Egg!」
Touko
「Egg... I guess they do say eggs are a summertime ingredient. "G," "G"... Goya! I hear that's a summer vegetable. Though I don't like it because it's bitter.」

％Ｂ
「Wha, wait a second! Why are we suddenly playing shiritori!?」

Touko
「Was I wrong? I thought we were doing shiritori with only summertime stuff.」
％Ｂ
「No! And why's it only summertime stuff!?」
Touko
「You just don't get it, do you? Putting in restrictions like this is how adults play the game. It's your turn. "A."」


％Ｂ
「No, I didn't wanna play this!」
Touko
「Mmm... If you lose, I'll take an embarrassing photo of you, and send it through LIME. How about that?」

％Ｂ
「Excuse me!? Wh-What the heck are you saying!?」
Touko
「C'mon now, hurry. Five, four, three...」
％Ｂ
「Aaaaaaaghhh! "A," "A"... Abalone! You know, like something you'd find in the ocean!?」

Touko
「Mhm, mhm, I get it. Then I'll go with... eel! The ocean, and it's a summertime food!」

％Ｂ
「"L," "L"... Lake! 'Cause you go swimming in lakes too!」
Touko
「"E" agaaain!? You're really mean... "E," "E"... Um... Evenings! Like evening festivals!」

all
Touko
「Ahh, I'm tired. I'm kinda getting bored of this.」
I ended up getting pretty serious about playing shiritori with her.
Looks like I'll be able to avoid having an embarrassing photo taken of me.
％Ｂ
「Aghh!? It's already this late!?」
Touko
「Oh dear, time to go home. You should go home too, or else you'll get yelled at.」

％Ｂ
「Sigh... Ugh. No good today either.」
She just deflects momentum-based approaches.
This isn't gonna work...
％Ｂ
「...I'm going home.」
Touko
「Sure thiiing, lateeer. Maybe we should try playing tag or something next time.」

all
I remember Shinozaki's advice.
If I create the proper mood and tell her how I feel... then my feelings might get through to her.

Segawa said this classroom would be perfect for a confession too.\n\r

I should use these advantages to the fullest.
But... the question is... how do I create that mood?
Let's see... What do I have to do to create a mood in the first place?
I have zero experience in that regard. I have no idea.
Touko
「...What? Is there something on my face?」
％Ｂ
「Wha!? Oh, uh... No, there isn't.」
Touko
「You're making me worry, staring at me silently like that. You probably shouldn't do things like that to girls, you know.」

Huh, this response... That's strange.
She seems a little uneasy. I haven't seen a response like this from her yet.
％Ｂ
「...」
Touko
「...Um, if you have something to say, then why don't you say it?」

Maybe... this could work?
I feel like the mood's changed somehow in the classroom too.
It definitely feels like something's different from usual.
Touko
「Hgh... What's wrong? You're so quiet... You were the one who said you wanted to talk, right?」

I've now learned that not saying anything is another form of communication.
I guess just silently staring at someone's pretty effective for creating a good mood.

％Ｂ
「...You see.」
Touko
「Huh!? Wh-What!?」
％Ｂ
「I came here to talk about something important. Could you listen to what I have to say?」

Touko
「...Does that have to be right now? I don't like serious stuff, and I don't really feel like it right now.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah. I wanna talk about it now.」
Touko
「It's about the event committee, right? I've already said no...」
％Ｂ
「No. I wanna talk about that too, but this is something more personal.」
Touko
「...」
％Ｂ
「I've realized something. I've been trying to make excuses for it and stuff... but I just wanna be with you.」

Touko
「You're with me right now, so isn't that fine? I don't think there's anything more to say.」

％Ｂ
「I wanna be closer to you. I want to see the same things you see, feel the same things you feel... I wanna build up our memories together.」

Touko
「...」
％Ｂ
「You want to make lots of fun memories too, don't you? So...」

Touko
「This is fine. Any more than this... is too heavy and tiring.」

％Ｂ
「Wha...?」
Touko
「I'm not used to it. I've only ever been transferring around this whole time... I'm really bad with things like that.」

Her expression changes from a complex one to a simple one.
I think this simple expression's her "giving up."
Touko
「So I'm sorry about this... but I'll have to pass on that. You wouldn't want to talk about something tiring in a place where you're comfortable, would you?」


％Ｂ
「...」
...Should I push harder?
But I feel like... I wouldn't be able to set foot in here ever again if I failed.

...No. I can't be afraid.
I've gotten this far. All I need to do is tell her properly how I feel.

I'll never be able to move forward if I keep looking backward!
％Ｂ
「Yukimura, I...!」
Touko
「...Looks like it's time to go home. Let's do this some other time.」
％Ｂ
「Oh...」
all
She walks swiftly past me.
Leaving me alone in the classroom.
It might've just been me seeing things... but her cheeks looked a little red.

【Natsuki】「How'd it go? Did you #Nconfess to Touko?」
They gave me advice, so I should tell them how it went.
【％Ｂ】「No. She kinda turned #Nthe conversation away #Nfrom it.」
【％Ｂ】「I'll try again.」
【Marika】「You mean you didn't get #Nto tell her properly?」
【％Ｂ】「I didn't. She got away.」
【Marika】_st_0107
【Marika】「Good luck!」
【Natsuki】「You can talk to us #Nagain if you need help.」
【Natsuki】_st_0201
【％Ｂ】「That'd be great.」
【％Ｂ】「I'm gonna try a little #Nmore on my own first.」
...I wonder if Yukimura'll listen to what I have to say tomorrow.
