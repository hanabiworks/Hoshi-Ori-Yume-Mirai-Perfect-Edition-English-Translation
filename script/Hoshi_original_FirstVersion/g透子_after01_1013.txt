Touko
「I'm going, then...!」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. Good luck. I'm sure you'll do fine if you make good use of everything you've learned so far.」

It's the day of Touko's first interior design coordinator qualification exam.
We did everything we could to prepare her for this, given the limited time we had...
％Ｂ
「If you get lost, then just stay calm and thoroughly reread the question. Watch out for trick questions, all right?」

Touko
「M-Mhm...! Wait, do I have my admission ticket...? It's supposed to be in here, right...!?」

all
Hmm... She seems really nervous.
She probably won't be able to make full use of her studying like this.
％Ｂ
「Here. I made you lunch. Take this with you.」
Touko
「Oh, mhm... Thanks... Um, writing supplies... reference book and workbook... Huh? Did it get caught between something somewhere...!?」


Can't have her like this before she even leaves the house.
I remember what we did before I left for my exam. I need to do what I can for her.
％Ｂ
「One more thing, Touko. Mmh.」
Touko
「Mmmh...」
A short, light brush of the lips.
I can feel her lips trembling slightly against mine.
％Ｂ
「It's a good luck charm. You did it for me too, right? Now it's my turn to do it for you.」

Touko
「...I had no idea that was this effective.」
％Ｂ
「Haha, it really saved me too. I guess doing things "the same as usual" isn't something to make light of.」

Our daily kisses are useful in times like these.
Touko looks completely calmed down now, and the tension's left her shoulders too.

Touko
「Oh, I found it! My admission ticket! Ehehe... Thanks. I think I'll be able to stay calm for my exam thanks to that. Okaaay, I'll do my best!」


all
It's finally evening after a long day of waiting.
It's almost time for Touko to come home.
She sent me a message earlier telling me that her exam was done, and that she was coming home.
I asked her how she did, but she told me she'd tell me about it once she got home, so I've been waiting for her...

％Ｂ
「I wonder how it went...」
I can't help but worry.
I tried to take my mind off of it with housework, but I didn't get anything done.
...I'm more anxious about this than I was for my own exams.
Touko
「I'm hooome～... Sigh... I'm tired～」
％Ｂ
「Oh, you're back! Welcome home! How'd you do!?」

Touko
「Ahaha, I did everything I could, buuut... Oh, I answered all the questions, though!」

I'd hope so. It's the bare minimum for taking an exam in the first place.
It isn't something to act so proud about.
％Ｂ
「...You didn't roll your pencil to guess your answers, right?」
Touko
「...I didn't?」
％Ｂ
「Oh, you totally freakin' did! I told you so many times not to do that!」

I can't believe she was directly responsible for the clattering of a rolling pencil in a silent exam hall...
I heard people do that a few times during my exams. It's actually really distracting...

Touko
「I had toooo... I didn't know the answer after thinking about it, so I had to leave it to luck! I had a pencil, and it was multiple choice, so they were pretty much telling me it was okay!」


％Ｂ
「You can leave it to luck, but you can't roll pencils! Ugh... Did you make sure to bring the questions back with you?」

Touko
「Mhm. I wrote down what I put as my answers too.」
％Ｂ
「We'll check over your answers tomorrow. Let's just relax for today.」

Touko
「Mm, that sounds good. Ahhh～ I'm hungryyy～...! Maybe I'll cook for the first time in a while today.」

％Ｂ
「It's fine, I'll do it. You're tired after your exam, right?」

Touko
「No, could you let me do it? It makes me happy when you do it for me, but I've actually been on edge this whole time because I wanted to cook.」


％Ｂ
「Huh?」
Touko
「Ehehe... Because I like cooking for you
, Ryousuke

. Now then! What do we have in the fridge?」

She walks over to the kitchen and immediately starts getting ready to cook.
I watch her as I make a small wish.
％Ｂ
「...I hope you passed.」
