After school.
We're heading to the second chemistry classroom with Yukimura and Narusawa in tow, to start our preparations for the Tanabata Festival.

Touko
「And why do we have to come too?」
％Ｂ
「Okihara-senpai says she wants to thank you guys properly too, 'cause you helped out a lot.」


Rikka
「I didn't really help. I just gave you my opinion.」
％Ｂ
「That's helpful enough.」
％Ｂ
「Excuse me. Okihara-senpai, here they are.」
Misa
「Oh... Yukimura-san! Narusawa-san!」
Touko
「Wha...」
The moment Okihara-senpai spots the two of them, she suddenly moves forward―

Rikka
「Kyah!?」
And of course, embraces them both at the same time.
Touko
「Huh? Huh?」
Rikka
「E-Excuse me...?」
And of course, Yukimura and Narusawa look utterly bewildered.
Natsuki
「Mmm, nice expressions.」
And Segawa's happily taking photos.
Misa
「Thank you so very much for helping us realize my idea, you two!」

Touko
「Oh... Sure...」
Misa
「And you gave such wonderful advice... It's thanks to you that our plan has been approved!」

Rikka
「Oh no, that's not...」
Misa
「I apologize for having you come all the way here. I just had to thank you directly. Thank you so, so very much!」


Touko
「Uh huh...」
Rikka
「Likewise... Thank you very much, I think?」
Marika
「Narusawa-san and Yukimura-san look like they don't know what to do...」
Sora
「...Because it's soft.」
all
％Ｂ
「Hm?」
Sora
「Misa's boobs are soft when she squeezes you.」
％Ｂ
「Ah...」
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.
all
％Ｂ
「Now then, Okihara-senpai, let's wrap up the thanks for now, and start planning things.」

And so, our meeting to discuss our preparations for the Tanabata Festival begins.
Misa
「Then I will now explain our plans for the future.」
Rikka
「...Why... Why are we still here?」
Touko
「...No idea? But it sounds interesting, so we might as well listen.」
Misa
「There are, in general, two things I would like to prepare for the Tanabata Festival: water tanks, and fish.」

Misa
「Let's begin with the fish. I would like to gather fish that are being brought here by migratory fish death.」

％Ｂ
「Migratory fish death?」
Touko
「What's that? Fish death? So we're going to gather up dead fish? Is this going to be a sashimi thing?」

Misa
「W-We will not be eating them! Migratory fish death refers to a phenomenon where tropical and subtropical fish ride the Kuroshio current to Japan.」


Misa
「As these fish are not normally migratory, they are unable to return to their native habitats. They die when the environment here worsens and becomes unable to sustain them.」


Natsuki
「So that's why it's called migratory fish death.」
Marika
「I feel a bit sorry for them...」
Misa
「Though survival of the fittest is the law of nature, it can be difficult to accept. And so it would be nice if we could gather up many of them before winter comes.」

Misa
「And as the migratory fish death phenomenon brings in fish that have essentially lost their way, capturing them will have little effect on the local ecosystem.」

Misa
「And they are of course tropical fish, so they are vividly colored and very beautiful to behold.」

Marika
「That sounds wonderful!」
Rikka
「That seems too easy...」
Misa
「As for capturing them, I would like to go see first if the fish we are after are there. It would simplify things afterward.」


Misa
「And I would like to prepare the water tanks at the same time. The fish we capture must have homes.」

Touko
「Can't we just use tap water for the tanks?」
％Ｂ
「They're marine fish. You'd have to put in salt water. We can probably just draw it up from the ocean, right?」

Misa
「No, we will be using tap water for this.」
％Ｂ
「No way...」
Touko
「Hm, hmm!」
Misa
「We certainly could use salt water from the source, but that would require many extra steps to ensure sanitation. And most importantly, it would be a hassle to carry it over.」


Natsuki
「Hear that? This is your chance to show off as a man. One ton, two tons, no problem, right?」

％Ｂ
「...I am not a truck.」
Misa
「And so we will be using artificial salt water. It will be made by mixing materials into regular tap water.」

Misa
「Of course, we cannot simply use tap water as is.」

Misa
「We will of course have to remove the chlorinated elements, and we will also have to culture bacteria in order to create a comfortable environment for the fish.」


Misa
「The sand we place at the bottom will also not be commercial grade. We will have to put in some effort to make it as supportive as possible for the fish.」


Rikka
「This seems like a lot of work...」
Touko
「But Jellyfish-senpai looks like she's having fun. Look at her eyes light up.」

Yukimura's right. Okihara-senpai's eyes are glittering. She's really come alive.

I can hardly believe this is the same kinda-ditzy person from earlier who'd hug anyone and everyone on reflex from happiness.

％Ｂ
「It's like she's a teacher, and we're her students.」
Touko
「Ahaha, you're right!」
Misa
「And so, the term for a tank designed for the raising and cultivation of fish and aquatic vegetation would be―」



Sora
「...I know.」
Misa
「Yes, Sora-san.」
Sora
「...An aquarium.」
Misa
「Correct♪」
Rikka
「...It really is like a class.」
％Ｂ
「Y-Yeah.」
all
Misa
「As an aside, the word aquarium comes from "aqua" for water, and "arium" for "place," or "facility."」
Misa
「An "aquarium" is a "place" for "water." In the case that this is adapted for outer space, it would be familiar to all of you as―」


Sora
「...I know.」
Misa
「Yes, Sora-san again.」
Sora
「...Planetarium.」
Misa
「Correct♪」
Okihara-senpai's aquarium lecture continued on for some time after that.
％Ｂ
「Err... Now that Okihara-senpai's seminar is done, I think we should decide who's in charge of what for preparations.」

％Ｂ
「Like Okihara-sensei... I mean, Okihara-senpai said earlier, there are two main things we need to prepare. The fish and the water tanks.」


％Ｂ
「I'm just going to decide the roles on my own judgment.」
Natsuki
「Boooo! Okihara-sensei, our class president's abusing his authority!」
％Ｂ
「...Why am I class president?」
all
％Ｂ
「Ahem. Err, first off, Okihara-senpai, Shinozaki, Segawa, and I will be in charge of the fish. Ousaka, Narusawa, and Yukimura will do the water tanks.」

Touko
「What? No, wait a second. Why are our names in there as well?」

％Ｂ
「Hm? What's the problem?」
Touko
「What are you just casually dragging us into this for?」
％Ｂ
「You're making me sound like the bad guy here. I'm just depending on you two for your cooperative, charitable, and kind hearts.」


Touko
「We're going to seem like real villains if we say no now that you've put it that way...」


Rikka
「...I don't really mind helping.」
Touko
「What!? Really!?」
Rikka
「I have the time... and I'm already kind of involved in this.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, there you go, Narusawa. Now you're talking.」
Touko
「Ughh... Now it's even harder for me to say no... Sigh... Okay, fine. I'll help, whatever.」

％Ｂ
「Yep. I knew I could count on you, Yukimura.」
Touko
「...You know, you're really talented at forcing people into things.」
Misa
「Thank you all so very much for agreeing to help. I'm so happy that I could simply sweep all of you off your feet into a hug right this very moment!」


Rikka
「Please, we've had our fill.」
Misa
「I see... That's a shame...」
％Ｂ
「Now, now. Let's not get down. Let's plan out what we're doing.」

Misa
「Then the fish team will go take a look at a few capture spots tomorrow. Once we confirm the presence of the fish we are looking for, we can go capture them on the weekend.」


Misa
「And would it be okay for the water tanks to be prepared simultaneously, on Saturday?」

Touko
「Saturday... That's fine by me.」
Rikka
「I'm free that day too.」
all
Sora
「...No issues.」

Marika
「I'm sorry, I have work in the morning that day～」
Natsuki
「I have to take photos at the basketball game that morning, so I think I'd only be able to show up for the afternoon.」

％Ｂ
「So that means there's no issues with the water tank team, but the fish team is just going to be Okihara-senpai and me in the morning... I'm sure it'll be fine.」

all
Misa
「I look forward to working with all of you, to prepare for the Tanabata Festival!」
