The next day.
Sora wanted us to go to the planetarium again.
$$smh_OpenCHK
The cardboard-gathering's going well, and we found a job too.
But there's still something more we have to do.

Sora
「...」
A planetarium isn't just about projecting stars onto a dome. Sora's going to be talking about the stars to the guests at the Tanabata Festival.


But Sora's worried about how she wants to talk about the stars.\n\r

The way she talks about them to me... is apparently something different for her.
And so we're here at the planetarium to get some ideas from the people who do the professional explanations.

Narration
「Now then, let's look next to the southern skies. You can see a bright red star directly to the south. There are two other stars diagonally upward and diagonally downward.」


The program's changed since last time.
Narration
「This star is Antares in Scorpio. It appears red just like Mars. In Greek, Mars is known as Ares, the god of war.」


Narration
「Antares's name comes from its nature as a star which competes with the god Ares, Anti-Ares.」

Sora
「...」
Narration
「One can see a large S-shaped formation of stars around Antares. Can you see the bent tail and raised pincers of the scorpion?」


...Weird.
Sora's already told me about Antares.
The content's the same, but this narration just seems a lot easier on the ears...

Sora
「...」
Sora seems to be focusing on that too. She's looking more at the lady doing the narration than at the stars.

Narration
「Let's follow Scorpio's tail, and then continue moving a little to the east in that direction. You can see how the Milky Way gets brighter here.」


Narration
「This is the direction of the center of our galaxy, the Milky Way.」
Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「How was it? Useful?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
Sora
「...I might not be able to mimic it. But it was very useful.」

％Ｂ
「I see. What are you planning on talking about for the festival?」
Sora
「...It's the Tanabata Festival, so I'm going to talk about summer constellations, focusing on the Milky Way, Orihime, and Hikoboshi.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, figures. Let me know if there's anything you need. I'll help you with anything.」


Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「Okay... Now then. What do you wanna do now?」
Sora
「...I want to go to your house.」



％Ｂ
「Wha...? You sure?」
Sora
「...I want to make food again.」
％Ｂ
「Seriously? That'd be awesome. What are you gonna make today?」

Sora
「...It was omurice last time, so today is Japanese food.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, I like how that sounds.」
Sora
「...I want to get groceries today, so we'll go to the supermarket.」
％Ｂ
「Roger that. Let's go, then.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
all
％Ｂ
「That was great!」
Today was rice, miso soup, grilled fish, pickled roots, simmered seaweed, and an amazing nikujaga.\n\r

All handmade by Sora.
％Ｂ
「It was all delicious. You're so good at cooking.」

Sora
「..Thanks.」
％Ｂ
「I wanna eat food this good forever.」
Sora
「...Forever...」
I said it without really thinking, but Sora goes red.
％Ｂ
「...Oh, uh... I didn't mean anything in particular by that, uh... Yeah... Well yeah, I think I do wanna eat it forever.」

Sora
「..*nod*」
She nods silently, her face still red.
％Ｂ
「Uhh... Wh-What do you wanna do after this?」
Sora
「...I'm going to your room.」



％Ｂ
「Uh... My room?」
So that means...
Sora
「...There's something I want to look up on your computer. I can't do it at home, so I want to look it up here.」

％Ｂ
「Oh... So that's what you meant...」
Sora
「...What do you mean?」
％Ｂ
「No, no, nothing! Just talking to myself!」
I'm on my bed, looking up stuff about stars on my phone as Sora uses my computer.

％Ｂ
「...」
I can't stop glancing at her.
I wonder if her coming to my room means she's okay with doing it.
Then again, Sora's doing some kind of serious research.\n\r
She's probably figured something out after going to the planetarium today.
Let's focus on the Tanabata Festival for now, without thinking dirty thoughts.
all
％Ｂ
「...」
And besides, Sora looked like she was in a lot of pain last time.
I don't think my thing's particularly big, it's just that Sora's small.
I don't want to give her a bad impression of doing it. I shouldn't try too hard to get her to do it a second time.
I should be the gentleman here and keep myself in check.
Sora
「...Hm...」
％Ｂ
「Mm? What's up?」
Sora
「...I'm learning a lot.」
％Ｂ
「Oh yeah... About stars?」
Sora
「...About positions.」
％Ｂ
「...Positions...?」
What's she talking about?
％Ｂ
「...The heck are you looking at?」
I get off the bed and look at the monitor.
％Ｂ
「...It's a porn site...」
So this is why she said she couldn't do it at home...
Sora
「...It hurt last time because it was the first time, so I wanted to look up how to make it hurt less.」

Actually, Sora isn't looking at an actual porn site. She's looking at a how-to page for sex.

So... this means...
Sora
「...It apparently hurts less to do it from behind.」
％Ｂ
「U-Uh, Sora...」
Sora
「...Are you holding yourself back?」
％Ｂ
「Wha...?」
Sora
「...You haven't tried to do anything since the first time. If you're holding back because you're worried about my body, you shouldn't.」

％Ｂ
「N-No, I'm not holding back...」
Sora
「...Then that means you don't find my body attractive...」
％Ｂ
「No way! You're super attractive! It-It's just... I don't really know when the right time is to go about bringing stuff like that up, so uh...」


She's right that I was thinking that we shouldn't force it too much, because of how much pain she was in, and that blood...

Sora
「...If you want to do it
, Ryou

, then I think that's the right time.」
％Ｂ
「Sora...」
I hug her gently from behind.
％Ｂ
「Aghh... I admit defeat... Yeah, I was holding myself back... but it's only because you're important to me.」


Sora
「...*nod* I know that very well.」
Sora
「...But there's no need to hold yourself back. Because I'm your girlfriend

, Ryou

...」
She smiles.
Sora
「...And hugging each other when we're naked feels really good. I really like it...」

％Ｂ
「...Then... I won't hold myself back. I'm gonna do what I want to do. Is that okay?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
She nods bashfully in my arms.
