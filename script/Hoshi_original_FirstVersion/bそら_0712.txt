I woke up early this morning to thoroughly clean the entire house.
Sora's coming over to discuss the planetarium today.

％Ｂ
「All right... This should be fine.」
This'll be the second time Sora's come over.
The last time was when Segawa and Shinozaki suddenly brought her with when they came to see how I was doing after I got sick.

Which means today'll be the first time Sora comes over by herself.

That's right─my "girlfriend" comes over for the first time today.
％Ｂ
「Phew... I'm pretty nervous...」
She said she'd come at around lunchtime, so I guess she should be here soon...
％Ｂ
「She...She's here...!」
I open the door. Sora's standing there in her casual clothes.
Sora
「...Hello.」
％Ｂ
「W-Welcome. Come on in.」
Sora
「...Please excuse me.」
Sora seems nervous too.
She's sounding a lot more formal than usual.
％Ｂ
「Uh, you fine coming up to my room?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
I lead Sora up to my room.
Which I've also tidied up, of course.
％Ｂ
「I'll go get us something to drink. You can sit anywhere.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「I'll be right back.」
all
I go downstairs to get some bottled water, tea, and snacks. I come back up to find Sora sitting stiffly in front of the table, looking nervous.


％Ｂ
「Is tea fine?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
Sora
「...No need to worry about me.」
％Ｂ
「R-Right... You know, you don't have to be so nervous.」
Sora
「...I don't... think I'm nervous... Am I?」
％Ｂ
「You're as stiff as a board.」
Sora
「...Really... I thought I'd be fine because I've been here before already...」
She seems confused at the fact that she's nervous.
％Ｂ
「It's fine. Just relax as much as you're able.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「All right. Let's start.」
all
We sit across from each other at the glass coffee table to start discussing the planetarium dome.

Sora
「...Look at this first.」
She pulls something out from her bag.
It looks like it's made out of cardstock.
％Ｂ
「...What's that?」
Sora
「...This is the dome opened up. I tried making this last night after I got home.」

％Ｂ
「Wha... You mean you made this?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
It's comprised of twelve cardstock isosceles triangles.
Actually, they look like triangles at first glance, but the equal-length sides are slightly curved.

Sora splits the triangles into three groups to form two trapezoids and a triangle.

Sora
「...And they come together like this.」
She wraps the bases of the three parts into each other to form rings.
She ends up with a big, thick ring, a smaller, narrower ring, and a wider one with a closed bottom, like a plate.

She places the smaller ring on top of the thicker one, and places the plate-shaped one on top like a lid.\n\r

They form a small hemispherical dome about twenty centimeters in diameter.
all
％Ｂ
「Ohh! That's awesome!」
Sora
「...This is the planetarium dome we'll try to make.」
％Ｂ
「Wow, you managed to make something like this?」
Sora
「...It's designed so anyone can make it if they do the calculations right.」
％Ｂ
「Anyone? ...I like to think I'm pretty good at making architectural models, but I've never done anything that's put together like this... Huh... I wouldn't have ever considered a design like this.」


I would've gone straight for support pillars and braces.
Sora
「...If we make the actual dome in the same way, we'll be able to make it using just cardboard.」

％Ｂ
「This is about twenty centimeters in diameter, so a six-meter-diameter one would be thirty times bigger... I already knew we were going to need a lot of cardboard, but still...」


I take another good look at Sora's model dome.
％Ｂ
「This is kind of like an igloo.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「Hmm...」
Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「...」
...Uh?
The conversation's kinda stopped...
％Ｂ
「Uhh... I thought these were isosceles triangles at first, but it looks like they're actually a little curved.」

Sora
「...*nod*」
Sora
「...The edges that don't form the base have a slight curve. It's like looking at a bamboo shoot from the side.」

％Ｂ
「Oh... A bamboo shoot. I get it.」
Sora
「...Split a bamboo shoot into three equal parts and split it into two trapezoids from the bottom and a triangle at the top. You get this when you connect them.」

％Ｂ
「Hm... That makes things easier to understand.」
Sora
「...Making the sides of the triangles curved lets you make it more spherical when it's put together.」

Sora
「...The curves need to be calculated properly. If you take the height of the base as h, the radius of the dome as r, and the ratio of the circumferences of the pieces as n―」

all
Sora takes out a notebook and starts writing out formulas in it.
It's all trigonometric functions and equations for quadratic curvature.
I'm amazed at how fast she's working her way through the math.
Sora
「...Is how you get the degree of curvature.」
％Ｂ
「...I see.」
All I can do is nod.
Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「...」
And the conversation stops again.
I guess it's my fault for not having a better response...
Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「...」
Sora's staring at me.
I wonder what's going on. It feels like she's expecting something of me...

Sora's seemed nervous ever since she first came over today.

I've been nervous too.
Because the girl in front of me is my "girlfriend."
％Ｂ
「...Sora. Can I come over there?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
She lets a moment pass, as if to think, and then gives a small nod.
I nervously move over so I'm next to her.
I feel like her shoulders tense up a bit as I approach.
I try placing my hand over hers on the floor. She clenches her fist for a moment in surprise, but then I feel her gradually relax.


％Ｂ
「...Sora...」
She turns her face toward me, still bashfully looking away from me.

％Ｂ
「...Sora?」
This time, she looks at me.
Her eyes look embarrassed, and also a little damp.
I bring my face closer to Sora, drawn in by her gaze. Specifically, I bring my lips closer.

Sora tilts her head upward a little and closes her eyes.

$$smh_OpenCHK
I'm seeing Sora off at the bus stop.
％Ｂ
「Hey... Wanna go on a date tomorrow?」
Sora
「...A date?」
％Ｂ
「We won't have time for stuff like that once summer break's started 'cause of the festival preparations, right? So I thought we could do it now.」

Sora
「...*nod*」
Sora
「...Is there somewhere you want to go?」
％Ｂ
「Let's see... I wanna watch the stars with you again. We went to the park last time, so how about the beach this time? Let's watch the stars over the ocean.」


Sora
「...Night only?」
％Ｂ
「No, we'll be together for the day too.」
Sora
「...I'll need a swimsuit then.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. I'd be happy if we could have fun at the beach and just stay there together until it's night.」

Sora
「...*nod*」
Sora
「...I'm looking forward to tomorrow.」
She smiles happily.
all
And so─
Employee
「Welcome!」
I stop by the convenience store after seeing Sora off.
I stand in front of the pharmaceuticals section with my arms crossed, basket in hand.

％Ｂ
「...」
I pretend I'm inspecting various packages of bandages while I glance at the condoms the next shelf over maybe once every five seconds.

I should definitely buy some...
It's good manners... It's etiquette...
But why the hell are there so many different kinds?
Does the quality differ based on the brand?
What's up with that crazy-looking box?
It'd be so embarrassing bringing those up to the register...

％Ｂ
「...」
I see 0.02 mm, 0.03 mm... Aren't they gonna break if they're that thin?



Is that really okay?
I can see cartoon-print ones too... Are the designs printed onto the condoms? Would star-print ones make Sora happy...?

Hm? Strawberry flavored!? Flavor!? They're flavored!?
It looks like there are different sizes too. What size am I?
I've never freakin' compared with other guys or anything.
％Ｂ
「...Maybe I'll call Shuuichi.」
"What's your dick size? Small, medium, or large?"
Yeah freakin' right! I can't ask that! And I don't want to, either!
$$smh_OpenCHK
L-Let's see... It's fine. I'm sure I'm average.
I'm sure of it! Probably!
So I'll buy a normal size... I'll get the medium ones!
And if it's too big... I'll cry...
％Ｂ
（A-All right... I'm gonna buy it!）
I snap the 0.03-mm medium-size condoms off the shelf and throw them in my basket.

I immediately walk away and throw a ton of boxed snacks in my basket.

They're all similarly sized to the box of condoms.
If you're gonna hide a tree, then hide it in a forest!
％Ｂ
「...This should be enough.」
I head toward the register after grabbing enough snacks to cover up the box of condoms.

And─
％Ｂ
「Aagh!」
Employee
「Oh, is something the matter?」
％Ｂ
「N-No... Nothing really...」
Th-This register has one of those screens that show you what you're buying...\n\r

Which means...
Chocolates, snacks, snacks, condoms, snacks...
I can't hide it!
And they're gonna put just the condoms in their own little baggy too...!

That little bit of thoughtfulness is so painful.
％Ｂ
「...Phew...」
I won't be able to come back here for a while...
