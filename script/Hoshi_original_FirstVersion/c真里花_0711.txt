Teacher B
「Okaaay, pencils down! Pass your answer sheets up to the front!」
％Ｂ
「...It's over.」
Final exams are finally over.
I'm filled with a relieved sort of exhaustion.
Rikka
「What's over? Your life?」
％Ｂ
「Exams are over! Like that's gonna be the end of my life!」
％Ｂ
「Just so you know, I did pretty decent.」
Rikka
「Oh really... You did look really focused, come to think of it.」

Natsuki
「Ughhhh. It's over. My life's over.」
Rikka
「...Looks like we do have someone whose life is over.」
％Ｂ
「What, didn't go well?」
Natsuki
「I think my physics might be pretty bad this time... I've managed to at least avoid failing up until now, but...」

％Ｂ
「Oh man, I got lucky for physics. It was all stuff that I did forever ago at my last school.」

Natsuki
「What the heck!? That's not fair, is it!? That's pretty much cheating! Teacher, this guy's a cheater!!」


％Ｂ
「It's not even close to cheating! It's all thanks to the fact I sacrificed my sleep this weekend cramming.」

Natsuki
「Yeah, that's true. You had your nose buried in textbooks during breaks this whole week. It was kinda scary.」


％Ｂ
「Of course I did.」
'Cause I've got something to look forward to after my exams.
I got through my exams just fine, and I don't think I'll fail any of them. Now, Shinozaki and I can...

％Ｂ
「Fufufu...」
Natsuki
「What's with that laugh? It's super gross.」

Rikka
「Maybe it's an omen for snow? I should get going.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, come on. Snow in the middle of summer?」
Natsuki
「A thunderstorm or something, then? I'm gonna go home too.」
all
％Ｂ
「What's with you two?」
Was it really that creepy?
Gotta make sure I don't make a face like that around Shinozaki, then.
I'm gonna be going home together with her again today.
％Ｂ
「Fufufu...」
％Ｂ
「Man, that feels great.」
My foot's lighter.
I stopped by the hospital after exams and finally got the cast taken off.
Marika
「It's great that it's already off～ Still, that took no time at all.」

％Ｂ
「The doctor was surprised too. He said I healed fast 'cause I'm young.」
Marika
「I'm so glad. But no overexerting yourself yet, okay?」

％Ｂ
「I know. I might've gotten the cast off, but I bet my muscles are weaker now after not moving them for so long...」


I was shocked when I saw that the foot that had the cast was noticeably thinner than the other one.\n\r

I guess I did spend almost two whole weeks without moving it at all.
％Ｂ
「Either way, I'll get back to normal slow and steady.」
Marika
「Yeah. Let me know if you need any help, okay?」
％Ｂ
「...Like with baths?」
Marika
「...Y-Yeah. I'll help if you need it, okay?」
％Ｂ
「I'm kidding. I'm fine now.」
Marika
「G-Geez! You're so mean～」
％Ｂ
「My bad, my bad. It's thanks to you it healed this quickly.」

Marika
「Th-That's not true... I didn't do anything much.」

％Ｂ
「Oh, but it is true. You were really helpful, so just let me thank you.」

Marika
「O-Okay... You're very welcome... Ehehe.」
She giggles.
Her smile fills me up with a gentle happiness. I feel completely satisfied.

Marika
「But now we can go have fun without worrying. When do you want to go?」

％Ｂ
「I can't really wait. How about tomorrow?」
Marika
「Oh, that works for me～ I don't have work either. But I wonder if everyone else will be free.」

％Ｂ
「Everyone else? Wait, does that mean...」
I had intended on us going out alone, but Shinozaki seems to think that we're inviting the others along too.

％Ｂ
「Um, hey... You think it could be just the two of us?」
Marika
「Huh? Just the... You mean, you and me...? Wha? But...」

％Ｂ
「Not okay?」
Marika
「N-No, it's okay! I'm totally fine with it... or more like, I'm happy about that...」


％Ｂ
「It's decided, then. Anywhere specific you wanted to go? I can decide otherwise...」

Marika
「Yeah... Well, I was thinking maybe the beach. Tomorrow's actually when they open it up.」

％Ｂ
「Really? That's perfect, then.」
Marika
「Yeah, but... I was thinking the beach because I thought we were all going together... but if it's just you and me, Hino-kun... I-I dunno...」

Marika
「Yeah, but... I was thinking the beach because I thought we were all going together... but if it's just you and me... I-I dunno...」

％Ｂ
「Uh... Is there an issue?」
Marika
「Umm, well, it's just... It's kinda different from when we went to go catch those fish～ ...I don't have any cute swimsuits to wear for something like that...」


Marika
「I wanted to get a new one this year, but...」
％Ｂ
「Then we can just go buy one before we go. I don't have any problems going shopping with you.」

Marika
「Huh!? ...You'll come shopping with me? Oh, okay... Then... I guess it's okay.」

％Ｂ
「All right, let's do it, then! We'll go shopping for a swimsuit tomorrow, and then go to the beach!」

Marika
「Yeah... But... W-Waaah～ ...That's kind of embarrassing～」

％Ｂ
「Oh... You're not forcing yourself, are you? If you don't actually wanna go...」

Marika
「Th-That's not true! I'm really happy!」
％Ｂ
「Then be happy!」
Marika
「Y-Yaaay～ ...I'm so happy...」
She puts on a ridiculously stiff smile.
She seems really nervous.
But it's not like I can take back what I've said at this point.
I'll just have to enjoy tomorrow as much as I can!
