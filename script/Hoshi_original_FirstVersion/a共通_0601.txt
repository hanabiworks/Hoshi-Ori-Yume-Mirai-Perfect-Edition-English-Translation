The following day, I find myself at the marketplace by the train station.
％Ｂ
「I feel like everything's changed.」
The city's a lot more developed than it was seven years ago.
There used to be a lot of older buildings before. It was kind of a stereotypical old-school market.

％Ｂ
「Doing my shopping over here seems convenient.」
％Ｂ
「And I'm looking for... Oh, here it is.」
It's a particularly refined-looking building.
It's not flashy enough to be eye-catching, but it isn't so dull as to be unremarkable either.

The words "Azuma Morio Architectural Firm" are engraved into the entranceway plate.
％Ｂ
「...Phew.」
I exhale to calm my nerves.
Azuma Morio is the architect that represents Shionagi City.
He's the reason I'm interested in architecture. There's no end to how much I respect him.
％Ｂ
「All right... Let's go!」
I take another deep breath, and step in.
％Ｂ
「Excuse me...」
All is still in the office.
The door was unlocked, but no one's here. It's completely empty.

％Ｂ
「I'm ％Ａ... I have an interview here today...」
No response.
I was told to come here Sunday morning after I applied for an interview...
But is it really okay for me to be here?
％Ｂ
「Excuse me? Is there anyone here?」
Maybe they're out doing something?
I feel like leaving the door unlocked is a bit too careless then...
％Ｂ
「...Hm?」
I feel like I heard something.
...Is there someone here after all?
？？？／我妻
「Nnnnghh... Fuaaahhhh... afh...」
Someone yawns and gets up from underneath the desk.

％Ｂ
（I-Isn't that...!?）
There's no mistake!
This is the very person I respect so much―
％Ｂ
「A...Azu―」
Azuma
「...Coffee.」
％Ｂ
「...What?」
Azuma
「...Give me... coffee.」
％Ｂ
「Co...Coffee?」
Azuma
「...Mmm...」
all
Looks like he just woke up. Azuma Morio―I mean, Mr. Azuma―just says that without really looking my way, and then lies back down on the floor.


Azuma
「...Wake me up... once it's done.」
％Ｂ
「Uh... Uh huh.」
...Maybe he's half asleep?
...No, that's not it... This is Mr. Azuma testing me.
It must be some kind of test to see if I have what it takes to work for him.
The interview's already begun...
I'm currently being evaluated!
％Ｂ
「Coffee, you said? I understand.」
The office has a small kitchenette in the back.
I obviously don't know where anything is, but making a cup of coffee shouldn't be that hard!

％Ｂ
「Mr. Azuma... Mr. Azuma.」
Azuma
「Nnh... nnnhh?」
％Ｂ
「I've made some coffee for you.」
Azuma
「...Ohh... Thanks.」
He sits up and brings the cup up to his mouth.
There was only instant coffee, but it doesn't look like he minds how it tastes.
Azuma
「Hot, hot... Fhh, fhh... *sip*...」
％Ｂ
「I've also cleaned up the trash in the kitchen, and washed the dishes in the sink.」
Azuma
「Oh, sorry you had to do that.」
％Ｂ
「Oh no, I thought I might as well.」
Azuma
「...So. Who are you again?」
％Ｂ
「...Excuse me?」
He doesn't know who I...
％Ｂ
「I'm ％Ａ! I'm ％Ａ ％Ｂ! I've come here today to your office for―」

Azuma
「
...Hino? 

I'm not sure I...?」
％Ｂ
「I called to apply for the internship, and they told me to come to this office at this time for an interview...」


Azuma
「...An internship?」
Azuma
「Ohh... Now that you mention it, I kinda remember someone saying something like that... Something about how a student might or might not come for an interview.」

％Ｂ
「Y-Yes, that! I'm that...! I mean, I would be that student.」
Azuma
「Oh, then why didn't you just say so?」
Azuma
「I just thought you were a new hire when I saw you there when I woke up. Sorry for making you do that.」

...So then that wasn't a test or anything just now?
And more importantly... He seems like he isn't the most organized person.
％Ｂ
「Oh... Right.」
I pull out a clear folder and portfolio from my bag.

％Ｂ
「First... Here's my CV.」
He accepts my CV and starts looking through it as he sips on his coffee.

Azuma
「I see... So you used to live here before?」
％Ｂ
「Yes. I lived in Shionagi until about seven years ago. I moved midway through elementary school.」

Azuma
「I see, I see... Hm... Hmmm? Wait, you're kidding, right? You're not a university student?」


％Ｂ
「Uh... Um, no, I'm not.」
all
Internships are usually done by university students to get hands-on professional experience to prepare to enter the workforce.

It's not a system exclusive to university students, of course, but people my age are in the minority by a significant margin.

I don't begrudge Mr. Azuma for being surprised. And I was also expecting that to be the sticking point.

But I can't let myself get discouraged by something like that if I want to work with someone I respect so much.

Azuma
「So you're going to Shionagi First Academy... Oh, man... You're gonna be taking university exams and everything. Why'd you come here?」


％Ｂ
「Because I admire your work greatly, and because my goal in life is to become an architect like you.」

I say it simply and clearly.
％Ｂ
「My family has returned to Shionagi City, and since your architectural firm is located here, I thought I could perhaps take this opportunity to work here and learn from you.」


Azuma
「...Now wait a second. You admire me? Are you serious?」
％Ｂ
「Y-Yes, of course. You're the architect I admire most. I own your book. Your subtle and refined designs are―」

Azuma
「Oh... You saying that makes me happy and all... but it's weird that you think of me that way... Besides, I'm not really the kind of person that gets admirers...」


％Ｂ
「Uh... Yes, I saw as much earlier. It does seem that you indeed have a bit of a disheveled side, but...」

Azuma
「...You're pretty honest.」
％Ｂ
「I-I'm very sorry... But I still would like to learn from you. I don't think I'd lose to anyone in terms of the way I feel about this.」

Azuma
「Mmm... Learn from me, huh...」
He looks a bit conflicted.
This isn't looking great...
Azuma
「I really do understand that you're passionate, and I'm genuinely happy that you admire me so much.」

Azuma
「But you should know that being an architect isn't something that you can pull off with admiration alone.」

％Ｂ
「...Yes, of course. You're correct.」
I already expected him to say something like that.
％Ｂ
「One of my father's friends is an architect. He has an architectural firm near my previous place of residence.」

％Ｂ
「I actually already have experience as an architecture intern. I worked there for a year.」

Azuma
「Hoh... Really now.」
％Ｂ
「This is my letter of recommendation from that firm.」
％Ｂ
「My tasks were mostly miscellaneous affairs, but I also have some legitimate experience. I'm skilled at making models, and the owner said I was better at it than anyone else in the firm.」


Azuma
「Model-making... Hm... Yes, the letter of recommendation mentions it as well.」
％Ｂ
「This is a collection of my work.」
all
I hold out my portfolio to him.
It's filled with photos of the models I created for the architectural firm I interned at previously.

％Ｂ
「These are models with built-in inner lights. There's no need to do this much for a house model, but I had some spare time while making them, so I decided to add them on.」


％Ｂ
「This is a large-scale model for a high-rise apartment complex. This was my first time making a large model, but I think it came out well. The head architect also praised it.」


I explain each of my creations as I flip the pages.
％Ｂ
「I had to make this model on short notice, with only one day before it was to be presented. I stayed up all night and was able to complete the full model. I was told later that it was well liked at the presentation.」


Azuma
「Hm... I see. So you have a decent degree of experience when it comes to model-making.」

％Ｂ
「Y-Yes! In addition to these, I can make cross-sectional-view models, or any other kind of model!」

Azuma
「Any kind of model... I see.」
...I might've said a bit too much.
No. I need to sell myself at least this much.
Azuma
「...Actually, I have a blueprint that got rejected. I quite liked it myself, but maybe I'll have you make a model of that.」


Azuma
「It was a high-rise office building... Let's see, which one was it... Ah, here it is. This one.」

He pulls out a single blueprint from a huge folder.
Azuma
「I can't really judge a person based just on what they say. So I'd like to see your skill in action. Could you make this blueprint into a model right here, right now?」


％Ｂ
「...Right now?」
Azuma
「Is this too sudden?」
Azuma
「I'm not expecting you to be able to finish it within the day, of course. But I'd like to see how far you can get―」

％Ｂ
「I'll do it! I'll finish it today!」
Azuma
「Hoh, today? I understand that you want to impress me, but isn't that a bit much?」

％Ｂ
「No need to worry! I'm used to being on a tight deadline! I'll definitely finish it!」

Azuma
「I see... But you know, if you say you'll do it, then I'll expect you to take responsibility for your words.」

％Ｂ
「Y-Yes. Of course.」
Azuma
「Then let's have you begin. You can use this workbench. Feel free to use any of the supplies.」


％Ｂ
「I understand. Thank you very much.」
all
All right... Looks like I've gotten my foot in the door.
If I can finish this model on time, then he should be pretty impressed.

Luckily, I've made models of high-rise buildings before on several occasions.
Let's start by taking a look at the blueprint―
％Ｂ
「...!?」
Wha...What's with this blueprint!?
I've never seen a blueprint this complex.
I never worked on something this complex back at the old firm...
％Ｂ
（No... I need to calm down.）
No matter how complex it is, it should be doable if I just stick to my fundamentals.
I just need to stay calm and carefully decipher the blueprint.
％Ｂ
「It appears to be an office building design with braced steel frames... Would it be okay if I made a photocopy of this blueprint?」

Azuma
「I don't mind. The copy machine's over there.」
％Ｂ
「Thank you very much.」
I photocopy the blueprint.
I tidy up the workbench and make space for myself.
I prepare the styrene boards and balsa wood that I'm going to use to build the model. I lay out all the tools.

％Ｂ
「All right... Let's start.」
I cut my copy of the blueprint into parts.
I use spray-glue to paste the parts onto the styrene board.

I'm going to use these as guidelines for my cuts.
I start making my cuts once the board dries.
I carefully clean each and every one of the cut pieces, making sure there aren't any burrs or uneven sides.

Building architectural models isn't as easy as just putting things together.
They have to be made exactly and beautifully.
This time, I also need to be fast. It's a difficult situation.
But... I'll just have to pull it off!
Azuma
「Hoh... Looks like you really know what you're doing.」
％Ｂ
「...」
Azuma
「I like your focus. I'll be finishing up some work, so let me know if you need anything.」

Azuma
「...Hm... What? Look at the time...」
％Ｂ
「...」
Azuma
「Hey, it's a bit late, but do you wanna go eat some lunch or something? There's a ramen place nearby. The taste's so-so, but they make up for it in volume.」


％Ｂ
「...」
Azuma
「Heeey. You listening?」
％Ｂ
「I'm very sorry... Please enjoy lunch without me... I can't really step away...」
Azuma
「Hold on, you don't need to go that far, do you? I'm not about making people work so hard they have to skip―」

％Ｂ
「...」
Azuma
「...Well, I guess it's not like I don't see where you're coming from. How many times have you restarted now?」

He's smiling sympathetically, looking at the failed attempts I've placed off to the side.
...And it's not just one or two failed attempts, either.
Azuma
「Looks like it's a pretty difficult construction job. What are you up to now?」
％Ｂ
「...I'm currently recalculating the widths and lengths of each of the braces.」
Azuma
「Hm, I see... So, do you think you're going to be able to finish today at that pace?」
％Ｂ
「...」
The answer's already clear.
I already knew from the third failure onward that it'd be impossible to finish today.

Azuma
「You told me that you'd take responsibility for what you said. Are you gonna stay silent like that when a client asks you that question?」


％Ｂ
「...I'm very sorry.」
％Ｂ
「I... will not be able to finish today.」
Aghh... I've said it.
With this... it's over.
Azuma
「Hm... This your first time making a model of a shell-design building?」
％Ｂ
「...I've made a rigid-frame before... but I don't have any similar experience with a building as large as this.」

Azuma
「I'm surprised you told me that you could do anything if that's the case.」

Azuma
「It looks like you've forgotten to put the horizontal brace in first. You should've realized this right away. Otherwise, there's no way to relieve tension, and it may result in the diagonal braces buckling.」


Azuma
「It'd be disgraceful as an architect if a client pointed that out.」

％Ｂ
「...Gh.」
Azuma
「And as for this centrally placed brace. This is to be a buckling-restrained brace, made from unbonded material. It can't be attached to the main frame.」


％Ｂ
「Oh... I-I see...」
I take another look at the blueprint, at the spot he pointed out.
Ah... It's just like he said...
So it wasn't just the horizontal brace that I neglected...
Azuma
「So what this means is that even if you were to work here, you wouldn't be able to accomplish tasks to a satisfactory degree.」

％Ｂ
「...Yes.」
I want to beg him to reconsider, but I have no way to refute his points...
All I can do is hang my head in frustration.
My work at the previous firm definitely wasn't easy.
It's just that this place is too high-level for me.
Azuma
「Now now. Don't get so down.」
％Ｂ
「Huh?」
Azuma
「It might've been a bit rash of you to try to leap into working here at this firm at your current level of skill. But I don't really hate that about you.」


Azuma
「Everyone's trying to catch up to their dream as fast as they can at your age. You all think that it might not come true if you don't act as soon as possible.」


Azuma
「Nothing wrong with an early start, of course. But it's not like your dream won't come true just because you took the long way there.」


Azuma
「You should already know this if you're a fan of mine. I was a late bloomer as an architect.」

Azuma
「I was already past thirty by the time I opened this firm. Before that, I was working part-time job after part-time job, just wandering around.」


％Ｂ
「Y-Yes... I know about that.」
Azuma
「It's weird saying this myself, but my designs incorporate my experiences from my wandering around back then. I guess you never know what's gonna come in handy.」


Azuma
「What I'm saying is... Uhh... I think what you should do is immerse yourself in what only the present you can do, and what you can only do in the present.」


What only the present me can do?
Azuma
「Schoolwork, extracurriculars, love, anything's fine. What I'm saying is you need to enjoy the golden years of your youth more!」

％Ｂ
「I see...」
Azuma
「Those kinds of experiences will definitely be useful for your future. It won't be too late for you to enter the world of architecture if it's after graduating university.」

％Ｂ
「Mr. Azuma...」
Azuma
「Uhh... Could you stop with that reverent "Mr." stuff? It's just way too embarrassing for me.」

％Ｂ
「I'm sorry...」
Azuma
「Well... Anyway, we were probably meant to meet like this in some way. You should come hang out here at the office every now and then.」

％Ｂ
「Wha... You mean...」
Azuma
「Come clean up or something again. I won't pay you, but I'll at least treat you to some ramen.」

％Ｂ
「Ye...Yes! I will! I will for sure!」
％Ｂ
「Aw, man... So it didn't work out.」
The interview just didn't work out. I won't get to work at the firm of the architect I admire so much.

But I don't feel like this is the end of my dream, either.
In fact, I feel pretty good right now.
％Ｂ
「Go at it without rushing myself, huh?」
I'll do like Mr. Azuma said. I'll do what only the present me can do.\n\r

I can still make my dream come true afterward.
％Ｂ
「Oh... Speaking of which...」
I pull an envelope out from my bag.
Mr. Azuma handed it to me as I was leaving, saying it was for the travel fares back.
％Ｂ
「Even after I told him I didn't need it 'cause I was walking...」
I open the envelope and look inside.
％Ｂ
「Whoa... There's a ton of money in here!?」
This is way too much for travel fare...
He didn't put in money for the time I spent building that model too, did he?
％Ｂ
「Even though all I did was just waste his supplies and cause him trouble...」
I feel a bit guilty.
But it's not like I'm gonna just go return it now...
％Ｂ
「...I guess I might as well just spend it all right now.」
Not like it's money I expected to have anyway.
I kinda feel like I'd feel less guilty about it if I just used it all up instead of keeping it.

％Ｂ
「What to do...」
I look inside my bag. A flyer catches my eye.
％Ｂ
「Oh... It's from yesterday.」
It's the flyer that girl dropped in front of my house.
It's an ad for the Shionagi Park pool.
There are fees and costs for rental swimsuits written on the back.
％Ｂ
「The pool...」
I look up at the sky. The sun's harsh rays glare down at me.
I remember the weather forecast this morning saying that it'd only get hotter by the day.

％Ｂ
「...Guess I'll go swim a bit as a change of pace!」
％Ｂ
「Oh, it's pretty crowded here!」
There are a lot more people than I expected here.
There are kids running around, groups of people around my age, and some couples too.
Everyone looks happy and energetic.
I feel like just being here's doing wonders for whatever disappointment I was feeling.

％Ｂ
「All right! Let's go ride that, to cheer me up!」
I look up at the water slide.
It's way bigger than I expected. It looks like some kind of gigantic Jurassic dinosaur.
％Ｂ
「Whoaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhh!?」
％Ｂ
「That was scarier than I thought...」
It was actually pretty terrifying, even though kids were flying down the slide like it was no big deal.
％Ｂ
「Ahhh～ Still, I'm glad I came～」
I'm floating in the lazy river, holding onto a rental float ring.

I can barely even believe I felt so down earlier.
Tweet, tweet♪ Tweet, tweet♪
％Ｂ
「Oh? What's going on?」
I can hear a cheery whistling sound. It's almost as if it's sharing in my lightened mood.
Sounds like it's from the toddlers pool.
I can hear the voices of tons of excited kids approaching.
Instructor
「No running, everyone!」
There's a woman who's probably an instructor of some sort warning them.
Looks like a swim class is starting up or something.
Boy A
「I dooooon't wannaaaaaa!」
％Ｂ
「Hm?」
And then I hear one of the kids crying and yelling.
Seems like one of them is afraid of the water.
Yeah. There's always one like that.
_00cutinBS
？？？／真里花
「Don't worry, okay? I'll be there with you. There's nothing to be afraid of.」


Boy A
「I'm never going iiiiin!」
_00cutinBS
？？？／真里花
「Now don't be that way. Let's do our best together, okay?」
Looks like a part-timer girl.
She looks about the same age as me. She's trying as hard as she can to persuade the kid, but he's only crying harder.

_00cutinBS
？？？／真里花
「It'll definitely be okay～」
_00cutinBS
％Ｂ
「...Huh?」
I suddenly felt something deep in my chest while I was watching the face of the girl trying to soothe the child.

What was that?
I feel like it's happened before...
_00cutinBS
？？？／真里花
「Oh! Don't run away～!」
_00cutinBS
_00cutinBS
I return to my senses after I hear a desperate yell.
I spot the kid sprinting full speed along the poolside.
That's way more dangerous than the water.
％Ｂ
「Someone's gonna have to catch him quick.」
Fortunately enough, he's running this way.
He hasn't noticed me at all, because he's paying attention to the part-timer girl behind him.

...All right. Now!
％Ｂ
「There! Gotcha!」
I scoop him up and hold him aloft.

Boy A
「Wh-What the heck! Let go of me!」
％Ｂ
「You know it's dangerous to run by the pool, don't you? Here, you need to listen to what she says.」

Boy A
「Shut up! Let go of meee! You kidnapper!」

％Ｂ
「You know some pretty difficult words...」
？？？／真里花
「Um, excuse me... I'm very sorry...!」
That's when the girl finally catches up.
Boy A
「Let go of meee!」
％Ｂ
「Look, she's here too now. No more acting up, okay?」

？？？／真里花
「Th-That's right! It's dangerous, you know!」

The two of us calm the kid down together.
He may be a child, but he's genuinely struggling, so it's pretty difficult.
Boy A
「Waaaaahhh!! I don't wannaaa!!」

％Ｂ
「Guagh!?」
His small fist makes direct contact with my jaw.
？？？／真里花
「Oh! I'm so sorry! Are you okay?」
％Ｂ
「Hahaha... Yeah, I'm fine.」
？？？／真里花
「Auuuh～ What am I going to do?」
Seriously.
It's hard to console kids like this.
What should I do in a situation like this...?
all
％Ｂ
「Oh, I know.」
％Ｂ
「In times like these... You sing!」
Kids stop crying if you sing.
As for what to sing... I know just the thing.
"The Smileman Theme"!
％Ｂ & ？？？
「With our smile puuunch, we can't be beat～♪」
％Ｂ
「...Huh?」
I stop in surprise immediately after starting.
The part-timer girl's frozen in shock too.
We didn't signal to each other to sing, but we ended up doing exactly the same thing.

And we both sang the same obscure song...
％Ｂ
「That song just now...」
？？？／真里花
「Um... It's from an old TV show...」
％Ｂ
「"Smileman," right? I'm surprised you've seen it.」

"Smileman" is an anime that aired back when I was a kid.
I'm real surprised she knows about it, considering how obscure it was.
％Ｂ
「...Huh?」
all
It's that feeling in my chest again.
I think I'm on the edge of remembering something.
My revelation comes in the form of a girl's face.
％Ｂ
「Wha...?」
The face superimposes itself over the part-timer girl's.
I can definitely see the resemblance.
％Ｂ
「Wait, are you...」
？？？／真里花
「Are you...
 Hino-kun?
?
」
She knows my name.

Which means she must be...
％Ｂ
「Shinozaki? From class 4-2 at Aobadai Elementary?」
Her expression changes to a nostalgic smile.
I remember that smile, too.
I knew it, it's Shinozaki... Shinozaki Marika.
Marika
「It's been a while... Actually, I'm surprised we met somewhere like this...」


％Ｂ
「Yeah, seriously. I can't believe we ran into each other in a place like...」

Boy A
「Run!!」
％Ｂ
「Ack! Hey! Get back here!」

Marika
「Waaaaaaaait～～～～～～～～～」
all
％Ｂ
「Hahh, I'm tired. How do kids have so much energy?」

Marika
「Hehe... 
You were just as energetic back when we were kids, Hino-kun.」
You were just as energetic back when we were kids.」

She looks at me happily.
The way she looks at me
, and that way she calls me "Hino-kun," 
 
makes me feel a bit ticklish.
％Ｂ
「You look like you're doing pretty well too. Is your asthma under control now?」

Yeah. The Shinozaki that I knew back in elementary school was overwhelmingly frail.\n\r

Going to a pool would've been unthinkable.
Marika
「Yeah. It got better and better as I got older. I'm completely fine now.」

％Ｂ
「Really now... That's great.」

I express genuine happiness for her as I look over her healthy-looking swimsuit-clad form.\n\r

She's really grown up healthy...
Marika
「Umm～... I-Is there something... on your mind?」
％Ｂ
「Oh... My bad. I didn't mean to...」

Shinozaki's face goes red.
I hadn't even realized where I was looking.
％Ｂ
「I'm glad that you've gotten better. I can't believe that Shinozaki's working at the pool now.」

Marika
「Y-Yeah. I used to take swim classes here... and that's how I ended up working here. They don't have lots of people working here, so...」

It may be a part-time job, but I'm sure you still have to be a good swimmer to work here.
Which means that Shinozaki must be able to swim well enough to do so.
％Ｂ
「Really. That's amazing.」
Marika
「It's not that big a deal... I like kids too... so...」

She's mumbling bashfully.
She's just as quiet as she was back then.
％Ｂ
「Seriously though, I was surprised. I can't believe I'd run into you by coincidence in a place like this.」

％Ｂ
「...Hm?」
all
The word "coincidence" feels weird to me.
Wait a second. Why am I even here again?
Now that I think about it, that flyer was...
％Ｂ
「...Shinozaki. Did you come by my place yesterday?」
I remember the girl who dropped that flyer.
I'm pretty sure she looked similar to Shinozaki.
Marika
「Uh, ummm... I might've...」
％Ｂ
「The heck's that mean?」
Marika
「...Yeah. I did.」
Marika
「I heard from my mom that you might've come back already. So I thought I'd at least say hi before you transferred into our school...」


％Ｂ
「There wasn't any need to run away then, was there?」
Marika
「Sorry... That was really suspicious of me, wasn't it?」

％Ｂ
「And you didn't need to be so on edge either.」
Marika
「Y-Yeah, you're right... Sorry. But I got all nervous because I hadn't seen you in so long...」

Marika
「I was thinking about what I should talk about if I saw you, or maybe you wouldn't recognize me because it's been so long, or maybe you might've just forgotten about me...」


Marika
「I got more worried the more I thought about things, which got me more nervous, and then you suddenly called out to me, so... I just had no idea what I should do.」


％Ｂ
「You're such a worrywart, Shinozaki. How would I forget you? We send each other new year's and summer greeting cards every year and stuff.」


Marika
「But it's been so long since we've actually met. You probably don't care about how I look, so I thought you might've forgot. And I'm... a bit different from back then, too.」


％Ｂ
「Nah, that's not true. I recognized you as soon as I got a good look at your face.」

Marika
「You did? Really?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. You haven't changed as much as you think. You're definitely still recognizable. I bet I would've recognized you yesterday too, if I got to see your face properly.」


Marika
「Whaaat～ I dunnooo.」
％Ｂ
「Seriously. Though it looks like you've gotten so much healthier now that it's still a possibility I'd make a mistake.」

She really does look healthy, to the point where I find it hard to compare her with the way she used to be.

％Ｂ
「Good for you.」
Marika
「Y-Yeah. Thanks... I'm sure it was thanks to you

, Hino-kun

.」
％Ｂ
「Huh? Thanks to me? What's that mean?」

Marika
「Oh, um... Well...」
Instructor
「Shinozaki-san, your break's just about over～」
The instructor calls for Shinozaki.
Marika
「Sorry. I have to get back to work.」
Looks like her break's over.
I wish we could talk more.
％Ｂ
「When are you gonna be done with work?」
Marika
「It'll be in the evening... but there's still about three hours...」

％Ｂ
「Three hours, huh...」
What should I do...?
Go home.
Wait for her.
I guess Shinozaki's working today.
We'll be able to talk as much as we want from now on, since we'll be going to the same school.
And while I'm thinking that...
Marika
「U-Um... Do you want to come over for dinner, if you have the time? Um, uh, my mom mentioned something like that... That I should ask you to come eat if I saw you...」


％Ｂ
「Your mom did?」
I've met Shinozaki's mom a few times before.
I haven't seen her in a while. That'd be nice.
Marika
「Is it okay if I contact you tonight, if it's not a bother?」
％Ｂ
「Actually, I'll just wait until you're done working, then. I'll be by the front entrance.」

Marika
「Okay! I'll see you there!」
She flashes a radiant smile and returns to the pool.
all
...She really did get better.
％Ｂ
「I'll just hang around, since there are pools that I haven't been to yet. I can kill time forever here.」

Marika
「You sure? I'd be happy if you did, but...」

％Ｂ
「It's totally fine. I wanna talk with you some more, since it's been so long.」

Marika
「...Yeah, me too. Okay then. I'm sorry to make you wait, but I'll try to be out as soon as I'm done.」


％Ｂ
「Let's meet at the front entrance around when you get out, then.」
Marika
「Okay! I'll see you there!」
She smiles happily and returns to work.
all
She really did get better.
$$smh_OpenCHK
Shinozaki showed up at the meeting spot right on time.
She must've really rushed out. She was breathing heavily.
The two of us started walking, side by side.
Marika
「I'm so jealous of your new house... I'm sure it's really clean.」

％Ｂ
「Well yeah, because it's new. It's not perfect at all, though. We don't have hot water yet.」


Marika
「What? Really? How do you take baths, then?」

％Ｂ
「I had to take a cold shower yesterday. Thank god it's summer.」

Marika
「Whaaat～ I feel so sorry for you. It might be summer, but I bet it doesn't really feel like you washed off if it wasn't a hot bath.」

％Ｂ
「I'll just have to make do. I only need to wash my sweat away anyway.」
Marika
「I'm trying to remember if there are any bathhouses nearby... Just a second. I'll try asking my mom.」

all
Shinozaki starts tapping at her smartphone.
She apparently gets a response right away.
Marika
「Wha... O-Oh come on, Mom...」
For some reason, Shinozaki's face is red.
％Ｂ
「What's wrong? I guess there aren't any bathhouses nearby after all?」

Marika
「Huh? Oh, well, I'm not really sure...」

％Ｂ
「You're not sure? You mean like, your mom doesn't know?」

Marika
「No, that's not what I meant... My mom said, um... that I should just bring you over.」


％Ｂ
「Over? To your place?」
Marika
「Y-Yeah... She says she's making dinner right now, so you should just come eat. And she said you should... use our bath, too...」


％Ｂ
「Huh? Use your bath?」
So she's saying I should go to the house of a girl my age and use her bath...
％Ｂ
「Uh... I don't really know about that. You wouldn't just want someone who isn't family like me to use your bath, would you?」


Marika
「Uh, ummm... Mmm... I don't really think it's a problem...」

％Ｂ
「Y-You don't?」
Marika
「I wouldn't if it were someone I didn't know, but it's... not like that's the case...」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, but still...」
Marika
「I-If you'd like, I'd... like it if you came too... B-Because you know, you should take a proper bath today. It'll help you relax too...」


％Ｂ
「Well that's... yeah, you're right. If you say it's okay, then... Okay, I guess I'll take you up on the offer.」

Marika
「Y-Yeah, I'd like it if you would～ I'll tell my mom you're coming, then!」

all
Her voice bounces with happiness. She starts typing up another mail.
Shinozaki's house...
I'm glad I'll get to take a bath, but things have gotten a bit weird.

Marika
「It's here.」
A nostalgic building appears after a while of walking.
％Ｂ
「Yeah, I remember this place. I guess this hasn't changed.」

I've been to Shinozaki's house a lot before.
It's seriously been a long time, but time winds back once I'm actually here. My memories return.

Marika
「No need to hesitate, come in...」
％Ｂ
「Excuse me, then.」
％Ｂ
「...」
Marika
「...」
all
It's a very quiet dinner.
Shinozaki's family... isn't a very proper and refined one, so that's not the reason why.
It's because of this rather unique tension in the air.
The tension coming from...
？？？／浩二
「...」
This person.
Shinozaki's dad. Shinozaki Kouji.
He was apparently supposed to come home late today, but he ended up coming home earlier than expected and so here we are.

Shinozaki and I are just childhood friends.
We haven't seen each other in forever, and there's nothing scandalous going on, but it's vaguely, incredibly awkward.

Kouji
「...」
％Ｂ
「...」
Marika
（Sorry about this. I didn't think my dad would be here...）

Shinozaki apologizes from her seat next to mine.
％Ｂ
（You don't need to apologize. This isn't any kind of a problem. I'm just here to eat anyway.）


all
Yeah. That's right.
It's not like I've come here to announce that the two of us are dating, or ask him for his daughter's hand in marriage.

I'm just here to eat dinner at a friend's house.
Might be a bit brazen of me considering it's been so long since we've seen each other, but it's still just that.
I can just keep my head high and continue on, since there's nothing I have to be guilty about.
％Ｂ
（There's nothing I have to hide, so I'll just enjoy the food.）
Marika
（Yeah, that's true. And after you eat you can take a bath...）

Kouji
「Hey.」
all
A low, hostile voice sounds out.
I almost choke on the rice in my mouth.
Kouji
「What are you two whispering about over there? If you've got something to say, you should say it out loud so we all can hear.」

He says that while looking at Shinozaki.
But I can tell that those words were directed at me as well.

Marika
「It's nothing, Dad. Besides, you should hurry up and eat. You seem like you're eating awfully slowly today.」


Huh.
I guess Shinozaki's pretty up front about saying things to her dad.\n\r
I think this might be the first time I've ever seen her so strong-willed.
So this is what she's like at home.
If anything, the thought makes me want to smile. She must've gotten lots of love growing up.
Kouji
「Wh-What are you talking like that for? Is it not okay for me to eat slowly? Whose house do you think this is?」


Marika
「It's yours, Mom's, and also mine.」
Marika
「We have a guest today! How's he supposed to feel at ease eating when you're being so crabby?」


％Ｂ
「Huh? N-No, I'm not really...」
I feel like putting it that way might just make things worse...
Kouji
「Hnmh...」
But it seems that Shinozaki's ranked higher than her father in this household.\n\r

Guess he's the type who can't say no to his beloved daughter.
all
？？？／由美
「Oh my, what are you arguing about? I'd like it if you enjoyed my food, since it came out so nicely.」


A woman joins the conversation, pretty much radiating a comfortable aura. It's Shinozaki's mom, Yumi-san.

Yumi
「You know, the way food's cooked is important, but the mood at the table or the conversation can change its flavor too. It won't taste good if we just ate in grim silence.」


Kouji
「I know that.」
Yumi
「I know you don't, because you're still making that face. Come on, smile!」

Yumi-san grabs her husband's face with both hands and tugs forcefully to either side.

Kouji
「Shtop thah.」
Yumi
「There we go. Keep your face like that. 
Ryousuke-kun, you 
You 
should have fun eating too.」
％Ｂ
「Y-Yes, I will.」
Kouji
「Hmph... Get me a beer.」
Yumi
「Aren't we drinking a lot today?」
Shinozaki's dad gulps down his beer as if he's trying to escape.
I guess he must be really wary of me.\n\r
I wish he'd understand that there really isn't anything like that going on.
Yumi
「
Ryousuke-kun, the 
The 
bath's ready, so go on ahead～」
％Ｂ
「Uh, but...」
I can't help but look at Shinozaki's dad.
He's currently still drinking beer while watching TV.

％Ｂ
「Hey, Shinozaki... It's probably not good for me to go in before your dad, right?」
Marika
「You don't need to worry about that. Dad's still drinking.」

Kouji
「...Phaaah.」
Looks like he's pretty drunk.
If that's the case, then I guess I'll go in first.
Marika
「Here you go then. Your bath towel.」
The towel's soft and fluffy.
Ours aren't this soft.
I guess you even notice the little differences between households.
And...
Marika
「It's kind of...」
She mumbles something, and then turns red and says nothing more.
I hurriedly reposition the towel in my hands. I can kind of guess at what the rest of her sentence was.

％Ｂ
「I'll go take that bath now, then.」
Marika
「O-Okay. Take your time.」
『It's like we're newlyweds.』
Shinozaki was probably about to say something along those lines.
I felt the same way.
％Ｂ
「Ahhh. You gotta take baths if you're Japanese.」
It's revitalizing.
I feel like the hot water's seeping into my very soul.
％Ｂ
「Still, feels weird.」
I'm taking a bath at someone else's house. And it's Shinozaki's house, when I met her for the first time in forever only just earlier today.

Now that I've thought about it, I'm a bit nervous.
％Ｂ
「Hm?」
Did someone just enter the changing room?
％Ｂ
「What if it's Shinozaki... Yeah, right.」
Ending up in the bath with your childhood friend's the kinda thing that only happens in manga or games.\n\r

She knows that I'm in here right now anyway.
％Ｂ
「...So who is it, then?」
Kouji
「Hey. I'm coming in.」
％Ｂ
「Wha?」
This voice is...
Shinozaki's dad?
Kouji
「Hm...」
％Ｂ
「Wh-Wha, why...? I thought you were going to be drinking and watching TV...」

Kouji
「What are you making that face for? It's fine, we're both men.」

％Ｂ
「Uh, no, that's totally fine, but...」
Kouji
「I'm sure you're at least fine taking baths together with your father.」
％Ｂ
「U-Uh huh...」
Kouji
「Uh, b-but that doesn't mean that I want you to think of me as your father, all right!?」

％Ｂ
「What? No, I don't really think of you like...」
What on earth is he here for?
I have absolutely no idea what he could possibly want.
But it looks like I shouldn't be the only one in the bath.
％Ｂ
「I-I'll wash your back for you!」
I hurriedly get out of the bath and grab a sponge.
Kouji
「There's no need to do that, you know. You can just lie back and relax in the tub.」

％Ｂ
「N-No... I'll do it...」

Kouji
「Well, I'll take you up on your offer if you insist.」
I circle around behind him.
Things have gotten kinda strange.
I didn't think he was that big a guy, but his shoulders are unexpectedly broad.\n\r

There's a distinct tanline at the base of his neck.
Kouji
「Put some force into it now. It won't feel like you're washing me if you just pet at me.」

％Ｂ
「Uh, okay. I'll be forceful, then.」
％Ｂ
「...Hmph!」
Kouji
「Guoh!?」
％Ｂ
「Oh, I'm sorry! Was that too strong?」

Kouji
「Th-That was nothing! I wouldn't mind if you did it even stronger, even. Ughh...」


％Ｂ
「If you say so...! Hmph...!」
Kouji
「Guooohhh...!?」
Kouji
「A-Anyway... 
Hino-kun, was it? 

What's your relationship with Marika?」
％Ｂ
「Our relationship? We're friends...」

Kouji
「Just friends?」
％Ｂ
「...Yes.」
What else am I supposed to say? It's the truth.
But I can tell that he isn't convinced.

Kouji
「You say you're just friends, but would someone who's just a friend suddenly show up at her house to eat dinner and even take a bath?」

％Ｂ
「Well, that's... I'm sorry for intruding like this. I actually just moved here... and we currently don't have hot water due to a mishap.」


％Ｂ
「And when I told Shinoza... Marika-san about it, she told me that I could use your bath.」

Kouji
「Hoh, is that so. So what you're saying is that Marika couldn't just not help you, who is "just a friend" to her, in your time of need. Do I have that straight?」


％Ｂ
「Uh... Well, I think that's the case.」

Kouji
「I see, I see! Marika's a kind girl, after all. I could see how she couldn't just ignore your plight.」


Kouji
「But, you shouldn't mistake her good will as her having some kind of special feelings for you now.」

％Ｂ
「Special feelings?」
Kouji
「That's right. No special feelings involved. It's like, well, it's like how she might bring a kitten home without thinking after seeing it abandoned in the rain.」


％Ｂ
「Uh huh. A kitten.」
Kouji
「Right, a kitten! You're a pitiful little kitten! So you should make sure you don't mistake sympathy for affection!」


％Ｂ
「I... I understand.」
His back is telling me I don't really have any other option than to agree.
Though I already know Shinozaki's nice. He doesn't need to tell me.
％Ｂ
「Um...」
Kouji
「What is it? You got something you want to say?」

％Ｂ
「Oh, no. I'm done washing your back... Should I wash the front too?」


Kouji
「Th-There's no need for the front, no! All that matters is you understand. I'll be getting out now.」


He splashes water over himself and swiftly leaves the bathroom.\n\r

What a storm of an encounter.
％Ｂ
「...What was that supposed to be about?」
Either way, I'm tired.
I think I'll relax in the tub for a bit longer.
Marika
「Huh? Are you guys done with the bath already?」

Kouji
「Yeah. I'm good after saying what needed to be said.」
Marika
「What needed to be said? I don't really know what you're talking about, but I wish you wouldn't walk around in your underwear.」

I can hear Shinozaki talking with her dad. Sounds like she ran into him just as he was leaving the changing room.

％Ｂ
「What needed to be said, huh.」
He must've been relieved to know that I'm just a friend.
I guess you just worry about your daughter like that when you're a father.\n\r
Not that I'd know. I'm the single son of the family, with a laissez-faire upbringing.
Marika
「Huh? 
Where'd Hino-kun 
Where'd he 
go?」
Kouji
「Who cares about him. Forget about him.」

Marika
「Forget about... You're drunk, aren't you? It's dangerous to take baths when you're drunk.」


Kouji
「Quiet, I'm fine. I'm fine because I'm the backbone of this family!」

Marika
「That doesn't make any sense.」
Kouji
「Just go take a bath. And forget about that guy.」

Marika
「Geez, you drank way too much, Dad. Either way, he's out of the bath then? Then make sure he doesn't leave so I can see him off, okay?」


Kouji
「I told you to forget about him...」
Marika
「Just hurry up and put on your clothes over there!」
Kouji
「H-Hey, there's no need to be so cold...」
I can hear her dad's voice get farther away.
Looks like she chased him off.
Marika
「Honestly, Dad. I wonder what he told him... I hope it wasn't anything weird...」


Huh. Looks like Shinozaki's back.
Right, I remember her dad told her to hurry up and take a bath...
Hm? Someone's in the changing room?
...Wait. No way, right?
Marika
「Need to be quick! Hurry hurry!」
I-Is that really Shinozaki?
She says she needs to be quick...
As in, take a quick bath?
％Ｂ
「Wait, th-this isn't good.」
I turn away from the door.
I can hear someone enter the bathroom, then immediately freeze up.

Marika
「...What? Whaaaat～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～!?」

％Ｂ
「Wait, Shinozaki, don't yell! What if your dad hears!?」

Marika
「Oh...! S-Sorry! But why are you still...?」

％Ｂ
「I've been here the whole time. Your dad got out alone.」

Marika
「R-Really? But my dad told me to hurry up and take a bath... H-He drank way too much～～!」


％Ｂ
「You can get angry at him later. For now, you should get out. Or maybe I should?」


Marika
「N-No, I will. D-Don't look, okay?」

％Ｂ
「Of course I won't...」
Kouji
「Hey, Marika!」
％Ｂ
「Ack!?」
Her dad's back?
Kouji
「I'm coming in for a bit!」
Marika
「J-Just a second! Uh, um, don't look, okay?」

％Ｂ
「Wha...?」
all
I hear some hurried footsteps behind me, and then Shinozaki steps into the bathtub.

％Ｂ
「H-Hey? Shinozaki...!」
Marika
「I said, don't look! I'd like it... if you looked away...?」

％Ｂ
「I-I know, but...」
I know, and it's not like I'm gonna just stare at her.
I can feel Shinozaki's soft, smooth skin against mine.
Kouji
「...I'm just going to brush my teeth.」
Looks like her dad's started brushing his teeth in the changing room.
Marika
「Y-You can do that after I get out!」
Kouji
「I need to do it now, or else I might fall asleep. Mmm, I drank a bit too much.」

Marika
「I told you so. It's not good to fall asleep drunk, you know.」

Kouji
「No need to worry. I come from a long line of strong-livered men. Uegh, kaff kaff kaff!」


Marika
「Look, you're doing it again. You need to relax more when you brush.」

Kouji
「I know that.」
Marika
「I'm telling you that because I know you don't, you know.」
This is kinda nice.
Shinozaki's a bit harsh on him, but she's still worried for her dad's sake.

Kouji
「...So there really isn't anything between you and that kid?」
He asks timidly through his brushing.
I can feel Shinozaki's back go tense.
Marika
「Y-You heard from Mom, didn't you? He was a classmate of mine back in elementary school.」

Kouji
「I know that. But if he's just a classmate you haven't seen in a while, well... Aren't you two a bit too close?」


Marika
「Huh? Y-You think so～?」
Kouji
「Besides, this is the first time you've brought a boy over.」

Marika
「I-Is it? B-But he... came over back in elementary school too, so...」

Kouji
「Right, it's only ever been him, hasn't it? I'm asking why he's the only one that's special. I mean... it really does seem like you have special feelings toward him...」


Marika
「Wh-What are you saying, Dad～?」
Marika
「
Hino-kun 
He 
always delivered printouts and notes to me when I couldn't go to class back in elementary school.」

Kouji
「And what I'm saying is he was doing that because he had other motives...」
Marika
「Geez, no he didn't! 
Hino-kun's 
He's 
nice to everyone... That's the only reason why.」

Marika
「So don't get weird ideas. It's rude to 
Hino-kun 
him 
too～」
Kouji
「...Hm? Speaking of which, where'd he go, anyway? I remember he was taking a bath with me...」


Oh crap...
Is he about to remember that I didn't leave the bath?
Marika
「Th-That's not important! If you're done, then hurry and leave! I want to get out!」

Kouji
「I-I'm almost done! Just a second... Okay, I'm leaving.」


Her dad hurriedly rinses out his mouth and finally leaves.
The two of us sigh in relief.
And then my heart starts beating like crazy again once I realize that it's just us two again.

Marika
「I-I'll get out first, then!」
％Ｂ
「Huh? No, I should be the one to...」
Marika
「D-Don't look this way!」
％Ｂ
「Oh, m-my bad! But you only just got in, right? I've been in for long enough, so...」


Marika
「No, I'll take a proper bath later anyway. You can just relax here.」

％Ｂ
「You sure? Then I guess I'll stay a bit longer...」

Marika
「Y-Yeah. I'll make sure my dad's not suspicious. I'm pretty sure he's about to sleep anyway...」


％Ｂ
「I hope so.」
Shinozaki gets out of the tub.
I feel weirdly lonely now.
Even though we were only in the tub together for a few minutes.
Marika
「Take your time, then～」
$$smh_OpenCHK
I step outside. It's already completely dark out.
I feel like I might've stayed for a really long time.
Marika
「Sorry things were so hectic. You probably didn't get to relax that much...」

％Ｂ
「No, it was great to just get to take a bath. I'm really grateful. Thanks.」

Marika
「No, it's nothing. You can come take a bath again, if you want... When my dad isn't here.」


％Ｂ
「Ahahah, but that'd be kinda weird too. It'd feel like I'm doing something wrong if I had to hide, you know?」

Marika
「Mmm, that's true... You're really honest
, Hino-kun. 
. 
It's like you never really hide anything...」

％Ｂ
「It's not really something that noble-sounding.」
Marika
「No, you were always that way～」
She seems happy for some reason.
It tickles a bit to see her make a face like that when she talks about me.
Marika
「Oh, umm... Do you know how to get to school and stuff?」

％Ｂ
「Pretty much. I just go straight up along the highway, right?」

Marika
「I think that's the long way～ Want to go to school together tomorrow? I'll show you a shortcut.」

％Ｂ
「That's fine by me, but are you sure? It'll end up making your route longer, won't it?」

Marika
「No, it's totally fine～ I'll see you tomorrow, then.」

％Ｂ
「Okay. See you tomorrow.」
all
We exchange mail addresses... and phone numbers, just in case.
The two of us wave goodbye, and I start to walk away.
Marika
「Oh. Wait.」
But then she stops me.
I look back at her curiously.
Shinozaki's smile lights up the darkness around us.
Marika
「Welcome home.」
Those simple words resound solidly in my chest.
％Ｂ
「...Yeah. I'm home.」
The honest words naturally come to my lips.
％Ｂ
「I'm glad I got to see you again, Shinozaki.」
Marika
「...Yeah. Me too. I'm happy I got to see you again
, Hino-kun. 
. 
I'm... really happy.」

It's dark, but I can still tell that she's red.
She's completely healthy now, but she's still just as shy about things as before.

The thought really drives the fact home that I've come back to this town.
