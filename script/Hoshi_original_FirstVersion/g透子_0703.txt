【Natsuki】「Where the heck are you? #NClass started already.」
％Ｂ
「!? Crap, we're crazy late!」
％Ｂ
「Touko, wake up! We're late!」
Touko
「Mmm... mm...? Oh, morniiing... Ehehe.」
％Ｂ
「We don't have time for that! We're late for class!」

Touko
「Oh dear... I guess we can't do anything about that, can we? We'd just get yelled at if we went back now, and explaining ourselves would be a pain. Let's just relax until it's time for our next class.」


％Ｂ
「...Uh huh.」
Touko
「Anyway then... Good night agaaain...」
％Ｂ
「Agh, hey! ...God, she's so easygoing.」
A lot's changed since I first moved back here... but a lot of it's been because of my relationship with Touko.

Especially inside me.
I've started to see two sides to everything.
This might be a bit of an exaggeration, but it's because I can accept new things through Touko as a lens.

Different ways of thinking, experiences, emotions... Things I never would've been able to have by myself.
Being together like this is very precious to me.
％Ｂ
「I guess I should let Segawa know.」
【％Ｂ】「Touko's asleep and I #Ncan't move.」
【Natsuki】「The heck are you doing.」
【％Ｂ】「Sorry. Cover for me.」
【Natsuki】「I gotcha with the #Nperfect story.」
【Natsuki】「"％Ａ said he felt #Nnauseous. #NMight be morning #Nsickness."」
【Natsuki】「"％Ａ said he felt #Nnauseous. #NMight be morning #Nsickness."」
【Natsuki】_st_0204
...Perfect, my ass.
All she has to do is say I'm not feeling well. No details necessary.
Touko
「Zzz... Zzz...」
％Ｂ
「Now then, let's see... This is the second time I'm skipping class now. It's your fault, you know.」

Touko
「...It's not good to blame others, you know.」
％Ｂ
「Agh, you're awake!」
Touko
「I can't sleep because you're moving around.」
％Ｂ
「Well get used to it... It tickles for me 'cause you move around too, you know.」

Touko
「Ahaha, really? I guess we're even, then.」
A completely good-natured, comfortable atmosphere.
I start feeling just as relaxed as the mood.
I feel like this a lot when I'm with Touko... I like these calm, pleasant moments that are now a part of my life.

Touko
「Mmh... chu...!」
％Ｂ
「Uhih!? T-Touko! Wait a second! Don't!」

Touko
「Mmhhh... Why don't you like it?」
％Ｂ
「Someone's seriously gonna point it out if I skip class and come back with a hickey!」

Touko
「I won't leave any marks, then. Just a biiit.」
％Ｂ
「Aagh!? N-No! I won't be able to hold myself back!」

Touko
「Mm, like how?」
％Ｂ
「Hgh... Uh, in a lot of ways.」
Touko
「Mmm... I don't really think you need to hold yourself back. I don't want to hold myself back either.」

％Ｂ
「What?」
Touko
「If you're holding yourself back, then that'd make me think I need to do the same, right?」




Touko
「I don't wanna think boring things like that. So... Chu.」

％Ｂ
「Hgh...! No, there's a time and place for this, and...!」
Touko
「Geez, fine... I'll try to consider only messing with you at the right time and place from now on, then.」

...What the heck's the right time and place for that?
And if anything, I wish she'd consider the male psychology a bit more in general.

Touko
「I like your face when you're unsure of what you should do
, Ryousuke-kun

.」
Touko
「Maybe that's why I want to mess with you so much.」

％Ｂ
「I like seeing you like that too, you know. And your face when you blush and when you're pouting a bit too.」


Touko
「...It's embarrassing when you say it out loud like that.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, there. That's the face.」
Touko
「No, don't look so much...! It's embarrassing...!」
％Ｂ
「It's the same thing as when you mess with me. I wanna see that reaction.」

Touko
「Geez... You're mean. I didn't think you were this kinda person.」
％Ｂ
「I'm only like this when I'm with you. I dunno, it's just fun.」

Touko
「...Mm. I don't hate being bullied either. I guess we're both the same.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, let's say we are.」
Touko
「Ahaha, okay. It makes my heart beat fast, but it's calming... and feels good.」

It's exciting, but it also puts me at ease, and it's comfortable.
I want to stay like this forever.
Let's stay like this until we find a good stopping point.
The two of us happily enjoy a relaxing afternoon together.

％Ｂ
「...Please excuse me.」
I was told to go to the faculty office after getting back to the classroom.
They apparently took issue with the fact I skipped class.
I don't really mind being lectured.
It's my own fault, so it's to be expected.
What I didn't like was that they said Touko was a bad influence on me.

Touko's apparently just disappeared a few times already in the past.
And the teachers have noticed that I've been with her a lot recently.

％Ｂ
「I can't really yell back at them... 'cause it's not like we're not at fault.」

There's no getting around the fact that we actually skipped class.
They apparently marked both of us down as being sick, but that probably won't happen a second time.

I got off with just a warning... but I wonder how it went for Touko.
Touko
「Sigh... It's finally over. I'm so tired. They always say the same thing.」

％Ｂ
「...You didn't get yelled at a lot, did you?」
Touko
「Mmm... I did. I don't really mind what they say. But more importantly... I think I might be in a bit of trouble.」

％Ｂ
「Hm? With what?」
Touko
「I forgot exams are soon. Aw, man. I might end up completely bombing them at this rate.」

I can't afford to fail my first exams at this school after only having been here for a little over a month.\n\r

Which means I should be worried too...
Touko
「Oh, did you hear? You're apparently not allowed to do any club or committee stuff if you fail any exams.」

％Ｂ
「What!? Seriously!?」
Touko
「I guess Four-Eyes-kun would have lots of complaints if we failed.」
Natsuki
「Oh, there you are! Was everything okay for you two!?」
％Ｂ
「Y-Yeah. We just got lectured a bit. We'll be careful not to skip anymore.」

Natsuki
「Thank god... I get that you two are happy and all, but do things in moderation, okay?」

％Ｂ
「We've got bigger problems than that now! Are you preparing for exams!?」

Natsuki
「What? Do you really think I'd do anything like that?」
Touko
「Mmm... I can't imagine it at all. It'd be kinda funny if you were studying seriously.」


Natsuki
「Touko... You don't have to say it that bluntly, do you...?」
％Ｂ
「We don't have the time for this! I haven't studied much at all!」

Natsuki
「...Okay. Leave it to me. It's the beauty of friendship that saves the day in times like these!」

all
％Ｂ
「...So please help us!」
Touko, Segawa, and I all lower our heads.
Shinozaki and Narusawa watch us with troubled expressions.
Marika
「U-Um... What should we do, Narusawa-san?」
Rikka
「How should I know...? I've never taught anyone before, so I don't know what I would do...」

Natsuki
「You could just teach us how to solve the stuff we don't know, Rikka! C'mon, please! I won't be able to take photos anymore at this rate!」


％Ｂ
「I'm not looking so good either! I had event committee work, and I think the curriculum here's kinda different from my old school's, so...!」


Touko
「I don't really care either way. But three people's the same as two for something like this, isn't it?」

Rikka
「What do you have problems with, by the way?」
％Ｂ
「I'm kinda iffy on the humanities. Especially classical lit and English.」
all
Natsuki
「Pretty much everything! I'm not proud of it, but I don't have any subjects I'm confident for!」


Touko
「Oh, me too. I think I could get something around the average if it were one of those fill-in-the-bubble sheets.」

Marika
「...I don't think we'll be able to do this with just the two of us.」
all
Rikka
「I'm starting to feel the same way... If we had maybe one more person who could help...」

Touko
「Mmm... What about Jellyfish-senpai? Fluffyhead can't help us since she's a first year, but maybe Jellyfish-senpai could teach us as an upperclassman?」

all
Natsuki
「That's it! You're so smart, Touko! I'm pretty sure Misa-san has top-level grades for her year!」

Segawa immediately pulls out her phone and contacts her.\n \n\r

It really feels like we're pulling out all of the stops to try to avoid failing.
all
Rikka
「I thought you were a good student, Hino-kun... What a shame.」
Rikka
「I thought you were a good student... What a shame.」
％Ｂ
「I'm begging you, don't look so genuinely disappointed! I just happened to transfer in, and I had committee work, so...!」

Touko
「Ah, that's not fair! You should admit that you were playing lots too
, Ryousuke-kun

!」

all
Natsuki
「It's because you were flirting around with Touko, riiight? I bet you're all set for health class.」

％Ｂ
「Sh-Shut up! Just so you know, I'm totally set for math and science! I'd do just fine even if I took the exams right now!」


Natsuki
「Whaaat!? Wait a second, is Touko the only one who's in the same camp as me here!?」

Touko
「Ahaha, because I'm almost always asleep in class. I'm not proud, but I'm not sure I even know what's going to be on the exams.」

Natsuki
「I win! I know what's going to be on them! Looks like I'm in the lead by one point!」

Rikka
「...You're competing at too low a level. I think I'm going to get a headache...」
all
Misa
「Hello. I was told by Natsuki-san that you were in a state of emergency... How may I assist you?」

Natsuki
「Misa-san, save me! Could you help me study!?」
Misa
「Help you study? I certainly don't mind... Which subjects would you like me to help you with?」

Natsuki
「All of them!」
Misa
「A-All of them? Um... What would your best subject be...?」

Natsuki
「Gym!」
Misa
「...My, how worrying.」
Gotta hand it to Segawa.
I can't believe she could bring Okihara-senpai to this point so easily, when she's got grades near the top of her school year.
all
Marika
「Um, I guess Narusawa-san and I can teach 
Hino-kun 
him 
and Yukimura-san, then?」

Marika
「I don't know if I'll be able to help much, but I'll do my best.」
％Ｂ
「Sorry about this. That'd be great. Focus on humanities, please. I'll help with Touko and Segawa once I'm done too.」


all
Touko
「I'm bad at math and science... Numbers are no fun at all.」


Rikka
「I think I'll tutor Yukimura-san, then.」
Rikka
「Shinozaki-san, are you okay being in charge of 
Hino-kun
him
?」
Marika
「Mhm, okay. Let's get started, then.」
all
Time flies when you're focused.
It's sundown before I know it.
Marika
「It's almost time for us to have to go. Do you want to keep going for a little more?」

Natsuki
「I want to, but... I don't think my will can last much longer...」
Misa
「Let's try for just a bit longer, shall we? I will give you some documents to help you prepare, so please finish the problems on them by tomorrow.」


Natsuki
「...I just broke. I could hear my heart snap into two.」
Touko
「Ahaha, looks like you're not too cheery in times like these either, Camera-chan.」

all
Rikka
「You're not in any position to be laughing either, Yukimura-san... We won't be able to cover all the exam material at this rate, you know.」

Touko
「What? Is there really that much? You never said thaaat.」
Rikka
「I explained it to you earlier... Pages 48 to 91 in the textbook, with trigonometric functions and exponential...」

Touko
「Agh, wait. I'm getting a headache just hearing those words.」
Natsuki
「I get what you meeean. It's not just my head for me, my stomach hurts too.」

Rikka
「...Perhaps you two should take your exams in the infirmary?」
Narusawa, that's a definite no.
Touko would fall asleep for sure!
all
Marika
「I have medicine for that, so let me know if you need any, okay?」
％Ｂ
「...Y-Yeah, thanks.」
all
Natsuki
「...Done! How is it!? It's good, right!?」
Misa
「Yes, it's correct! I knew you could do it if you tried, Natsuki-san!」

$$chr_gkbr
Natsuki
「W-Well, yeah...! It's a piece of cake once I'm motivated...!」

...You're clearly at your limit.
It's probably from the headaches and stomach pain.
Get Shinozaki to give you some of that medicine.
Touko
「Camera-chan, there's smoke coming out from your head.」
Natsuki
「Seriously!? Yes! That's so cool!」
Misa
「Let's continue on like this! Next will be world history! It's nothing more than simple memorization, so it will be very easy!」

Natsuki
「...I can't fit any more than this... I'm going to end up pushing the equations I just learned back out of my head...」

Segawa deflates before our very eyes.
I think she might completely wither away by the time we get to the actual exams.
all
Rikka
「Yukimura, focus on your own studying. You're not in any position to be worried about others, right?」

Touko
「Geez, you're so strict. Can't you just accept that people have their strengths and weaknesses?」

Rikka
「You'll just have to put in more effort if it's a weakness. Let's get to this page before we have to leave.」

Touko
「...Piano-chan's bullying meee.」
Rikka
「I told you not to call me that... I'm adding another page to your quota.」

Touko
「Whaaat!? I can't do thaaat! What do you have against me!?」

Narusawa's being thorough about helping Touko with her studying too.
Seems like they're making good progress, despite how it looks.
all
Marika
「I think you might be good already
, Hino-kun

.」
She gives me a satisfied smile after looking at my notebook.
I think I'll be able to handle what's going to be on the exams thanks to Shinozaki's help.
％Ｂ
「It's 'cause you're a good teacher. I think I'll be able to get by for exams now.」

Marika
「It's your first time taking exams at Shionagi Academy. I hope you do your best and get good grades.」

Shinozaki's smile makes me feel strangely motivated.
Maybe she's just good at looking after others.
all
％Ｂ
「All right, I think I'll switch over to the helping side, then. I'll help you out with Touko, Narusawa.」
Rikka
「I'd appreciate it. I'll keep careful watch to make sure Yukimura-san doesn't slack off.」

Touko
「...I'm booored. I can't do any more than thiiis.」
all
Marika
「I'll help Segawa-san, then. World history is just remembering things, so you'll get good grades for sure if you just put the time in.」

Misa
「Yes, Natsuki-san. You can do it if you try! We must finish until here by the end of today!」

Okihara-senpai's an unexpectedly passionate teacher.
She's a really thoughtful, considerate person... So I'm sure she'll take care of Segawa until the very end.
Natsuki
「...Like I said, I just wanna not fail.」
all
Touko
「Ahhh... I used my brain too muuuch... I've never studied this much befooore...」

％Ｂ
「Narusawa sure was strict...」
Touko kept trying to mess around with me over each and every thing.
Narusawa ended up exploding at her. "Take this seriously!"
And it didn't end up going anywhere because Touko just thought it was funny.
Touko
「I teased her a bit too much. Piano-chan's always so serious.」

％Ｂ
「I think you should get a little more serious when it comes to studying for exams... What are your grades like for subjects other than math?」

Touko
「I'm bad at aaall of the sciences. Humanities... I'm decent at humanities. I could probably get full marks if the reading passage's interesting enough? Though I don't really care as long as I don't fail.」


Touko doesn't seem like she particularly cares about her grades. Her stance seems to be that it's fine as long as she gets the bare minimum in terms of points on her exams.

Touko
「Geez, no more study talk right now! Let's talk about something more fuuun!」

％Ｂ
「All right... Then let's think about what we'll do after exams.」

Touko
「Oh, that's a good idea! Mmm... What should we do to plaaay?」
％Ｂ
「It'll be summer break for us, so we'll have even more time to spend together. I think we could do a lot of things.」

Touko
「A lot of things... Lots of things over summer break... Hehe, you're so dirty.」
％Ｂ
「What!? Wh-Why am I dirty!?」
Touko
「Mmm... I just kinda assumed you might be thinking about that kinda stuff. Was I right?」

％Ｂ
「Gh...」
...I can't say with utmost confidence that she was wrong.
I can't help but eventually imagine those kinds of scenes when I think about spending time with Touko.

％Ｂ
「Just so you know, it's not all that kinda stuff, all right!? I've been thinking about other stuff too!」

Touko
「Ahahah! Don't worry, don't worry! I already know!」

％Ｂ
「Seriously...?」
Touko
「...So that means I can look forward to that, right? Girls... think about things like that too.」

Ack. I'm starting to get really excited for summer!
I need to endure it and study for now, so we can enjoy our summer break together.

％Ｂ
「...Let's do our best. It's just until exams are over. And let's have tons of fun once we're done.」

Touko
「Mhm! I'm so excited!」
all
We'll be done with exams by this time next week.
I'm gonna focus on studying this week, so I can start summer break with a smile.
【Touko】_st_0302
【Touko】「I can't do this anymore.」
I expected this... and I guess it really happened.
【％Ｂ】「Can't figure it out?」
【Touko】_st_0312
【％Ｂ】_st_0307
【Touko】「Don't thaw meeee.」
【％Ｂ】「Do your best.」
【％Ｂ】「We won't be able to #Nhave fun afterward #Notherwise.」
【Touko】_st_0303
【Touko】「I don't want that.」
【％Ｂ】「Do your best then.」
【Touko】_st_0313
【％Ｂ】「Don't get scared.」
【Touko】_st_0306
【％Ｂ】「Crying isn't gonna make #Nyou smarter.」
【Touko】_st_0304
【％Ｂ】「Calm down.」
【Touko】_st_0302
【Touko】「I'll try a little more.」
【％Ｂ】「Yeah, do that.」
...Is she really going to be okay?
I feel like I should keep an eye on her.
【％Ｂ】「Wanna come over this #Nweekend? I'll help you #Nstudy.」
【Touko】_st_0301
【Touko】「I'll go I'll go! #NTeach me!」
【Touko】_st_0314
【％Ｂ】「Got it. Do your best on #Nyour own for today and #Ntomorrow, all right?」
【Touko】「Okay!」
【Touko】_st_0315
I need to do the best I can too.
How lame would I be if I didn't know what I was trying to teach her?
％Ｂ
「Right! Let's do a little more!」
