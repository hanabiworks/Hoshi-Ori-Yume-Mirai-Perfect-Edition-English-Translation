Natsuki
「Mmm... Very nice.」
Segawa nods in satisfaction as she takes photos of some empty after-school scenery.

all
I don't have any particular work to do for the event committee today.
The naturalist club does actually have things to do, but there isn't much need for me to help.

I was told that I would be needed for something tomorrow instead.
And so I have to follow Segawa around as her assistant for my day off.

％Ｂ
「Hey... Is it fun for you to take photos of just hallways and stairs and stuff?」
Natsuki
「What do you think?」
％Ｂ
「...You mind if I'm honest with you? I have absolutely no idea what you find appealing about it.」
Natsuki
「Ahaha, that's way too honest. But I get what you're trying to say.」

Natsuki
「You're probably thinking there's no point in getting photos of hallways and stairs because you could find those anywhere, right?」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, pretty much.」
Natsuki
「Yeah, I can see why you might think that now. But... what would you think if you saw photos of this school years later, or tens of years later?」


％Ｂ
「Well... I guess I'd feel nostalgic.」
Natsuki
「Right. They might just be photos of normal, boring scenery now, but with time they'll become nostalgic photos. Even though the photos themselves haven't changed one bit.」


Natsuki
「I bet the you ten or twenty years from now'll say something different from now once you see these photos.」

Natsuki
「For you, these won't just be stairs or a hallway. They'll be a place where you once were. A place where you started out. A place you left behind.」

Natsuki
「You'll feel nostalgic, and sad at the same time. Because you won't ever be able to come back here.」

％Ｂ
「...」
Natsuki
「So? Don't you think even photos of just hallways or stairs would become different for you that way?」

％Ｂ
「...I do. Actually, I'm kinda genuinely impressed you had something like that in mind.」

Natsuki
「Hmhmh, well? Do you see me in a new light now?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah... But now that I'm thinking of it that way, photos are really amazing.」
Natsuki
「Aren't they? That's one thing that's really fun about photography.」
Natsuki
「Now then... Let's change locations.」
We go to the inner courtyard, and Segawa immediately starts taking pictures of the flowerbed and a bird that's perching in the trees.

The bird immediately flies away, probably spooked by the shutter click.

Natsuki
「Oh, that's a shame. It got away.」
％Ｂ
「Was that a sparrow just now?」
Natsuki
「Yeah. I think it's the one that's made a nest under the roof of the old school building.」
％Ｂ
「Huh, I didn't know there was a nest there.」
Natsuki
「I assume it's laying eggs there, so I'm planning on taking photos of its chicks once they hatch.」

％Ｂ
「Oh yeah, that sounds nice. Let me see those photos once you get them.」
Natsuki
「Excuse me? What are you talking about? You're going to be helping me get them, 'cause you're my assistant.」

％Ｂ
「Ah, I forgot...」
Segawa sits down on a bench and starts looking through the photos she's taken.
I sit next to her and just vaguely watch our surroundings.
％Ｂ
「...You know.」
Natsuki
「Mm...?」
％Ｂ
「It kinda looks like we're on a date right now.」
Natsuki
「...」
Natsuki
「Wha... Wh-Wh-What!? Wh-What are... What are you even saying? What the heck are you talking about!?」

％Ｂ
「Huh?」
Natsuki
「On... On a date...? That makes it sound like... w-we're boyfriend and girlfriend... Is that what you're saying!?」

％Ｂ
「U-Uh...?」
I was just kinda trying to make small talk...
She's the one who casually brought up confessions of love yesterday and stuff.
％Ｂ
「Oh, uhh, well... M-My bad! I-I didn't mean anything weird by that...」

Crap. I'm freaking out 'cause of the way Segawa's reacting.
％Ｂ
「I-I was... I was just thinking... Someone who doesn't know anything about us might think something like that, you know...?」

Natsuki
「Oh... Oh, ohh... Y-Yeah, you're riiight, yeah they might misunderstand! It wouldn't really bother me or anything, but yeah, we might not want that...」


％Ｂ
「Y-Yeah, I know, right! It wouldn't really bother me either... but we wouldn't want that, yeah...」

Natsuki
「...」
％Ｂ
「...」
The heck's with this mood...
％Ｂ
「Segawa... Your face is bright red...」
Natsuki
「...You too... You look like a tomato...」
％Ｂ
「...Maybe I'll try taking some photos too...」
all
I stand up from the bench.
Natsuki
「Uh... And I'll continue where I left off...!」
Segawa also stands up, and we both put some distance between the two of us.
％Ｂ
「...What the hell am I doing... Man...」
I said I was gonna take photos, so I grab my phone and start up the camera app.

％Ｂ
「I guess I'll take some pictures of flowers or something...」
I point my phone at the flowerbed.
％Ｂ
「Uhh... Huh? It's not really focusing...」
I've never really used my phone camera much...
Natsuki
「Aghh, you're doing it all wrong!」
％Ｂ
「Wha...?」
I turn around to see the previously red-faced Segawa walking up to me with a serious expression.

Natsuki
「It's going to come out blurry like that.」
％Ｂ
「Huh? Oh... You think so? I think it'll be fine, though.」
Natsuki
「Taking a photo with one hand's completely illogical! You have to hold it properly with both hands, and pull your arms in!」

％Ｂ
「L-Like this?」
Natsuki
「Take the elbow of your supporting arm and push it against your own body!」
％Ｂ
「R-Right.」
Natsuki
「Here, I'll lend you the camera, so try holding it up!」
％Ｂ
「Uh... No, it's okay, I'll just use my...」
Natsuki
「Just do it!」
％Ｂ
「Sure...」
all
Natsuki
「Aghh, no, that's wrong! Like this! This!」
％Ｂ
「R-Right...」
Segawa stands behind me and extends her arms to show me how to properly hold the camera up.

Natsuki
「Look, your arms are out to your sides again. I told you, you have to pull them in!」

I can hear her voice right in my ear.
Which is only natural, considering she's pretty much right up against me because of the overly passionate lesson.
Natsuki
「Try taking a photo for now.」
％Ｂ
「Okay...」
Natsuki
「Looks blurry. It's because your hands are shaking. You need to relax more.」

I can feel something soft being pushed against my shoulders and chest.
I can feel her breathing on my ear.
...There's a rather nice smell tickling my nostrils.
Natsuki
「C'mon, take another.」
％Ｂ
「...」
Natsuki
「Hmm, it's a little better, but still not great. Are you nervous or something? Relax, relax.」

She massages my shoulders.
Excuse me, teacher, this is just making it harder to relax...
Natsuki
「Oh, look over there! The sparrow's back!」
She points to a single sparrow perched on a tree branch.
Natsuki
「Are you ready? Press the shutter button when I say so, okay?」
％Ｂ
「S-Sure...」
I bring the camera up to my face and await Segawa's command.
Segawa keeps herself pressed against me as she waits for the right moment.
％Ｂ
「...Gulp...」
Natsuki
「Now!」
I press the button pretty much on reflex.
％Ｂ
「Did... I get it?」
Natsuki
「Show me the camera.」
She manipulates the controls to pull up the photo I just took on the screen.

Natsuki
「Here. This is the photo you took.」
all
％Ｂ
「Oh...? Ohh? Ohhhh!?」
It's a photo of the sparrow just about to take flight, with its wings spread open wide.

The sparrow's in sharp focus, with the background nicely out of focus.

The contrast between foreground and background really accentuates the fact that it's "taking flight."
％Ｂ
「Holy... What the heck? I've never taken a photo like this before!」

I've genuinely captured a "moment" in time.
Natsuki
「Of course you haven't. You can't really get photos like this with a smartphone camera.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah...」
Natsuki
「What do you think? Isn't photography fun?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah... It is...!」
Natsuki
「I'm going to be taking photos for the naturalist club like this tomorrow, so I'll need you backing me up.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah. You can count on me.」
I nod, genuinely amazed by the photo I took.
