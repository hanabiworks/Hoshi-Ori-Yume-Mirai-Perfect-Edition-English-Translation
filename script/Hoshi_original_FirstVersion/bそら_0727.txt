Sora frowns as she takes her hoodie off.
Sora
「...Cough... Cough...」
％Ｂ
「You okay?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「You've still got some around your mouth. I'll wipe it, so look up.」
Sora
「...Mm...」
She closes her eyes and tilts her head upward a little.
There's white semen stuck on her cheeks, which are a little flushed from her coughing.
％Ｂ
「...」
I can't help but feel a little horny again when I see her like this.\n\r

This is ridiculous. I just came twice already...
％Ｂ
「Sora...」
Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「...」
Sora
「...Your phone.」
％Ｂ
「...Right.」
all
％Ｂ
「...Shuuichi?」
Sora
「...You aren't going to answer?」
％Ｂ
「Huh? Oh... Yeah, I will.」
all
He's not someone who would call this early for no reason.
He might have something he needs to talk to me about...

％Ｂ
「Hello?」
Shuuichi
『
Ryousuke
Hey
! Come to school right away!』
No greeting or anything.
This seems really serious.
％Ｂ
「What's wrong? What are you yelling for so early in the―」
Shuuichi
『Just come! There's a problem with the cardboard!』
％Ｂ
「What? The cardboard!?」
As in, the cardboard everyone collected for us!?
Shuuichi
『And tell Ousaka to come here right away too! I don't know how to get in touch with her! I'm having Shinozaki tell the others.』


％Ｂ
「G-Got it!」
_smh_st_04
I hang up and turn toward Sora.
％Ｂ
「There's apparently some kind of problem. We need to go to school right away.」

Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「Shuuichi! What happened!?」
Sora and I come to the classroom in the old school building.
The others are all already here, including Shuuichi.
Their expressions are all cloudy and dark, in stark contrast to the beautiful post-hurricane weather.

Marika
「Oh... Uuh～」
％Ｂ
「What's wrong? What happened?」
Natsuki
「...There was a leak.」
％Ｂ
「Wha... A leak?」
all
Shuuichi
「...The hurricane last night apparently blew off part of this building's roof. There's a lot of water that's leaked into the classrooms.」

％Ｂ
「...Wait, so you mean the cardboard's...」

Sora
「...
Ryou
Look
...」
Sora points at the corner.
all
％Ｂ
「Oh...」
She's indicating the stack of cardboard that everyone worked so hard to collect.\n\r

Which now just is a soaking wet mess...
％Ｂ
「...You've... You've gotta be kidding me...」
I look up at the roof. There's a big black stain right above the stack of cardboard.

Even now, there are blackened droplets of water dripping down from above.
Shuuichi
「...Dammit... This is my bad... I knew the old school building was deteriorating. I should've known this could happen... I don't know how I can apologize...」


Misa
「No... I do not believe it to be your fault, Shuuichi-san.」
Touko
「Seriously. No one could predict the roof getting blown off. This isn't anyone's fault.」


Shuuichi
「But...」
％Ｂ
「No one thinks it's your fault.」
all
I approach the mountain of cardboard.
I try to pick up the sheet at the very top. It tears under its own weight.

Rikka
「It doesn't look usable.」
％Ｂ
「...No... That's not true.」
Marika
「Wha...?」
I pull away the wet cardboard starting from the top.
The sheets at the top tear easily, but once I get lower down, I find more and more that are either just deformed or slightly wet.


％Ｂ
「There's still cardboard toward the bottom that looks usable.」
Misa
「Is there really!?」
The others also walk up to the cardboard.
Marika
「You're right. Look at this one. I don't think it's that wet.」
Rikka
「This one's only wet at the edge, so we could probably use it if we cut it.」

Touko
「What the heck, a lot of it looks usable.」
％Ｂ
「Let's start by sorting the cardboard into what looks usable and what doesn't, and we'll let the usable ones dry out in the sun.」

all
Sora counts the sheets of cardboard drying in the sun.

all
％Ｂ
「We were able to collect more cardboard than we originally planned, right?」

Shuuichi
「Yeah. So we wouldn't have to worry in case we ran into issues cutting the shapes out.」
all
There's a lot of cardboard that's absolutely unusable, but there's a lot more that survived.\n\r

I just hope there's still enough...
％Ｂ
「What do you think, Sora? Do you think we still have enough?」
Sora writes down her cardboard count into a notebook and puts the pen down.

And then―
Sora
「...Mm.」
She gives us a thumbs-up.
Sora
「...Just barely enough.」
all
Marika
「Hahhh～...」
Natsuki
「Phew...」
Misa
「Sigh...」
We all breathe out in relief.
all
Shuuichi
「Honestly... I was really worried earlier. Looks like we'll be able to get started on the construction still, then. That's a relief.」


Rikka
「Shouldn't we store the cardboard in a different location from now on? A hurricane might be predictable, but we never know when we might get hit by a surprise rainstorm.」


％Ｂ
「That's true... I wonder if there's anywhere good...」
all
Touko
「Oh, there's a big metal locker inside the storage room over there. I think the cardboard could probably even survive the building collapsing if we put it in there.」


％Ｂ
「Oh, now that's the owner of the building for you. You know your stuff.」
Touko
「Ahaha, guess I do.」
％Ｂ
「All right, let's move the cardboard into there once it's dried.」
all
Misa
「I will go look at the fish tanks, then.」
％Ｂ
「Speaking of which, was the aquarium fine during the storm?」
Misa
「Yes, it appears there was no damage. I had been worried that the pumps may stop in the event of a power outage, but they were working without issue this morning when I came to check.」


Marika
「I'll go with Okihara-san, then.」
Natsuki
「I think I'll go watch the fish and relax too. It's not like we can do anything until the cardboard's dry anyway.」

all
Touko
「I'm hungry, so I'm going to go get something to eat. Anyone wanna come with?」

Rikka
「Now that I think about it, I haven't eaten breakfast, so I'm hungry too.」
％Ｂ
「I'll go buy some food for everyone, then.」
Touko
「Oh, there we go! Thank you for the meal!」
％Ｂ
「That doesn't mean it's my treat, all right? You better pay me back.」
Touko
「Whaaaat? Tch.」
all
％Ｂ
「Anyone got anything they wanna eat?」
Natsuki
「Pizza!」

Shuuichi
「Gyudon.」
all
Marika
「Pancakes or something...?」
Misa
「I would like sandwiches!」
Rikka
「I'm fine with anything.」
all
Touko
「Morning steak!」
％Ｂ
「...Couldn't you guys at least make it all the same kinda cuisine...?」
all
Sora
「...Burgers.」
Saw that coming...
Natsuki
「Burgers sound good too.」
all
Marika
「I'll have one too, then.」
Misa
「That would be fine with me as well.」
all
Rikka
「I'll go with the majority.」
Touko
「Oh geez... Well, I don't wanna be the only one asking for something different, so I think I might go for a burger too.」

all
Shuuichi
「If we want burgers, then McRonald delivers.」
％Ｂ
「We're gonna have them deliver to school?」
Shuuichi
「We can just go get it from them at the front gates once they're here.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, okay... Yeah, that sounds good.」
Shuuichi
「We can order through cell phone, so I'll put the order together.」
％Ｂ
「Let's do that, then.」
all
Everyone tells Shuuichi their burger order one by one.
Sora
「...Burger delivery...!」
I don't miss Sora's eyes glittering with excitement at the prospect of a hamburger delivery service.\n\r

This might've been dangerous information for Sora to have obtained...
all
Shuuichi
「Food's here.」
Shuuichi walks into the room holding two paper bags as we're all watching the fish tanks.

all
I take one of the bags from him to help hand the food out.
％Ｂ
「Let's see... Who got the teriyaki?」
Touko
「Oh, that's miiine.」
％Ｂ
「Cheeseburger?」
all
Marika
「Oh, that might be mine, I think.」
％Ｂ
「Fish burger... Is that you, Senpai?」
all
Misa
「It is indeed. Ufufu.」
％Ｂ
「And the regular hamburger's Sora.」
all
Sora
「...*nod*」
all
We all eat burgers together, surrounded by rows of soothing fish tanks.
Touko
「Eating in a place like this isn't too bad.」
Shuuichi
「Yeah, it's a pretty nice location.」
Marika
「The burgers seem even tastier than usual like this.」
We're all relieved after finding out the wet cardboard wouldn't be a major issue.


all
Sora
「Hgh...!」
Sora freezes mid-bite.
％Ｂ
「Hm... What's wrong?」
Sora
「...」
She stares at me sadly.
％Ｂ
「Ah... The pickles...」
Natsuki
「Sora, you don't like pickles?」
Shuuichi
「My bad. I should've asked when I was taking the orders.」
Sora
「...Mm.」
She holds out the half-eaten burger to me just like always.
There's a pickle with a tiny bite mark on it peeking out from inside.
％Ｂ
「Sure.」
I bring my face up to her burger and grab just the pickles with my teeth.\n\r

I crunch away.
Sora
「...Thanks.」
Sora smiles happily... Meanwhile, the others are all lost for words.
all
％Ｂ
「Mgmgh... Gulp... What's up, you guys?」
Natsuki
「Ahh... It suuure is hot in here. Wonder if we could get an AC unit. It's just soooo hot.」


Misa
「How very heartwarming. Ufufu.」
all
Marika
「That was so bold of you, Ousaka-san～」
Rikka
「How shameless...」
Touko
「Such practiced movements. Do you two always do that? You do, don't you?」

Shuuichi
「Hmph... I-I do stuff like that all the time too...」

％Ｂ
「Gasp!」
Crap...
We did the usual thing out of sheer habit, even though everyone else was around...
all
Natsuki
「Ahh... So, so hot.」
％Ｂ
「Ughhh...」
all
How embarrassing...
I can't help but blush...
And as for Sora...
all
Sora
「...」
Her face is bright red too.
all
Sora
「...」
Sora's staring intently at the tanks with the jellyfish after we're done eating.
Misa
「Sora-san, have you come to like the jellyfish?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
Sora
「...There's a jellyfish... in space, too.」
％Ｂ
「Hm? There is? Not "there are"?」
Sora
「...There is.」
Misa
「Would that perhaps be some form of martian?」
Sora
「...There are no reports of martian life. It's just a high probability that it exists.」
％Ｂ
「So what's the space jellyfish, then?」
Sora
「There's a supernova remnant at Gemini's feet called the Jellyfish Nebula.」
％Ｂ
「Huh, really.」
Misa
「I would love to see it!」
Ohh, Senpai's interest's been piqued.
Sora
「...Unfortunately, it's impossible with the naked eye. It's a little difficult even with a telescope.」
Misa
「I see... That's a shame.」
She's clearly crestfallen.
I guess she really wanted to see it...
Sora
「...I'll bring a photo.」
Misa
「Will you really? Thank you so very much, Sora-san!」
She hugs Sora out of sheer happiness.
Sora
「...Mgh...」
Misa
「I'm very excited to see it!」
Sora
「...Uuh... *nod*...」
all
We go home for the day after putting the dried cardboard in the storage-room locker.

We all file toward the bus stop.
％Ｂ
「It's fun doing stuff with others, huh?」
I try saying it to Sora as the two of us walk along behind the others.
Sora
「...*nod*」
Sora
「...This is all thanks to you too
, Ryou

.」
％Ｂ
「Me?」
Sora
「...They all met because of you
, Ryou

. Same for me.」
％Ｂ
「...I didn't do that much. But, well... I guess if I had to say, then I think it might be thanks to the stars.」

Sora
「...The stars?」
％Ｂ
「You were looking at the stars the night we first met too, right? I called out to you 'cause you caught my interest that way.」

Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「And it was stars again when we met for the second time. We were able to meet again because that star-shaped tanzaku came falling down from the rooftop. The wish that you wrote on there came true that way.」


Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「You're really cute when you're watching the stars, and you always look so happy when you're talking about them. I was attracted to those parts of you.」


Sora
「...
Ryou
Oh..
.」
％Ｂ
「The stars were shining up there in the night sky back when I confessed, and when you accepted my feelings too. The stars have always been watching us.」


％Ｂ
「And all of us got as close as we are now because you showed all of us the stars with that astronomical telescope and communicated the wonders of the stars to us, right?」


％Ｂ
「So it's all thanks to the stars.」
Sora
「...Thanks to the stars...」
％Ｂ
「The stars really do bring encounters, I guess.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
We smile at each other.
Natsuki
「What are the two of you grinning at each other for? The bus is coming!」
％Ｂ
「Okay, coming!」
％Ｂ
「Let's go, Sora.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
