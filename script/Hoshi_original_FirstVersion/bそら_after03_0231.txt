I'm submitting my design proposal for the science museum to the city's competition committee today.

％Ｂ
「Thank you very much!」
I've done everything I can, the best I can.
If it doesn't work out... Then that's fine by me.
...No, I think I might get a bit bitter.
But even if it really doesn't work out, then I'm sure the effort I put in for this won't go to waste.\n\r

It'll connect to the next endeavor for sure... I'm sure of it.
Sora's waiting for me when I walk out from city hall.
Sora
「...Done?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah... Done. I submitted my proposal. As for what happens next, well, god only knows.」

Sora
「...*shake shake*」
Sora
「...Mo-san only knows.」
％Ｂ
「W-Well, I guess you could say that, yeah...」
all
One of the judges is my mentor, the architect Azuma Morio.
There's even the harsh condition that if Azuma-san isn't satisfied with any of the designs, everyone fails.

％Ｂ
「Either way, there's nothing I can do now. All that's left is to sit back and wait for the results.」

Sora
「...*nod*」
Sora and I head back to the firm together.
Sora
「...? ...Another magazine.」
Sora holds out another largish envelope to me after checking the mailbox.
％Ｂ
「Oh yeah, that's probably one of my usual subscriptions.」
Sora
「...There's a stamp that says "Sample Copy" on the front.」
Sample copy?
％Ｂ
「...Wait, is that...」
Sora
「...It might be the one Natsu was talking about.」
％Ｂ
「Let's open it.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
all
I unseal the envelope and take out the magazine.
It's a booklet-style magazine titled "Twenty Amazing Architects!"

There's a sticky note stuck in a certain page.
％Ｂ
「...I'm gonna open it.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
all
I flip to the page with the sticky note.
％Ｂ
「...Oh.」
Sora
「...Ohh...」
I see the photos Segawa took of me last month.
The credits next to them say "Photography: Segawa Natsuki."
My answers to the email interview are written on the opposite page.
Sora
「...What a smile.」
％Ｂ
「...It's 'cause you were tickling me.」
all
All of the other architects either have a serious expression or a smile.

I'm the only one who looks like he's cracking up.
％Ｂ
「...It's, uh... I kinda look like an idiot...」
Sora
「...*shake shake*」
Sora
「...That's not true... You're the coolest one, Ryou.」
Sora
「...That's not true... You're the best-looking one.」
％Ｂ
「But look, I'm the only one who looks like he's laughing.」
Sora
「...It's very memorable... You might get fan mail.」

％Ｂ
「Nope, no way.」
She's way too biased.
But I guess it's fine since she's proud of me...?
