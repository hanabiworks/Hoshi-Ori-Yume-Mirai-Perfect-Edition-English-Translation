「Phew... It's finally over. Our principal always talks for way too long...」

I wondered why an elementary school principal needed to talk for so long.\n\r

He just kept on talking and talking, even though no one was listening.
I wish I could've complained to someone about it, but there was no one familiar around me.\n\r

Because I had just changed classes.
None of my friends were in my new class.
I looked around to see if there was anyone that looked interesting.
？？？／真里花
「...」
I was disappointed when I looked at the girl next to me.
She was kind of a gloomy-looking girl.
She was sitting quietly, looking downward.
I figured she probably doesn't like people like me either.
And then when I looked away...
Hyuuuh... Hyuuuh...
I heard something that sounded like someone trying to whistle badly.
？？？／真里花
「Hahh, hahh... Hyuuhh...」
％Ｂ
「What did you say? You okay?」

I could tell right away that it wasn't just her messing around.
I realized that the sound was her straining to breathe.
％Ｂ
「You got a cold? You should go to the nurse's office then.」

？？？／真里花
「No, it's not a cold... Cough... cough, cough...」

She suddenly started coughing.
It wasn't a normal cough.
It was almost scary how intense it sounded. I had never seen someone cough like this before.
％Ｂ
「Y-You should really go to the nurse's office. I'll take you there.」

？？？／真里花
「I-I have... I have medicine... in the pouch in my bag...」

％Ｂ
「Medicine? In a pouch...」
I opened her backpack.
I felt bad about doing it without asking, but it didn't seem like this was the time to be polite.
I found what I was looking for right away.
It was an incredibly girly-looking pouch, covered in cute little characters.

％Ｂ
「This?」
？？？／真里花
「Mhm... Take out... hyuhh... what's inside...」
She looked really bad.
I felt like her face had gotten paler.
I frantically opened the pouch.
There was something that looked like a whistle inside.
It didn't really look like medicine, but there was nothing else.
？？？／真里花
「That... Hyuh, wheeze... hyuhhh...」
I didn't know what was going on, but it looked bad.
％Ｂ
「Hey, what do I do with this?」
？？？／真里花
「Put... My, mouth... Hyuh, hyuhhh...」
％Ｂ
「Your mouth? What do you mean?」
At this point, my new classmates had gathered around us to see what was causing the commotion.


「I know what that is! You're supposed to put it in your mouth and breathe in!」

I heard someone say that from the crowd.
％Ｂ
「Breathe in... Oh!」
I finally understood.
I thought it was a case for medicine, but I was wrong.
It was something you were supposed to put directly in your mouth.
％Ｂ
「You put this part in your mouth, right? Hey! Come on! I'll give you the medicine right now!」


I managed to get her to breathe in the medicine, with some help from more knowledgeable classmates.
Our new homeroom teacher came running into the room at that point. Someone must have called for him.

Homeroom Teacher
「Shinozaki, are you okay!? Let's get her to the nurse's office right away! Someone go there to tell them we're bringing her!」


％Ｂ
「I-I'll go!!」
I waited with Shinozaki in the nurse's office until after school, when her parents came to pick her up.

Homeroom Teacher
「I hear you've been with her this whole time. Thank you, and good work. There's no need to worry, so you should go home.」


％Ｂ
「...Is she sick or something?」
Homeroom Teacher
「She is. Shinozaki has asthma.」
He answered my question after a bit of thought.
％Ｂ
「Asthma... I didn't know asthma was that bad.」

Homeroom Teacher
「It can be. She's usually supposed to be resting when she's in bad shape, but she had to come today for the opening ceremony.」


％Ｂ
「That's so stupid. She didn't need to come just to listen to the principal talk.」


Homeroom Teacher
「Shinozaki's been in bad shape a lot lately. She hasn't been able to stay a whole day too often. I'm sure she wanted to be here until the end at least today.」


％Ｂ
「Oh... She has it rough.」

I had never even considered that someone would want to stay at school all day.
I almost thought it was kind of a pain.
Every now and then I'd even want to go home early.
But that was the first time that I learned that there were people out there that considered going to school until the end of the day to be special.

％Ｂ
「Is she gonna get better?」
Homeroom Teacher
「Are you worried?」
My homeroom teacher smiled when I nodded.

「If I recall, 
Hino, 

your house is on Izumigaoka, right? Do you think you could deliver these printouts to Shinozaki? I completely forgot to give them to her.」

％Ｂ
「Okay. I will.」
Shinozaki's house happened to be right on the way back from school.
％Ｂ
「Uhh... It's here.」
I rang the doorbell after checking the nameplate.
％Ｂ
「...Oh.」
I glanced up to see Shinozaki in the second-floor window.
She looked a lot better than she did at school.
％Ｂ
「Heeey!」
Shinozaki
「Oh...!」
She quickly hid when she noticed me.
％Ｂ
「Why'd she hide? Does she hate me?」

Yumi
「Sorry about that. She's just shy.」
％Ｂ
「Oh...」
I looked back down to see that the door had opened. There was a woman about my mother's age standing there, smiling at me.

It was Shinozaki's mom. Yumi-san.
Yumi
「Are you one of Marika's friends from school?」
％Ｂ
「Oh, uh... We're going to be in the same class starting today, so we're not friends yet. She's kinda avoiding me too, so...」


Yumi
「I'm sorry about that. Marika's really shy. She can never ask people to be friends with her.」

Yumi
「But... she does want to have friends. Could you be her friend?」

％Ｂ
「Yeah. I can.」
Yumi
「Ufufu. Thank you very much. She might not be able to go to school that much... but I hope the two of you become good friends.」


％Ｂ
「Mhm... Yes.」
And so Shinozaki and I were arranged to become friends.
We actually did become good friends after that, of course...
$$smh_OpenCHK
％Ｂ
「Comiiing.」
I open the door. Shinozaki's standing there.
She seems a bit nervous.
She came to pick me up, just like she said she would yesterday.
Marika
「G-Good morning～」
％Ｂ
「No reason to be so nervous, you know. I'm the only one here.」

Marika
「That's why I'm nervous...」
％Ｂ
「You mean...」
Marika
「N-Never mind! Let's go then!」

％Ｂ
「Uh, okay?」
％Ｂ
「This feels kinda weird.」
Marika
「Huh? What does?」
％Ｂ
「'Cause you know, I was always the one who went to your place in elementary school. But this time, you came to mine.」

Shinozaki never ended up being able to go to school much while I was still living here.\n\r

So I always saw her when I went to her house.
The fact that Shinozaki came to my house is proof of just how much healthier she's gotten.

％Ｂ
「It makes me crazy happy for some reason.」
Marika
「It-It isn't that big of a deal. It's just me coming to pick you up.」

％Ｂ
「Aren't you happy, Shinozaki?」
Marika
「Huh? W-Well... I am... I'm really happy...」


％Ｂ
「Right?」
Honestly. I'm so happy for her.
Marika
「B-By the way, which class are you in?」
％Ｂ
「Uh, I think I'm in class C.」

Marika
「I'm in class A. Aw, it's a shame we're not in the same class.」

We can see each other whenever we want.
Things don't always work out the way we want.
％Ｂ
「Don't make that face. We can see each other whenever we want.」

Marika
「Y-Yeah... We can, right? We can see each other whenever we want, since we'll be at the same school.」


％Ｂ
「That's right. I'll come hang out in your classroom once I settle in.」

Marika
「Huh? My classroom?」
％Ｂ
「Maybe I shouldn't?」
Marika
「N-No, there's nothing wrong with it... I-I'm totally fine with it! It's okay with me!」

％Ｂ
「I guess things don't always work out the way we want.」
Marika
「Yeah. They really don't...」
Shinozaki seems down.
Maybe I should've phrased that a little differently?
％Ｂ
「Ah, that's right. I don't really know the school building that well yet. You think you could show me around during lunch break or something?」


Marika
「Oh, okay. Of course I can. I'll come to your classroom at lunch break, then.」

％Ｂ
「I'll be waiting in front of my classroom, then.」
Homeroom Teacher
「Now then, could you wait here until I call your name?」
％Ｂ
「Okay, I will.」
？？？／律佳
「...」
％Ｂ
「...Hm?」
I'm talking with my new homeroom teacher when a girl quietly walks toward us.

？？？／律佳
「...」
She glances at me...
And walks into the classroom.
I guess she must be a classmate of mine.
My homeroom teacher walks into the classroom a little after her.
I can hear the sound of the students standing up in unison.
％Ｂ
「...This is pretty nerve-racking.」
"Class 2-C"
So this is my class starting today.
I hope I can hit things off well with my classmates.
Actually, I remember we had a transfer student in elementary school.
I remember everyone in my class crowded around him to talk with him during break periods, because we had never had one before.

I wonder if I'm gonna end up in the same situation?
At our age? Probably not.
Imagine if no one was really interested in me instead...
That'd be one thing. Imagine if people actively ignored me when I tried to talk to them...
Hide my shoes, vandalize my desk, throw half-eaten bread in my locker―

Homeroom Teacher
「―kun? Hey
, Hino-kun?
?
」
％Ｂ
「Huh?」
Homeroom Teacher
「What's the matter? Hurry and come on in.」
％Ｂ
「Y-Yes...」
I take a deep breath and open the door.
I walk into the classroom. Everyone's eyes fall on me at the same time.
I walk up to the front of the classroom and stand next to the teacher, painfully aware of the attention.

Homeroom Teacher
「Now then, if you could introduce yourself.」
％Ｂ
「Okay... Uhh, I'm ％Ａ ％Ｂ. I transferred here from Kanagawa. Pleased to meet all of you.」

％Ｂ
「I actually used to live here in Shionagi up until elementary school―」
％Ｂ
「...Huh?」
I suddenly hear a familiar sound.
I can't help but focus my attention toward it, despite still being halfway through my self-introduction.
_00cutinBS
The camera belongs to a girl.
Oh. She's...
_00cutinBS
？？？／夏希
「Hey there!」
％Ｂ
「Oh!」
I remember fully once I see her smiling face emerge from behind the camera.\n \n\r
She's the one who almost fell... well technically, she and I actually fell down the stairs together the day before yesterday.

_00cutinBS
？？？／夏希
「I didn't think you'd end up in my class! Though this just makes things simpler for me.」

_00cutinBS
She then points the camera at me and clicks the shutter again.
_00cutinBS
Homeroom Teacher
「What's this? You know Segawa already?」
So her name's Segawa.
％Ｂ
「Yes. I got to know her when I was taking a look around the school the day before yesterday...」
A commotion starts in response to what I said.
Especially when I said "got to know her."
I can hear people saying... things like, "Whoa" or "Not bad."
Uh? Wait, what? Was what I said that weird?
...They don't think I'm quick to try to pick up girls or something, do they...?
all
Homeroom Teacher
「Quiet down, everyone.」
Homeroom Teacher
「It seems our transfer student's quite quick to make moves, but I hope you all get along well with him.」

So that's exactly what they thought!
Everyone laughs in response to our teacher's words.
Segawa
「Ahahahahahahahahah!」
She takes another photo of the scene.
It wasn't the introduction I had in mind, but it doesn't look like they think badly of me.

I guess I can consider myself to have been accepted?
all
％Ｂ
「...Ha... Haha.」
All I can do is laugh along.
Homeroom Teacher
「Let's see, as for your seat... The one next to Inamori's open. You can sit there.」

％Ｂ
「Okay. Thank you.」
There's a smiling girl waving at me, pointing at the empty seat next to her.\n\r

She must be Inamori-san.
Now that I'm looking a bit closer, it looks like everyone else is smiling at me too.
I think I'll get along just fine here.
Our homeroom teacher leaves the room after finishing morning homeroom, and I take the opportunity to walk to my new seat.

Classmate Girl A
「Nice to meet you!」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. Same here.」
I greet her and hook my bag onto my desk.
％Ｂ
「Oh...」
On the other side of me―
Sitting at the seat by the window...
？？？／律佳
「...」
Is the girl I saw in the hallway earlier.
So she sits next to me.
She's looking out the window, looking bored.
It's a quiet scene.
It's like she's been completely separated from this classroom.
I should say hello, since we're going to be sitting next to each other and all.
％Ｂ
「I know I just introduced myself up there, but I'm ％Ａ ％Ｂ. We'll be sitting next to each other starting today. Nice to meet you.」

？？？／律佳
「...」
？？？／律佳
「...Nice to meet you.」
Her voice is clear... It's like pure ice, without even a hint of bubbles or foam marring the surface.

She returns her gaze back out the window after a glance my way.

...She's pretty quiet.
all
Japanese Teacher
「Okay, looks like you're all seated. Class is starting!」
The teacher comes in with the bell, and so the curtain rises on my new school life.
First period ends, and break starts.
Segawa
「Hey, how's it going! Looks like things are already pretty crazy for you on your first day!」
％Ｂ
「You're... Segawa, right?」
Segawa
「Yup, Segawa Natsuki. I'll be your classmate, starting today. Nice to meet you!」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. Likewise.」
Natsuki
「What do you say about taking a photo as a greeting?」
She then brings the camera up to her face again and clicks the shutter.
％Ｂ
「You were pretty open about taking photos during homeroom too. I assume that's allowed, then?」

Natsuki
「Well, I am a member of the grad-alb committee.」
％Ｂ
「You were talking about that the day before yesterday too.」
Natsuki
「The grad-alb committee's allowed to take photos, at least to a certain extent. We can't do it during exams or during class for just no reason though, obviously.」

％Ｂ
「So it's okay as long as it's not disruptive?」
Natsuki
「Pretty much. That's why you need good morals and, more importantly, the ability to read the mood to be a member of the grad-alb committee.」


％Ｂ
「I get it.」
Natsuki
「Oh, by the way, you said in your introduction earlier that you used to live here in Shionagi, right?」

％Ｂ
「Yeah. I transferred out halfway through elementary school.」
Natsuki
「So then do you have old friends here at this school?」
％Ｂ
「I know at least one. Shinozaki Marika. We were classmates in elementary school.」

Natsuki
「Shinozaki Marika... Ohh, from class A.」
％Ｂ
「You know her?」
Natsuki
「Of course. She's a bit quiet, but she's cute and has a nice personality, so she's always been popular with the guys ever since her first year.」

％Ｂ
「Huh.」
The Shinozaki I know is popular with the guys, huh.
Natsuki
「A few guys have confessed to her, but as far as I know, she's rejected each one...」

She's even gotten confessed to!?
all
This is all too new of a concept for me, since I only know the Shinozaki from elementary school.
She's really grown in the time that I haven't seen her.
...Like in the chest region.
％Ｂ
「So you even know lots of stuff about people in other classes, huh.」
Natsuki
「Well yeah, I am a member of the grad-alb committee, after all～」
...Is that what grad-alb committees are supposed to be like?
I don't really get it, but those words seem to be her answer to everything.
Natsuki
「Hey, if you want, I can show you around school during lunch break. As thanks for helping me the other day... What do you think?」

Have her show me around.
Decline.
％Ｂ
「Well... Yeah, if you're offering──」
Whoops, no. I've already asked Shinozaki to show me around.
Natsuki
「Mmfufuuu.」
％Ｂ
「Uhh... Sorry. Shinozaki's actually already going to be showing me around.」

％Ｂ
「Uhh... I'm grateful for the offer, but actually, Shinozaki's going to be showing me around.」

％Ｂ
「So I'll accept just the sentiment.」
Natsuki
「Oh really... Shinozaki-san is, is she...」
％Ｂ
「...?」
...What's with that evil-looking smile?
all
I wait outside in the hallway for Shinozaki once lunch break starts.
％Ｂ
「...」
Natsuki
「...」
％Ｂ
「...」
Natsuki
「...」
Segawa's been next to me this whole time for some reason...
％Ｂ
「...What are you doing here, Segawa?」
Natsuki
「Huh? What do you mean? I'm waiting for someone.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, you too? Sorry for prying, then.」
Natsuki
「Shinozaki-san sure is late.」
％Ｂ
「Maybe her class is going late? I'm sure she'll show up soon enough.」
...Wait a second. Why's Segawa care about Shinozaki being late?
Segawa's got someone else she's waiting for, right?
all
Eventually...
？？？／律佳
「...」
The girl who sits next to me walks out from our classroom.
She's got something wrapped in cloth in her hands. Probably a lunchbox.
She's probably going to go eat lunch somewhere else.
As usual, her expression gives nothing away... Actually, she seems a bit cold.

Segawa elbows me while I idly watch her walk away.

Natsuki
「What's this now? Interested in Rikka?」
％Ｂ
「Rikka? That her name?」
Natsuki
「What, you're telling me you were staring at her like that without even knowing her name?」
％Ｂ
「She didn't tell me her name when I introduced myself.」
all
In fact, she never spoke to me even once after I introduced myself, even though we sit next to each other.

Even during breaks, either she'd plug some earphones into her smartphone and listen to music, or I'd turn around and she'd just be gone.

I haven't seen her talk with anyone else either.
Natsuki
「I'll tell you, then. Her last name's―」
％Ｂ
「Uh... You know what, it's fine.」
Natsuki
「Wha... Are you planning on calling her by her first name when you've barely even spoken to her so far? You're more of a Don Juan than I thought.」

％Ｂ
「No, I'm not. I'll just ask her myself.」
％Ｂ
「We sit next to each other, so it'd be nice if we could become friends, you know? I was thinking it might be a good opportunity to start up conversation.」

Natsuki
「Ohhh～ You've got an optimistic personality. But I think Rikka's going to be a bit of a difficult one.」

％Ｂ
「I don't expect to become friends with her right away. I'll go talk with her right now.」

Natsuki
「Have fun～」
I run over to her after Segawa's send-off.
％Ｂ
「Ri... Uhh, hey, you. Wait a second.」
I stop myself from calling her Rikka, and end up with an awkward start.
She moves her head slightly, checking to see if there's anyone else around that I could be referring to, and then turns toward me.

Rikka
「What is it?」
％Ｂ
「I've been wondering for a while now, but could you tell me your name?」

Rikka
「...」
She stares up at me with narrow eyes.
...I'm a little scared.
Rikka
「...Narusawa Rikka.」
She tersely states her name, and then just up and leaves, as if to indicate that there's nothing more to talk about.

all
％Ｂ
「Narusawa... Rikka. Okay.」
I didn't really get to talk to her, but I do know her name now.
Natsuki
「You put up a pretty good fight, transfer student!」
％Ｂ
「She only told me her name, though.」
Natsuki
「That's pretty good! Rikka's usually doing stuff alone. You'll blink, and she'll suddenly be gone.」

Natsuki
「I have almost no photos of her, thanks to that. It's kind of an issue...」

Natsuki
「She always gives short, cold responses when I try to talk to her, too. I'm two months ahead of you when it comes to trying to talk to her.」

％Ｂ
「Really. So she's that...」
Natsuki
「'Course, as a member of the grad-alb committee, I have to take photos of everyone equally.」

Natsuki
「And they might be short responses, but if she's responding at all, then that means that she's at least willing to communicate, right?」

％Ｂ
「You're way more optimistic than I am, Segawa.」
Natsuki
「But it's a real shame. She's so pretty. I'm sure she's cute when she smiles. I bet she'd be so popular～」


Natsuki
「Right? Don't you think?」
％Ｂ
「What are you asking me for?」
Natsuki
「I wanna get the opinion of the average male.」
％Ｂ
「Hmm～ ...Well, I guess she's pretty?」
Natsuki
「Whaaat? What kind of answer is that?」
％Ｂ
「I'm not gonna think anything more than that when I've barely talked to her.」
Natsuki
「Hmm. You're more principled than I figured.」
Natsuki
「But you know, it's great that someone like you transferred in.」

％Ｂ
「'Cause it's a good topic for the graduation album?」
Natsuki
「That too, but I was talking about Rikka.」
％Ｂ
「Narusawa-san?」
Natsuki
「You've seen how she is. I'm pretty much the only one who tries to talk to her.」

Natsuki
「Everyone's gotta have fun together at school, don't you think? I'm nosy and I want Rikka to be included in that too.」

Natsuki
「So that's why I want you to keep trying to talk to her. Though I bet she'll act annoyed about it.」

She shows me another frank smile.
Segawa's actually pretty conscientious about her friends.
Natsuki
「And if things go well, it's okay if you just make her yours too.」
％Ｂ
「...You should listen to the words coming out of your mouth.」
Natsuki
「Oh? Is Rikka not good enough?」
％Ｂ
「I'll start by becoming friends with her.」
Natsuki
「That's a good idea.」
all
Marika
「Thanks for waiting!」
Shinozaki comes running over while I'm talking to Segawa.

Marika
「Hahh, hahh... Sorry I'm late... Hahh... Class went late...」

％Ｂ
「Y-You okay?」
She's got her hands on her knees, panting. I'm worried her asthma might start up again.

Marika
「Phew... Yeah, I'm fine～」
She must've realized what I was thinking. She looks up and makes a point to smile at me.

Marika
「I'm really sorry that I'm late. Did you wait long?」
％Ｂ
「Not rea―」
Natsuki
「Noooope! We were just talking about random stuff anyway, so there's no need to worry!」

Marika
「Wha... O-Okay... Thanks?」
％Ｂ
「What are you saying that for, Segawa?」
Natsuki
「What? But it's not like we've actually been waiting that long.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, but...」
That's not what I'm talking about.
Marika
「Uh, um... You're Segawa-san... from class C?」
Natsuki
「Yup. Segawa Natsuki, of the grad-alb committee. Nice to meet you, Shinozaki-san.」

Marika
「Oh... Yes... It's very nice to meet you...」
Natsuki
「Oh, no need to be so formal now. We're in the same year. So can I call you Marika instead of Shinozaki-san?」

Marika
「S-Sure... Okay...」
Natsuki
「So now that the three of us are together, how about we go to the cafeteria?」
％Ｂ
「Wait, what? Aren't you waiting for someone too, Segawa?」

Natsuki
「Yeah. For Marika.」
％Ｂ
「Uh... Really, Shinozaki?」
Marika
「I don't know anything about...」
％Ｂ
「What's going on here, Segawa?」
Natsuki
「I was just thinking I wanted to eat lunch with the two of you.」
％Ｂ
「...Why so suddenly?」
Natsuki
「'Cause I want to frame the cutesy moment between two childhood friends who haven't seen each other in forever. Don't you think it'd be a great shot for the graduation album?」


％Ｂ
「The cutesy... What are you talking about? We're just gonna go eat lunch. Right, Shinozaki?」

Marika
「Uh... Y-Yeah... That's right～」
Natsuki
「I won't force you guys to let me come with, of course. If you two don't want anyone getting in the way of your time together, then I understand.」


％Ｂ
「Well I'm fine if Shinozaki's fine...」
Marika
「S-Same here... I never said you couldn't...」
Natsuki
「Okay, it's settled then! Let's get to the cafeteria. There won't be any seats if we take too long, you know. Come on, hurry hurry!」


A few minutes later──
The three of us are sitting on a bench in the courtyard.
Natsuki
「Oh well～ No seats～」
Marika
「I'm sorry. If only I could've been a little earlier...」

％Ｂ
「Don't worry about it. There'll be tons of chances to go to the cafeteria from now on.」

％Ｂ
「In fact, it feels pretty good eating bread outside.」
Natsuki
「Yeah, our school store's got plenty of bread. It's an all-out battle to buy some of them though, since they sell out instantly.」

％Ｂ
「There really were a lot of different kinds. Took me a while to decide.」

Marika
「What'd you buy?」
％Ｂ
「Curry bread, a sausage donut, and a vegetable tuna sandwich. My old school only had super stereotypical stuff like red bean bread or jam bread, so it was pretty boring.」


Natsuki
「C'mon, let's eat. We're keeping the school tour event waiting. Let's dig in!」


％Ｂ
「You're right. Let's eat.」
Marika
「Let's eat.」
all
We each open up the packaging and start eating.
％Ｂ
「...Is that melon bread you're eating?」
Natsuki
「Yep-yep. It's True Melon Bread, with a melon-flavored cream core.」
％Ｂ
「Now that's heresy. Melon bread should be judged solely based on the crisp patterns on the outside.」

Natsuki
「What are you talking about? It's ridiculous to say it's a melon just based on looks. It's melon bread only if it's got melon particles contributing to its flavor profile.」


Natsuki
「It's one of the school store's best sellers. It's especially popular among the girls.」
all
％Ｂ
「A hit with the girls, huh? So does that mean you've got one too, Shinozaki?」
Marika
「Umm... Ehehe. I do. Do you want to try it? It's good.」

all
She opens up her melon bread.
She pushes it out so it's halfway out of the packaging and holds it out to me.
％Ｂ
「I'll try some then, yeah.」
I bring my face closer and take a bite.
％Ｂ
「Ngh!? Wh-What was that for?」
Natsuki
「A girl holds out some bread and you eat it from her hand! This is a picturesque childhood-friends-or-lovers scene!」

％Ｂ
「L-Lovers...」
Now that she mentions it, we might've looked like awfully cutesy lovers just now.

「I should've taken the bread first before eating it. Sorry about that, Shinozaki.」

Marika
「No, I didn't really mind...」
Shinozaki's looking downward, bright red.
Looks like she's gotten weirdly conscious because of what Segawa said.
all
％Ｂ
「And man, you just take photos at any and all opportunities, don't you?」
Natsuki
「Well I am a member of the grad-alb committee!」
Man, she says that like it's her favorite excuse or something.
Natsuki
「But still, it's pretty crazy that the two of you got to see each other again like this after separating in elementary school. You ever feel like it's destiny?」


％Ｂ
「Why do you always try to steer the conversation toward that kinda stuff?」
Natsuki
「'Cause that's more fun.」
％Ｂ
「Besides, I might have some old friends here other than Shinozaki. It wouldn't really be destiny if that were the case, right?」

Natsuki
「So, does he, Marika?」
Marika
「Huh? ...Does he what?」
Natsuki
「Does he have old friends here at this school other than you?」

Marika
「Friends other than me... Umm... Oh, there's Nirasawa-kun.」

％Ｂ
「Nirasawa...?」
His face comes to mind instantly.
％Ｂ
「Nirasawa? You mean Nirasawa Shuuichi? Huh... He goes to this school?」

Marika
「Y-Yeah.」
％Ｂ
「Really... Shuuichi's here... I see, I see.」
I'm a little happy.
It's not just because I've learned I have more old friends here.
It's because Shuuichi's pretty special to me as a friend.
Natsuki
「Hey, Marika. Do you mean Nirasawa from the event committee?」
％Ｂ
「Event? What committee's that?」
Marika
「That's him. I'm pretty sure he's in the event committee.」
The event committee... There's another committee I've never heard of before.
This school's got a lot of weird committees.
Natsuki
「Hey, so what's your relationship with Nirasawa? I'm kiiinda getting a whiff of some springtime of youth stuff, you know? Oh, I don't mean that in a weird way, obviously.」


％Ｂ
「What would it even mean in a weird way?」
％Ｂ
「Shuuichi was in the same year as Shinozaki and me back in elementary school. Though we were never in the same class.」

％Ｂ
「I was in a local soccer club back then, and Shuuichi was one of my teammates.」

％Ｂ
「We were both forwards, and we went to the same school, so we became friends right away.」

％Ｂ
「But we both really hated losing, so we fought over stupid stuff all the time.」

％Ｂ
「We never actually stopped being friends or anything... It's weird. We'd always make up right away after fighting. Maybe it was 'cause we both respected each other.」


Natsuki
「So you mean... you guys were like rivals?」
％Ｂ
「Hmm... That's a cool way of saying it, but it's more like we just kinda had a hateful friendship...」

Marika
「You always said you'd play soccer together during lunch break.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, that's right. He'd always come play soccer with us, even though he was in another class.」

％Ｂ
「We even competed over how many goals we scored. I'm pretty sure it ended with 19 for me and 18 for him, so I was winning.」


％Ｂ
「I remember he was real pissed when he heard I was moving. He was like, "What, you're gonna run away when you're winning?"」

Natsuki
「I see. So Nirasawa loved you.」
％Ｂ
「No... How'd you reach that conclusion?」
Natsuki
「Okay! Let's go meet Nirasawa, then!」
％Ｂ
「Uh...」
Natsuki
「A moving reunion between two men who acknowledged each other as rivals! It'll be a shot befitting the graduation album!」

％Ｂ
「Uh... I don't really think it'll be that big of a scene...」
Natsuki
「You were gonna have Marika show you around after this anyway, right? We can just do it on the side. We already know where he is anyway. It's okay, right, Marika?」


Marika
「Um... Umm... I don't know...」
Natsuki
「Huh? Oh, did you not want anyone getting in the way of your time alone together? I totally understand if that's the case.」

Marika
「N-No, it's not! That's not why～」
Natsuki
「Then it's fine, right? Let's go then. Okay?」
Well, regardless of whether it'll be a moving reunion... I do want to see Shuuichi.\n\r

It's been seven years, after all.
％Ｂ
「Okay... Then let's go.」
Segawa's brought us to the meeting place for this event committee or whatever it is.

Natsuki
「Nirasawa's usually here during lunch break.」
％Ｂ
「...You seriously know everything about this school.」
Natsuki
「I guess I dooo. I do stuff with Nirasawa a lot, since he's in the event committee and I'm in the grad-alb committee.」


...So what is this event committee anyway?
I guess I can just ask Shuuichi about it later.
Natsuki
「Now, let's go in.」
all
Segawa throws the door open without even knocking.
Natsuki
「Nirasawa, you heeere?」
Shuuichi
「Aaaaaghh!?」
A frantic yell sounds out from inside the room.
There's someone desperately trying to catch himself from falling out of the chair he was apparently reading in.

Shuuichi
「Oh, it's you again, Segawa... Learn to knock already. What are you going to do if you barge in on something awkward?」

Natsuki
「I'll make sure it's a moment you'll never forget if I do.」
She brings her camera to bear and smirks.
Shuuichi
「As terrifying as ever... So what are you here for?」

Natsuki
「There's someone I want you to meet. Here. Seen this guy before?」
all
Segawa grabs my arm and forcefully drags me in front of Shuuichi.
Shuuichi
「Hm...? Hm... Hmmm?」
Shuuichi stares hard at me through his glasses.
Shuuichi
「Oh... Y-You're...
 Ryousuke

!?」
％Ｂ
「Y-Yeah... Been a while... Shuuichi.」
Shuuichi
「What are you doing here...? Wait a second, that's our uniform... Wait a second, you've come back!?」

％Ｂ
「Yeah. I just moved back last week. I'm gonna be going to the same school as you starting today.」

Shuuichi
「Seriously? ...You're really back... You're not lying, are you?」
％Ｂ
「No... I'm seriously back.」
Shuuichi
「Really... So it's you and me, again...」
Shuuichi extends his right hand toward me.
Shuuichi
「Welcome home
, Ryousuke

.」
％Ｂ
「...I'm home, Shuuichi.」
I firmly grip his hand for a handshake.
Natsuki
「Mhm, now that's a nice scene! I'll be taking that!」
Segawa's taking photos like no tomorrow.
Shinozaki's looking a bit emotional as she watches us shake hands in reunion.

We smile in embarrassment as we end the handshake.
Shuuichi
「I didn't think I'd get to see you again. How long's it been since you moved away, again?」
％Ｂ
「Seven years. It's good to see you're still the same as ever.」
Shuuichi
「You still playing soccer, then?」
％Ｂ
「No, I played up through middle school... 'cause I found something else I wanted to do. How about you?」


Shuuichi
「I injured myself a bit. I was feeling like I was at the limits of my natural talent anyway.」

％Ｂ
「Listen to you talk. If you're saying you've got no talent for it, then that just means that I'm garbage at it.」

Shuuichi
「No, you were above me in terms of talent. It's a shame you quit.」

Natsuki
「I heard from him earlier that the two of you used to play in the same soccer team.」

Shuuichi
「That's right. We were both forwards. He surprised me over and over and over with his precision. He'd always shoot exactly where he needed to, no matter where he was.」


％Ｂ
「Shuuichi was crazy good at dribbling the ball. He could run circles around even the older kids. His feet moved like magic.」


Shuuichi
「Magic? Now that's too much. Stop it, you're embarrassing me.」
％Ｂ
「I wanna say the same thing. Stop saying stuff that'll make me blush.」
Natsuki
「And I heard you played soccer together during lunch breaks at school too?」

Shuuichi
「We did. We competed over our goals. By the time he moved, I had 18 points and he had 17, so I was in the lead by one point.」


％Ｂ
「No... What are you saying? I had 19, and I was in the lead by one, right?」

Shuuichi
「Ahaha! You think I'd misremember? You had 17, I had 18. I win by one point.」

％Ｂ
「Now wait a second... I remember clearly. The last day we played, I got that 19th point with a hat trick. You were so pissed.」


Shuuichi
「The second point was an own goal where the ball bounced off a defender, and the third was clearly offside. Though we just kept playing, since we were just kids playing without a ref.」


％Ｂ
「Even if the second one was an own goal, and I'm not saying it was, that third one definitely wasn't offside. I know for sure.」


Shuuichi
「What are you talking about? If that were an official club match, it'd have been 100 percent offside.」

％Ｂ
「It wouldn't be 100 percent. Besides, it's not like you would've been able to see enough to make the call from where you were anyway.」

Shuuichi
「Oh no, I definitely saw! 120 percent offside.」

This jackass just increased it by twenty percent...
_00cutinBS
Natsuki
「Umm... Looks like your stories aren't lining up.」
_00cutinBS
Marika
「This isn't good...」
_00cutinBS
Natsuki
「What isn't good?」
_00cutinBS
Marika
「They usually get along, but I heard they'd immediately get into arguments about the smallest things... I heard so many times that they argued a lot...」


_00cutinBS
_00cutinBS
％Ｂ
「If you really saw it, then why didn't you just say so back then? Why would you only say that now?」

Shuuichi
「I let you have that because you were moving away. I'd have felt bad if I didn't let you win at the very end.」

Excuse me!?
％Ｂ
「You'd have felt bad? I'd say I was the one who felt bad for you.」

％Ｂ
「You only played with us 'cause we had a bunch of rank amateur defenders, right? You could be all smug about getting past them with that garbage dribble of yours that way.」


Shuuichi
「Lo...Look who's talking. I remember you ripped off some famous player's celebration every time you scored a goal. Now that was cringey.」


％Ｂ
「Hnh...!」
Natsuki
「It's just like you said, Marika. It's only getting more heated.」
Marika
「H-Hey... You two, no fighting, okay～?」
％Ｂ
「Don't worry, Shinozaki. We're not fighting.」
Shuuichi
「That's right. We're just reminiscing over good times.」
Marika
「It doesn't really sound that way...」
Natsuki
「You two got along well before, right? You were rivals who approved of each other, right?」

％Ｂ
「We weren't rivals. I told you, it was just a hateful friendship.」
Shuuichi
「Yeah, that's right. I can't believe you came back here, after I thought I had finally seen the last of you. Hateful's the only way to describe it.」


％Ｂ
「O-Oh, is that so... So you're saying that you were acting when you were chasing after the moving van, bawling your eyes out?」

Shuuichi
「O-Of course it was... What kinda idiot would cry about you? By the way, that Messias autograph I gave you as a farewell gift was actually just a fake that I made.」


％Ｂ
「Wha...!?」
N-No way, right...!?
I thought that autograph was the real deal! It's framed on my wall right now...
％Ｂ
「O-Of course I knew it was a fake. I accepted it 'cause you were so insistent on giving it to me. I don't even know where the hell that thing is.」


Shuuichi
「Y-You lost it!? That Messias autograph!? Seriously!?」

％Ｂ
「Y-Yeah... Haven't seen it in seven years, come to think of it.」
Shuuichi
「Wh-Why, you... Do you even know how much trouble I went through to get that autograph!?」

％Ｂ
「So it's freakin' real, then!」
Natsuki
「What the heck... This is more like they're just two kids arguing than them being rivals.」

Marika
「Maybe we shouldn't have let them meet... Nothing's changed from how I heard they used to be...」

Shuuichi
「That's right, it's just like Shinozaki says. He hasn't grown at all. This guy's just as much of an idiot as ever!」

％Ｂ
「Right back at you. You just love to show off, just like back when you were a snot-nosed kid.」


Shuuichi
「The hell did you say?」
％Ｂ
「You wanna go?」
Marika
「L-Let's stop, you two～ You shouldn't fight about something silly like this when you've only just met again...」


Shuuichi
「No, it's not silly.」
％Ｂ
「Our pride as men is on the line here.」
Marika
「Auuuh...」
Natsuki
「Hm. This should probably be settled for sure with a contest of some kind.」
％Ｂ
「A contest?」
all
Natsuki
「Men should smash aside the competition with force! It'll be a head-on fight with your pride on the line!」

Marika
「W-Wait, Segawa-san!?」
all
％Ｂ
「A head-on fight with our pride on the line...」
Shuuichi
「Hmph... Sounds interesting. I'm up for that, Segawa. That is, if my opponent doesn't go running home scared.」


％Ｂ
「Hah. I should say the same for you. How about you apologize now while you still can, before you embarrass yourself?」

Shuuichi
「The hell did you say!?」
％Ｂ
「You wanna go!?」
all
Marika
「Wawah... I-Is this really going to be okay?」
Natsuki
「I'm sure it'll be fine. C'mon, you two idiots, come outside. I'll prepare the stage for you.」


％Ｂ
「...Looks like the time's finally come to settle things.」
Shuuichi
「Yeah... I'll close the curtain on my time with you. With my victory!」

Natsuki
「The two of you were both soccer players. Which means that the contest is, of course, a penalty kick shootout!」

Natsuki
「It'll be a first to five... if we were going for a little-league match. We're gonna go with an immediate sudden death!」

％Ｂ
「So we both take turns shooting, and whoever misses first when the other scores loses.」
Shuuichi
「Penalty kicks are all about mental fortitude. It'll be the perfect stage for a fight between men.」

％Ｂ
「...Now that I think about it, I remember you missed penalty kicks a lot. You'd kick way over the bar, like you were trying to get the ball into space.」


Shuuichi
「Sh-Shut up! You've had shots blocked by the goalkeeper before!」

％Ｂ
「I still shot the ball into the bounds of the goal. You should be praising those keepers for managing to block those instead.」

Natsuki
「Yeah, yeah. I already told you no more arguing. We're gonna start this already! Who's going first?」

all
Shuuichi
「I'll start. This first shot's gonna sing his requiem!」
％Ｂ
「Hmph! I'd like to see you try!」
Natsuki
「Oh, just so you know. There's going to be a penalty game for the loser.」
Shuuichi
「Wait a second! What!? You never said anything about that!」
Natsuki
「It's a given in a man's fight with pride on the line. How about the loser plays gofer for the winner for a day?」

％Ｂ
「S-So that's how it's gonna go... I'm in. A fight's gotta have risks.」

Shuuichi
「H-Hmph... Fine, then. You better be prepared. I'm gonna use you until you collapse once I win.」

Marika
「Things have gotten way out of hand～」
Natsuki
「Don't just sit there muttering, Marika. Who are you gonna cheer for?」
Marika
「I guess... 
Hino-kun...
％Ａ-kun...
」
Natsuki
「So I guess that's because you──」
Marika
「Because we're childhood friends!」
all
_00cutinBS
Shuuichi places the ball down at the penalty mark and slowly walks back.

I jump up and down a few times to loosen myself up, and then crouch down, ready.

_00cutinBS
Shuuichi
「Here goes...!」
％Ｂ
「Come at me!」
I'll definitely block it!
_00cutinBS
Shuuichi's right-footed. His shots usually come in toward the keeper's left.

Shuuichi
「Take this!」
Yes! It's to the left!
I leap to the left. But―

％Ｂ
「What the―!?」
efryusen
efryusen
Shuuichi
「Goaaaaaal!」
％Ｂ
「Kh!?」
Shuuichi
「Hahahah! Take that
, Ryousuke

! 
You can't stop my shot!」
all
My prediction was off... I thought it was going to the left, but the ball went flying into the complete other side―


...Wait a second.
％Ｂ
「Hey... What the heck?」
It's not the ball that flew in, but...
％Ｂ
「Hey! This is your shoe!」
It's the leather shoe that he had been wearing on his right foot.
Shuuichi
「Wh-What...?」
all
The ball's sitting there motionless at Shuuichi's feet.
Natsuki
「That's crazy lame... But it was pretty hilarious to watch, so it's all good!」

Marika
「You did it! Great job!」
all
It doesn't make me happy to hear you praise what happened just now, Shinozaki...
Shuuichi
「A-Anyway, it's time to switch!」
I switch places with Shuuichi. I'm up to kick now.
I place the ball down and take a few steps back.
all
％Ｂ
「Phew...」
It's been so long since I've even kicked a ball.
I'm a bit nervous.
Though I guess I'm not too anxious, since he's already missed.
％Ｂ
「Let's see...」
Where do I kick? Left, or right...
Which should I pick...
Shuuichi
「C-Come at me!」
I guess it's still the first shot, so I might as well just kick it as hard as I can!
efryusen
efryusen
efryusen
efryusen
％Ｂ
「Go!」
％Ｂ
「Agh!?」
efryusen
efryusen
What have I done!?
I kicked the ball as hard as I could, and it ricocheted off the post.
Shuuichi
「All right! You see that!? That's how good I am!」
％Ｂ
「...I clearly just missed.」
all
But still... it didn't feel too bad kicking the ball just now.
It was kinda nostalgic. I can't help but smile from how good I feel.

Natsuki
「He missed, but he's smiling...?」
Marika
「You'll lose if you're not serious～」
％Ｂ
「Yeah... I know, Shinozaki. That just now was pretty much practice. I'll get it in for sure next time!」

all
Shuuichi
「Hmph... Well don't you look pleased with yourself. But now the match is over for you!」
For Shuuichi's second shot―
Natsuki
「Oh. There's the space launch shot.」
Shuuichi
「Nooooooooo!?」
The ball goes flying way over the bar.
％Ｂ
「...You're seriously exactly the same as you were back then.」
Shuuichi
「Sh-Shut up! I'm just not doing so great today! I'll get it for sure next time!」

Next time? ...But it'll be the end if I get it in this time... He knows that, right?

all
I take a few steps back and take deep breaths.
This time, I temper my force and... aim for the right side of the goal!

％Ｂ
「This time for sure!」

Shuuichi
「Guah!?」
all
Marika
「Kyah!?」
By some crazy coincidence, Shuuichi leapt to the right too. He blocked the shot with his face.


％Ｂ
「You're kidding me... H-Hey, you all right?」
Natsuki
「That's gotta hurt... but it was great to watch!」
Shuuichi
「Ha, hahahah... Y-You see that!? You see how good I am!?」
Shuuichi looks pretty happy, despite the nosebleed.
％Ｂ
「R-Right... Yeah man, that one we can say was all you...」
Let's just say that... I feel kinda sorry for him.
Shuuichi
「A-All right... This time for sure, fgah... I'll get it in, and end this match...」
Natsuki
「Oh man, I just can't watch this anymore! Marika, hold my camera for a bit.」
Marika
「O-Okay... Sure.」
Natsuki
「Here, give me the ball!」
Shuuichi
「Wha... H-Hey, Segawa?」
all
Segawa hands Shinozaki her camera and wrests the ball from Shuuichi's hands.
Natsuki
「Proxy kicker, Segawa Natsukiii!」
％Ｂ
「Excuse me?」
Shuuichi
「W-Wait a second! Proxy kicker!? What's that supposed to mean!? This is a match between just him and me, with our pride on the line! We don't need some girl crashing it!」


Natsuki
「How about you say that after your nose stops bleeding? You look ridiculous.」
Shuuichi
「Uuugh...」
Natsuki
「Nirasawa's being taken out 'cause of his injuries. I'll take it over from here.」
％Ｂ
「Whoa, wait... You serious?」
Why do I have to do this against Segawa?
And wait, does she play soccer too?
Marika
「Segawa-san, did you use to play soccer?」
Natsuki
「Not one bit. I've never even kicked a ball before in my life.」
Shuuichi
「Wha... Then why'd you switch with me!?」
Natsuki
「Weeell, I just didn't feel you'd ever score. And I feel sorry for you being all alone when Marika's cheering him on. So I'll kick for you instead of cheering.」


Natsuki
「So anyway, I'm kicking next! That's fine, right?」
％Ｂ
「Well if you really want to, sure... but I don't really know how I'd feel if I just won against an amateur.」

Natsuki
「Well aren't you confident. Then I'm sure you wouldn't mind if we just said it was my win if I make a goal right now, would you?」

％Ｂ
「Uhh... W-Well, sure, fine by me. We can say it's Shuuichi's win if you manage to score a goal on me.」

Natsuki
「It's decided then! A man doesn't take his words back, you hear!?」
Marika
「H-Hey... You sure it's okay to say that?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah... I might not be a keeper, but I can stop an amateur's shot pretty much on reflex... probably.」


Natsuki
「Fufun, just keep on talking like that. I'm sure you'll crumple to the ground once you see my shot.」


％Ｂ
「Sure! I'd like to see you try!」
Shuuichi
「Hmph. As if Segawa'd be able to pull it off when even I couldn't!」

...Whose side is he even on?
Natsuki
「Uhh... Like this, right?」
all
She places the ball down, takes a few steps back, lets her arms dangle at her sides, and takes a deep breath in a wide stance.

％Ｂ
「It's almost like she's R. Christiano...」
She's got the look going, but she's still an amateur.
An amateur's shot usually goes flying in the direction of the pivoting foot's toe.

Natsuki
「Here I go!」
％Ｂ
「Yeah! Come!」
all
Is it the right?
Natsuki
「Take thiiis!!」
Or the left?
efryusen
efryusen
％Ｂ
「Wha...!?」
An instant later, I see something other than the ball...
Segawa kicked upward, and I could see―
_00cutinBS
none

「Pink...!?」
Underwear!?

Natsuki
「Goaaaaaaaaaaaaal!」
She yells loud and proud, pointing her finger up toward the sky.
all
Marika
「Wow! You're amazing, Segawa-san!」
Shuuichi
「You're kidding me!」
all
I slowly crumple to the ground.
％Ｂ
「Kh...」
I couldn't move a muscle...
It was just too...
That's right... That pink underwear was just too blinding...
Natsuki
「Ahahahahah! You see that!?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah... I saw... You really showed me...」
％Ｂ
「It's my loss, Segawa...」
And... thank you.
The bell rings, as if to mock me and Shuuichi hanging our heads.
I... didn't get to tour the school.
Natsuki
「Now then... Oh? What are you doing? Not going home?」
％Ｂ
「I'm waiting for Shinozaki. I told her we'd go home together. I figured I'd wait here, since she said she had something to do for a bit after school.」

Natsuki
「My, my. Aren't you two close.」
％Ｂ
「Thanks to you... 
By the way, what's with the getup?」
She's got an armband that says "Approved Photography" and a camera bag around her waist. She definitely doesn't look like she's about to go home.

Natsuki
「Mmmfufuuu.」
Natsuki
「I've got grad-alb committee duties starting now. After school times are a treasure hoard for documenting the springtime of youth.」

％Ｂ
「I get it, so that's the grad-alb committee's uniform. What are you gonna take pictures of?」

Natsuki
「School life in motion!」
％Ｂ
「...I-I see.」
What forceful words...
Natsuki
「Anyway, I'll be going. See you tomorrow!」
％Ｂ
「Y-Yeah... Later.」
all
％Ｂ
「Now then...」
Shinozaki said she'd call me once she was done.
％Ｂ
「Guess I'll just wander around while I wait.」
％Ｂ
「Hm...?」
I spot a familiar silhouette before me in the hallway.

％Ｂ
「That's...」
A small girl wearing a hood over her head.
She's walking while carrying a big hard case in both hands.
There's no doubt. It's her.
％Ｂ
「Yo.」
I walk up to her from behind and greet her.
She turns around. She's not wearing those sunglasses this time.
？？？／そら
「...Oh.」
％Ｂ
「Looks like we meet again.」
？？？／そら
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「I realized I never told you my name. I'm ％Ａ ％Ｂ. I transferred here starting today. I'm in class 2-C. Nice to meet you.」


？？？／そら
「...Nice to meet you...
 Ryou

.」
Uh... She's calling me that right off the bat?
Well, it's not like I mind...
？？？／そら
「...Class 1-B... Ousaka Sora.」
％Ｂ
「Sora? Huh. That's a nice name.」
Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「You about to go up to the roof?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「Oh, then you mind if I come with? I like that place. Feels nice up there.」

Sora
「...There's no issue.」
She repositions the telescope's case in her arms.
...Looks heavy.
Hold the telescope for her.
Try not to get in her way.
％Ｂ
「Here, I'll hold the telescope for you.」
all
I take the case from her.
It really is heavy.
％Ｂ
「I'm surprised you carry this thing up there every day.」
But she's holding it so preciously. Maybe I shouldn't try to do anything unnecessary.

It's probably delicate. I'm sure you have to be careful with it.
％Ｂ
「You always carry that telescope around yourself?」
Sora
「...Because I'm the astronomy club president.」
％Ｂ
「What? President? Even though you're a first year?」
Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「But then maybe you should let another club member handle it, then? Like a guy.」

Sora
「...Can't.」
％Ｂ
「Can't...? Why not? Do you not have any guys in the club?」
Sora
「...No.」
Sora
「...I'm the only member.」
％Ｂ
「R-Really...?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「Really... But can you really be in a club just by yourself? Don't clubs usually have some minimum number of people you need?」


Sora
「...Even one person can form a club at this school. There are other clubs like that, and there's a committee that helps with activities too.」


％Ｂ
「Huh... That's a pretty generous committee.」
Though I guess there'd have to be one like that for one person to form a club.
I can feel the same pleasant wind from the day before yesterday as soon as we open the door.
％Ｂ
「Mmm... Yeah, this place is great.」
Ousaka immediately pulls her hood down, opens the case, and starts setting up the telescope.\n\r

She's attaching something to the eyepiece.
％Ｂ
「You gonna look at the moon again?」
Sora
「...This today.」
％Ｂ
「This?」
all
The telescope's pretty much pointing horizontally instead of up at the sky.
Ousaka points at the eyepiece once she's done setting up.
I guess she's saying I should look through it again.

％Ｂ
「Hmm...」
all
I peer in to see the glimmering deep blue sea.

％Ｂ
「Ohh! It's the ocean!」
I pull my eye away for a second and take a look toward where the telescope's pointing.

Yeah. I can see the ocean even from here.
But it's really far away.
％Ｂ
「It's so close! It's crazy close, even though it's so far!」
Sora
「...」
Ousaka looks perplexed for a moment. I'm so excited I don't really even know what I'm saying myself at this point.

％Ｂ
「You're kidding me... What the heck, this is awesome!」
I was impressed at getting to see the bumps on the moon the other day too, but this is almost like looking at another world. It's like I'm looking at a painting.


But compared to the moon, the sea's way closer. There's a sense of realness.
I feel like I've been taken so much closer.
％Ｂ
「How much bigger can you make things in this?」
I ask Ousaka as I watch the sea from up close.
Sora
「...Five hundred times maximum.」
％Ｂ
「Five hundred times... Astronomy telescopes are awesome...」
Sora
「...It can also do this.」
$$smh_OpenCHK
She retrieves a small remote from inside the case.
Sora
「...You can use this remote to move wherever you want in the visual field, and adjust the magnification.」

％Ｂ
「Wow, it can even do stuff like that? But why wouldn't you just do it manually?」

Sora
「...Earth rotates. It's hard to make precise adjustments by hand while looking through. The visual field moves, and you lose sight of the stars.」


％Ｂ
「Oh, that makes sense. So you can use the remote to adjust while you're still looking through.」

Sora
「...Wanna try?」
％Ｂ
「Oh, for sure. Let me try.」
I accept the remote and manipulate it while looking through the eyepiece.
The field of view moves bit by bit, and the magnification changes.
％Ｂ
「I see... Yeah, I could see how this would be useful.」
I move the field of view laterally while looking at the ocean.
It's still too early to see a lot of beachgoers, but I do see a few surfers riding the waves.

$$smh_OpenCHK
％Ｂ
「Oh man, I could do this all day.」
Sora
「...」
I pull my eye away and look at Ousaka. She looks a little proud.

％Ｂ
「But why the ocean today?」
Sora
「...To relax.」
％Ｂ
「...Okay.」
I guess she just does things at her own pace.
％Ｂ
「Still, astronomy telescopes are lots of fun. I want one now. I could get a good luck at anything with one of these―」

Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「Uh... I didn't mean that in a bad way, okay? Uhh, you know... I was talking about seeing places you can't really get too close to...」

Sora
「...」
...I feel like she's misunderstood something about what I said.
Sora
「...I look at places I can't get close to sometimes.」
％Ｂ
「R-Right? That's what I'm talking about!」
Sora
「...」
all
Ousaka approaches the telescope with a bit of a mysterious expression, and adjusts its angle again.

She fine-tunes it with the remote, and then points at the eyepiece again.

％Ｂ
「S-Sure...」
What's she showing me now?
all
％Ｂ
「...A classroom?」
It's a classroom somewhere in this school.
There are curtains waving in the wind in front of an open window.
There are glass containers lined up on top of a big table.
％Ｂ
「...What's that?」
I use the remote to slowly raise the magnification.
There's something half transparent inside the containers.
％Ｂ
「They're moving... Are those animals?」
I further increase the magnification. I can clearly see the half-transparent things moving around inside the containers.

％Ｂ
「What's up with those mysterious organisms?」
Sora
「...That's the second chemistry classroom. The naturalist club is using it right now.」
$$smh_OpenCHK
％Ｂ
「The naturalist club?」
Sora
「...They're running suspicious top-secret experiments involving mysterious organisms.」
％Ｂ
「T-Top secret... Seriously?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
Sora
「It's just a rumor. But...」
％Ｂ
「Y-Yeah... It definitely looks like that's what they're doing.」
The second chemistry classroom, after school.
The naturalist club that uses it.
Mysterious organisms being raised in glass containers...
It's more like somewhere I don't wanna get close to, instead of somewhere I can't get close to.
Now what'd complete the scene is if a researcher or something were prowling around―
％Ｂ
「Whoa, you're kidding...」
And right on cue, someone walks into the field of view.
I can't really see her face, but it looks like she's wearing this school's uniform.
％Ｂ
「It's a girl from our school?」
I try to manipulate the remote so I can see her face, but then―

She suddenly looks up and stares back at me.
Sora
「...Hide.」
％Ｂ
「...!?」
$$smh_OpenCHK
I hastily pull away from the eyepiece and crouch down with Ousaka.

％Ｂ
「...Did she see us?」
Sora
「...I don't know.」
Ousaka stands up warily and checks the classroom.
Sora
「...Not there... I don't think they saw us...」
％Ｂ
「R-Really... That's good, then...」
％Ｂ
「Wha...!?」
My heart stops when my phone suddenly rings.
Should've put it on silent...
I pull my phone out and answer the phone.

「H-Hello?」
Marika
『Oh... It's me. Sorry it took so long.』
％Ｂ
「H-Hey... Shinozaki...」
Marika
『I just finished what I was asked to do, so I can go home. Where are you?』
％Ｂ
「Right now, I'm... up on the roof?」
Marika
『...The roof? You can go up there?』
％Ｂ
「It's a long story. I need to go back to my classroom to get my stuff, so let's meet up at the gates.」


Marika
『Okay, got it. I'll see you in a bit, then.』
％Ｂ
「Yeah... Later.」
_smh_st_04
$$smh_OpenCHK
％Ｂ
「Sorry, Ousaka. I've gotta go meet up with someone, so I'm gonna go.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「Let me look through the telescope again sometime. Later.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
all
I glance back at Ousaka right before I start downstairs.
She's pointing the telescope somewhere else again.
She really just does her own thing, huh...
Shinozaki's fidgeting in front of the school gates.
％Ｂ
「Sorry, my bad! You must've been waiting for a while.」
Shinozaki immediately smiles when she sees me running over.
Marika
「No, it wasn't that long. Did something happen to you?」

％Ｂ
「I ran into someone I know while I was taking a look around the school. Lost track of time while we were talking. Sorry about that.」

Marika
「Someone you know? Like a new friend you made since coming here? You never change.」

％Ｂ
「Huh? What do you mean?」
Marika
「Because you always make friends with anyone right away. You've always been that way.」

％Ｂ
「Have I?」
Marika
「You haaave～ I was so jealous of that part of you, you know.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, you were an introvert back then.」
Marika
「Yeah. I don't think I've changed at all either～」
％Ｂ
「What are you talking about? You've changed way more than I have.」
She looks shocked when I say that.
Marika
「Huh? Me? I haven't changed at all.」

％Ｂ
「That's not true. You've changed like crazy. Look how much healthier you are now.」

％Ｂ
「And now you're saying you'll show me around town. Don't you think you've come a long way?」

Marika
「Showing you around isn't that big of a deal～ I've just lived here for a long time.」

％Ｂ
「So I've got a question for the Shionagi expert, then. Where do you hang out after school?」

Marika
「I wouldn't say I'm an expert... but I probably mostly go downtown when I want to have fun. It's closer than you'd think, and there are lots of shops.」


％Ｂ
「I see. Wanna go now, then?」

Marika
「Huh? Now? I think now wouldn't be good, since we're wearing our uniforms～ We're supposed to go straight home after school...」


％Ｂ
「Is our school that strict?」
Marika
「Yeah, it's written in the student handbook. Though I don't think anyone actually follows that rule...」

％Ｂ
「Oh, then it doesn't matter, does it?」
Marika
「B-But rules are rules...」
％Ｂ
「That's so like you, Shinozaki. Maybe you haven't changed that much.」

Marika
「R-Riiight～? M-Mmmh...」
％Ｂ
「Why not? We could be bad every now and then.」

Marika
「But I'll need to let my mom know if I'm coming home late... What should I do～?」

She falls into deep thought.
I can't believe she's this conflicted over going somewhere after school. She's just as pure as ever.

I'm starting to feel kinda bad.
％Ｂ
「I guess we don't have to today. We can just go during the weekend or something.」

Marika
「Y-Yeah... I'm sorry.」
％Ｂ
「Don't make that face. I don't care about when I go, I care about who's there with me. It'll always be fun with you, Shinozaki.」


Marika
「Huh? You... think so?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. Of course.」
Shinozaki falls into silent thought again for some reason in response to my proclamation.
Marika
「...Okay. Let's go now.」

％Ｂ
「Huh? But... we're still in uniform. And you've gotta let your mom know too, right?」

Marika
「I'll tell her. Besides... I didn't really want to go home yet either.」

Marika
「I'm different from how I was when I was small. That's what you said, right?」

％Ｂ
「All right! Let's go, then!」
％Ｂ
「Wow～ This place really comes alive around now.」
Marika
「The shopping mall stole a lot of the customers for a while, but it's gotten lively again after it just recently got renovated.」


％Ｂ
「Things changed a lot while I was gone.」
I didn't get to look around much when I was here before...
But there are lots of classy restaurants and brand-products shops here.\n\r
And a few old-looking stores mixed in too. It's got a nice feel to it.
Marika
「Oh, look. It's Edamame Daifuku, our regional specialty shop. Do you remember this place? It's still in business.」


％Ｂ
「Oh yeah, I sure do! Man, I'm glad to see there are still shops I remember.」

My memories come roaring back, triggered by the nostalgic sight.

％Ｂ
「Now that I think of it, Tanabata's coming up next month, isn't it?」
Memories of fun festival scenes come bubbling up in my mind.
Marika
「Tanabata Festival's still far away. It's in August.」

％Ｂ
「August? Why? Tanabata's July 7th, isn't it?」

Marika
「Geez, you're such a Tokyoite now. Shionagi celebrates Tanabata from the traditional Japanese calendar. That's why it's celebrated in August.」


％Ｂ
「I lived in Kanagawa... Plus, I'm from this city. And what? Traditional Japanese calendar?」

Looks like my memories are pretty foggy from how long it's been.
But I can still clearly remember the sights of the Tanabata Festival.
％Ｂ
「It's a huge festival, right?」
Marika
「Yeah. They put up pennants and bamboo decorations all over this market too. There are lots of stalls and lots of events. I think... it might be the most fun time of year.」


Marika
「Shionagi First Academy does a Tanabata Festival too.」
％Ｂ
「Ohh, now that sounds fun.」
Marika
「Let's make lots of good memories together again.」
Shinozaki shows me a smile from the bottom of her heart.
％Ｂ
「Yeah. For sure.」
I wonder what this summer's gonna be like.
I'm starting to get really excited.
And then Shinozaki's phone rings.
Looks like she has mail or something.
Marika
「Oh, it's from my mom.」
％Ｂ
「Your mom? What's she say? Is she telling you to hurry up and come home?」

Marika
「N-No, that's not what she said... "Having fun 
with Hino-kun?
together?
"」
Shinozaki looks a little embarrassed looking at her screen.
I thought it was mail she got, but it doesn't seem like that's the case.
％Ｂ
「Is that "LIME Talk"?」
Marika
「Yeah, it is. My mom and I always send messages this way, since it doesn't cost any money.」

I know it's popular right now, but I haven't installed it myself yet.
I didn't think that even Shinozaki would be using it.
I'd have figured she'd be slow to pick up stuff like this.
％Ｂ
「Maybe I should install it if you're using it too.」
Marika
「Oh, you don't have it yet? You should～ We all talk to each other this way.」


％Ｂ
「All right, then I'll do it. Could you show me how?」

Marika
「Yeah, of course. Though it's not that complicated anyway.」

all
Shinozaki walks me through installing and setting up LIME.

It's done in a snap.
Marika
「There we go. I put in my address too.」

％Ｂ
「Great. Thanks.」
％Ｂ
「Oh?」
My phone rings. It's a LIME message already.

【Marika】「Let's talk a lot!」
【Marika】_st_0103
Her message is simple and reserved.
【％Ｂ】「Yeah, let's do it!!」
【％Ｂ】_st_0314
I add a stamp and send my reply.
This looks pretty fun.
all
％Ｂ
「Hmm, I see. So you can do stuff like this too.」

I'm starting to figure out this LIME stuff from messing around.
％Ｂ
「Oh, a message.」
Which means it must be Shinozaki. Obviously. She's the only one I have registered.

【Marika】「Good evening.」
【Marika】_st_0104
【％Ｂ】「Hey! Evening!」
【Marika】「Looks like you're used to using this already.」
【％Ｂ】「Getting the hang of it. #NThanks a bunch.」
【Marika】「I'm glad～ I was worried.」
【％Ｂ】「Easy peasy!」
【％Ｂ】_st_0301
【Marika】「I knew it'd be for you～」
【Marika】_st_0109
％Ｂ
「This is pretty great.」
It gets more and more fun as I go.
I can see why everyone's so into this.
【％Ｂ】「You mind if we talk for a while? Until I'm used to #Nthis.」
【Marika】「It's totally fine with me～I'll be here until you #Nfigure it out.」
【Marika】「By the way, are you going to join any clubs? Like #Nsoccer?」
【％Ｂ】「I retired from playing #Nsoccer back in middle #Nschool, actually...」
【Marika】「What? Why?」
【％Ｂ】「There was some part-time #Nwork I wanted to do. I #Nwas busy with that.」
【％Ｂ】「I tried to get the same #Nkinda work over here too,#Nbut I failed the #Ninterview.」
【Marika】「Really... Where's that?」
【％Ｂ】「Azuma Morio's #Narchitectural firm.」
【Marika】「Is he famous?」
【％Ｂ】「Oh, come on. He's the #Nmost famous architect #Nin Shionagi.」
【％Ｂ】「Here, what if I said he #Ndesigned the Marinpia #NShionagi building?」
【Marika】「Oh...! That aquarium's so cool!」
【Marika】「Though it closed down.」
％Ｂ
「Whaaaaaaaaaaaat!?」
I yell out loud without thinking.
That aquarium closed down? You're kidding...
【％Ｂ】「Seriously?」
【Marika】「Yeah. It wasn't doing wellfor a long time... It #Nclosed down in May.」
【％Ｂ】「What about the building!? They didn't tear it down, did they!?」
【Marika】「No, they didn't... #Nprobably. I think.」
％Ｂ
「Phew... No, I shouldn't just be relieved about that. I was definitely going to go now that I came back...」

I wanna at least look at the outside one more time.
I hope it's still there like it used to be.
Please! Be there!
