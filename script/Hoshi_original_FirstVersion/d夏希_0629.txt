Sunday─
The sunlight feels a little hotter than usual.
There aren't many clouds in the sky, and the air feels clear.
And my heart is quietly dancing.
A date...
A date, with my girlfriend...
I've heard that just waiting becomes fun, and that turns out to be correct.
％Ｂ
「...」
Natsuki
「Sorryyy!」
Segawa arrives to our meet-up spot.
Natsuki
「I'm sorry I'm late! I'll be honest, I overslept! I'm so sorry!」

％Ｂ
「No, you don't need to apologize. It's still half an hour before when we're supposed to meet up...」

I got here an hour early.
It was just in case, after Segawa did the same a week ago when we went to the beach...

％Ｂ
「Looks like there wasn't any point to our meet-up time again, huh.」
Natsuki
「I'm just so bad at this. I always wake up early when there's an event because I'm so excited.」

％Ｂ
「So if you overslept, then does that mean you weren't really looking forward to today?」

Natsuki
「Of course I was! Don't be mean like that. I was so excited I've barely gotten any sleep since Friday.」


％Ｂ
「Since Friday... You've been up for two days straight!?」
Natsuki
「No, I finally passed out at around dawn today. That's why I overslept, though.」

％Ｂ
「So you're half an hour early even after oversleeping... You're way too excited.」

Natsuki
「I can't help it. It's a... d-date... with you... It'd be impossible not to be excited.」


Natsuki
「And what about you, then? You weren't looking forward to our date today?」

％Ｂ
「Actually, I was so excited I woke up at 5 a.m.」
Natsuki
「Ahaha, what the heck, you're the same as me.」
％Ｂ
「Looks like it. Guess we're both the same. All right, let's get going.」

Natsuki
「Yeah!」
The theme for the photo exhibition is "lovers."
Which might be why there are so many couples here.
I see young couples like us, families with kids, and elderly married couples too.

There are some people here alone too of course, but the couples stand out more.

％Ｂ
「...」
Natsuki
「...」
The photos on display all follow the theme of lovers.
There's a photo of a field of flowers, with two flowers of a different color from the rest growing next to each other.
Two birds flying side by side.
A pair of leaves floating down a pretty brook.
％Ｂ
「I get it... So they're likening objects and animals to lovers.」

Natsuki
「Yeah... It's just an overall theme, so you can show things directly, or you can invoke the theme through linked concepts.」

A red toothbrush and a blue toothbrush inside a cup on a sink.
A man's shirt and a woman's shirt hanging on a drying rod under a blue sky.
Two sets of coffee cups placed beside a single bed.
％Ｂ
「I like the ones that invoke the theme indirectly. It's fun imagining lots of stuff.」

Natsuki
「That's true. I like them too. But I think I personally prefer the more direct photos...」


A little boy and girl casually holding hands.
A silhouette of a man and woman embracing, placing their foreheads together.
And... lovers exchanging a passionate kiss.
％Ｂ
「...They're real direct.」
Natsuki
「Yeah... but I like these kinds of photos that capture a "moment."」
％Ｂ
「A moment...」
Now that I think about it, I feel like a lot of Segawa's photos capture moments in the same way.

Natsuki
「By the way, I heard from Marika. You want to be an architect, right?」

％Ｂ
「Yeah... What about it?」
Natsuki
「That might be why you like the photos where you take your time and imagine lots of stuff.」

％Ｂ
「...What do you mean?」
Natsuki
「Architecture's something that's always there in front of you, right? Buildings quietly symbolize things. I think you like photos that are along the same lines because you're already involved with stuff like that.」


％Ｂ
「Aah, I see what you mean...」
Segawa's always amazing when it comes to photos...
She's so serious, so direct...
Natsuki
「I like these photos of moments. Of movement. I guess it's the opposite of what you like.」

％Ｂ
「Our tastes are opposite, huh. I like that.」
Natsuki
「Huh? Why?」
％Ｂ
「Mmm... We complement each other that way?」
％Ｂ
「It might be easier if our tastes were the same, but I think that might just make it easier to think we understand each other when we really don't.」

％Ｂ
「But I think accepting a different viewpoint is how you really understand someone.」

Natsuki
「...You actually have a pretty good way of thinking.」
％Ｂ
「What's the "actually" for?」
Natsuki
「Oh, I appreciate it, though. Like, it's really positive, or more like you have your own personal way of thinking.」

％Ｂ
「Really? Never really thought about it myself.」
Natsuki
「I think it's probably because you have the clear-cut dream of becoming an architect.」

％Ｂ
「You've got your own dream of becoming a cameraman too, don't you?」
Natsuki
「Yeah... Wait. Are we actually pretty similar because we have artistic thought processes?」
％Ｂ
「That means we'll be able to synergize and understand each other even better.」
Natsuki
「Pff, aren't you saying the opposite of what you said earlier?」
％Ｂ
「I'm an optimist, so anything goes.」
She smiles at my answer.
Natsuki
「I ended up dragging you along for what I wanted to do, but were you bored?」

％Ｂ
「Not one bit! It was really easy to understand, and I seriously had fun. I'm glad I went.」

Natsuki
「Really? I'm glad you liked it.」
％Ｂ
「But do photo exhibitions always have that many couples come?」
Natsuki
「No... I think it's probably because of the theme for this one. Usually there's a lot more people who come by themselves.」

％Ｂ
「I might've felt a bit lonely if I went alone today...」

Natsuki
「And I might've felt a little embarrassed if I went alone too...」

％Ｂ
「Looks like things worked out great after all then, since we got to see it together.」
Natsuki
「That's true. Ahaha.」
％Ｂ
「What do you wanna do now?」
Natsuki
「Hmm... How about we go to the mall? We can just walk around and grab a bite to eat once we're hungry.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah... Okay, let's do that!」
Natsuki
「Wooow, this is so cute!」
Segawa's fawning over a stuffed animal in a claw machine game outside the arcade.

％Ｂ
「Seriously? ...That's a surprise...」
Natsuki
「Huh? What is?」
％Ｂ
「No... I just didn't think you were interested in stuff like that...」
Natsuki
「What the heck? You're saying it's weird for me to like cute things?」

％Ｂ
「No, it isn't weird... it was just surprising to me, I guess.」
Natsuki
「...I am a girl, you know.」
％Ｂ
「My bad. All right, then I'll get you that stuffed animal as an apology.」
Natsuki
「Wha... You can get it?」
％Ｂ
「Oh, come on. Who do you think you're talking to here? I don't study architecture just for show, you know.」

Natsuki
「I don't think that has anything to do with...」
％Ｂ
「No, it's got everything to do with it!」
all
I pull some coins out of my wallet and put them in the slot.
％Ｂ
「Claw machines are all about balance. You gotta make sure the center of balance of the thing you're trying to get falls between the two claws, and you imagine where they're gonna hook in, in three dimensions... It's easy!」


Natsuki
「Y-You sound like you know what you're doing... Is it okay if I start getting hopeful?」
％Ｂ
「Of course it is! Let's go!」
％Ｂ
「...One more try! Just one more try!」
Natsuki
「There's no way. The claw doesn't have any force behind it.」
％Ｂ
「Don't worry. I can just take advantage of the force it has when it comes down instead, and push the stuffed animal to the side!」

％Ｂ
「Judging by how far the claw opens, I'll be able to move it about three centimeters at a time, so I'll be able to get it in five... no, six more tries!」

Natsuki
「That's not just one more try anymore.」
％Ｂ
「But come on, I gotta win! Freakin' fight me like a man, claw machine!」

Natsuki
「It's unexpectedly easy for you to get fired up, you know that?」
％Ｂ
「...Is it?」
Natsuki
「Yeah. Let's give up on the stuffed animal and go somewhere else. You're just going to end up emptying your wallet at this rate.」

％Ｂ
「You're being so considerate about the state of my wallet... You're so nice, Segawa.」
Natsuki
「I wish you'd realize I'm nice over something else...」
％Ｂ
「Something else?」
Natsuki
「Well... I know, I'll treat you to some ice cream.」
％Ｂ
「The heck? That's more of a "comforting a little kid" kinda nice.」
Natsuki
「I'm the one who wants ice cream. You just shut up and tag along.」
％Ｂ
「I'll pay for it, then.」
Natsuki
「You're so dumb. You won't get to see how nice I am that way. And you already spent a lot on that claw machine. So the ice cream's my treat.」


％Ｂ
「But...」
Natsuki
「Just let me pay. You used your money on that claw machine for me anyway, so this time it's my turn to pay.」


％Ｂ
「...Okay. I'll gratefully accept, then.」
Natsuki
「Mmm, delicious! Strawberry cheese is the supreme choice! And with a second scoop of chocolate chip! This is my personal perfect combination!」


％Ｂ
「Huh... You like ice cream that much?」
Natsuki
「That's right. Do you have a problem with that?」
％Ｂ
「No, I just didn't know you liked sweet stuff. Since you only brought those super-spicy rice crackers back when we went camping and stuff.」

Natsuki
「I brought those specifically for a penalty game. I personally have a sweet tooth.」
％Ｂ
「But you're a diet warrior...」
Natsuki
「Ghh... You're bringing that up now? You're really going to bring that up? Well then... Hamh!」

％Ｂ
「Aaagh!? My mint chocolate!?」
Natsuki
「Mufufu... Ish yourh faulh for lehhinh yourh guarh downh!」
％Ｂ
「...You're gonna get fat.」
Natsuki
「Urghhh!? Wh-Why you, that's... That's the death curse that brings diet warriors suffering! Just how do you know it...!?」


％Ｂ
「Fufufu... If you don't want to get fat, then give me some of your strawberry cheese ice cream!」


Natsuki
「Uuuh, you coward!」
％Ｂ
「Pff... Ahahahahah! What the heck are we doing... Ahahah!」

Natsuki
「We're so stupid... But it's fun!」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. You're good at playing along, Segawa.」
Natsuki
「Same for you
, Hino

. Here, have some.」
％Ｂ
「You sure? All right... Hamh.」
Natsuki
「Oh, that's an indirect kiss.」
％Ｂ
「Nghhh!? Gfh... Nnghh... Gulp... C-Come on... Why would you say that just as I take a bite...?」

Natsuki
「But it's the truth.」
％Ｂ
「Then it was an indirect kiss when you ate some of my mint chocolate too.」

Natsuki
「Oh, you're right... I'm kinda getting embarrassed all of a sudden... Ahaha...」

all
％Ｂ
「Hm...?」
A poster on a store window catches my eye as we're walking through the mall.

Natsuki
「Something wrong?」
％Ｂ
「...There's apparently a "Tanabata Festival Photography Contest."」
It's a poster for a contest put on by the city of Shionagi for photos themed around "Tanabata."

％Ｂ
「You ever submit stuff to things like this?」
Natsuki
「Mmm... I've considered it before, but I've never done it. It's not like I'm not interested, but the timing's just never really lined up.」


％Ｂ
「How about submitting to this one? There's still time before the deadline.」

Natsuki
「Yeah... If you say so, then maybe I will. If I get a good photo for it, that is.」

％Ｂ
「You'll be fine. I bet you'll do really well.」
Natsuki
「That's just your bias talking. There's a ton of people out there who take better photos than me. But, well... hearing you say that does make me happy...」


all
Time really does fly when you're having fun.
Our surroundings are dark now that the sun's gone down.
I wanted today to go on forever.
I know our time as lovers has only just started...
But I still think that a first date's something a bit special.
Natsuki
「Ahhh... Today was so much fun! Thanks for coming out with me today!」

％Ｂ
「What are you talking about? It's a date, so you don't need to thank me.」

Natsuki
「Oh, yeah... That's true... But still, thank you. I had so much fun all day long today.」

Natsuki
「I know I might be making a big deal out of things, but I've never had so much fun before... so I want to thank you.」

She communicates her honest feelings with an easy smile.
Natsuki
「Thank you for going on a date with me.」
Her smile's especially bright, even compared to all the other ones I've seen...
Natsuki
「And... thank you... for becoming my boyfriend.」
And her words are stuffed with special feelings...
Natsuki
「I love you... Juuust kidding... Ehehe.」
I take a step forward, prompted by the beating of my heart...
Natsuki
「Hey, let's do something like this again―」
I put my arms around her lower back and pull her close.
Natsuki
「Wha...?」
I move my face toward Segawa's, as if sucked in.
I'm too nervous to worry about her disliking it or saying no.

Natsuki
「Oh...」
Segawa looks surprised for an instant.
But she softly closes her eyes―
Natsuki
「Mmh...」
And we quietly kiss.
Natsuki
「Mmh...nh...」
It's a gentle kiss, with just our lips touching.
It's our first... kiss.
Natsuki
「...Mh...」
Her lips feel a little stiff to me, maybe from nervousness.
...Or maybe I'm the one who's nervous.
But Segawa smells really nice.
％Ｂ
「Nh...」
I quietly pull away.
Natsuki
「...」
Segawa's cheeks are flushed with embarrassment, and she's keeping her gaze low to the ground.
I might've rushed into things by kissing her on our first date.

％Ｂ
「...Segawa...」
I wonder if she's mad...
Natsuki
「...Was that indirect kiss... not enough for you...?」
％Ｂ
「Uuh...」
Natsuki
「But... I guess June 29th's going to be a special day for me now... Ehehe.」
