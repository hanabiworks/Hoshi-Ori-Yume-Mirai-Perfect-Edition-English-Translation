Marika
「Oh, they're on, they're on♪ It's so pretty～♪」
Natsuki
「It's really looking like an aquarium now.」
Segawa's taking photos of the line of tanks.
We're in the middle of attaching cooling fans and lights to the fish tanks.
all
Once we got the lights on, we decided to test them.
The fish tanks seem a lot more legitimate the moment the lights go on.

Misa
「I think this will be a very fine aquarium!」
Okihara-senpai seems satisfied with how the tanks look too.
I'm happy that these tanks I've spent so much time on look good... at least... I should be, but...

all
Marika
「Ousaka-san, let's try turning these on, too.」

Sora
「...*nod*」
all
％Ｂ
「...」
But I can't stop myself from looking more at Shinozaki than at the tanks.
Touko
「...Hmm. I see.」
all
I give a start at Yukimura's voice.
％Ｂ
「Wh-What? What do you see?」
Touko
「...Maybe you should be paying attention to the fish tanks for now?」
％Ｂ
「I'm looking at them too.」
Touko
「Them "too"?」
She smirks.
Misa
「Oh, has something happened?」
all
Marika
「Huh? Did I do something wrong...?」
％Ｂ
「N-No, it's nothing! I'll be checking the tanks over here!」

all
Marika
「Okay, thanks. But don't overexert yourself, you'll hurt your leg, okay～」

％Ｂ
「I know.」
all
Anyway, I need to focus on the tanks before me.
But...
Marika
「Then could you hold those, Ousaka-san?」
Sora
「Okay.」
％Ｂ
「...」
Why do I keep watching Shinozaki today? Is it because of what happened yesterday?

all
％Ｂ
「It's 'cause my mom was teasing me...」
Shuuichi
「Hmm? Miss your mommy?」
％Ｂ
「What? Shuuichi.」
I turn around to see Shuuichi behind me.
Shuuichi
「Looks like you're all lonely after getting hurt. Guess it's not surprising you miss your mommy.」

％Ｂ
「Shut up. This isn't a big deal.」

I raise my foot and show him my cast.
Shuuichi glances at it, and idly looks away.
Shuuichi
「Well, it's good that you're doing well.」
％Ｂ
「You came all the way here to check up on me?」
Shuuichi
「It may just be a crack, but it's still a fracture. Though it looks like there wasn't any need for me to worry.」

He was being annoying, but it seems like he was honestly worried.
％Ｂ
「Oh... Thanks, man.」
％Ｂ
「But still, this leg's so inconvenient. I don't think I'll be able to go help get more fish either.」

Okihara-senpai and Shinozaki both told me that it'd be too dangerous for me to go back like this.

Shuuichi
「Want me to take your place, then? Getting to see Okihara-senpai and Shinozaki in their swimsuits would be a nice bonus.」

％Ｂ
「Shinozaki's swimsuit...」
％Ｂ
「N-No, I'm not doing it because of anything like that, all right!?」

Shuuichi
「...What are you getting so red for? It's just a joke. I've got Kaori-san's mature swimsuit to look at.」


％Ｂ
「What? ...A joke?」
Shuuichi
「It's suspicious that you'd get so defensive. Maybe you're the one who's got some ulterior motives?」

％Ｂ
「O-Of course I don't!」
Shuuichi
「...Like I said. You're getting too defensive.」
％Ｂ
「Urgh...」
I must look so weird today.
Shuuichi
「Anyway, if you ever need my help, let me know anytime.」

Misa
「Thank you very much. However, we will be temporarily stopping our activities after today.」

Shuuichi
「You will?」
Marika
「Of course～ We have exams.」
Shuuichi
「Exams... Oh, because finals are next week...」
all
Shuuichi goes pale.
％Ｂ
「What? You forgot?」
Shuuichi
「Yeah, because I've been so busy with the event committee lately. Right, finals are next week...」

％Ｂ
「You all right? It'd be an issue if the event committee chair failed, right?」

Shuuichi
「It-It's fine! I'm up to date on my preparing and reviewing. Periodic exams are no big deal as long as you just keep working at what you do in class.」


％Ｂ
「You say that, but you look pale. It'd be an issue if you're stupid when you're wearing glasses.」

Shuuichi
「Wearing glasses doesn't mean I'm smart! Though I am smart, just so you know!」


Marika
「That's right. I'm sure Nirasawa-kun will be okay. We'll have to study up too. Otherwise, we won't have time for the Tanabata Festival.」


％Ｂ
「Y-Yeah... Yeah, you're right.」
all
Sora
「You're nervous. Not confident?」
％Ｂ
「That's not what I'm nervous about.」

Misa
「Oh? So you are nervous, then?」
％Ｂ
「What? Uhh, no...」
all
Marika
「I think you'll be fine too
, Hino-kun

～」
She smiles innocently.
That smile tells me she believes in me, from the bottom of her heart... and seeing that smile makes my heart throb.

％Ｂ
「...」
Marika
「Mm? What's wrong?」
％Ｂ
「Uh... A-Anyway, let's finish this already. We should get this over with so we can get to studying.」

Marika
「Yeah, you're right. I'll need to do my best with exams too!」
Shinozaki resumes working with gusto.
And no matter how hard I try not to, I still find my gaze following her every movement.
