Shuuichi
「I need you two to work separately starting today. Ryousuke, you check on each club's progress. Yukimura, you're in charge of the old school building like before.」


Shuuichi
「I need you two to work separately starting today.」
I asked Shuuichi to instruct Touko and me to work separately.\n\r

That way, I'll be able to move freely without suspicion.
Touko
「Whaaat, I don't wanna work all by myself... You never told me I'd have to do thiiis.」

Shuuichi
「I know, but... you know how busy we are, right? It'd be great if you could be understanding...」

Touko
「No. I don't wanna have less time together.」
Shuuichi
「...」
Shuuichi looks at me.
It's a complex look that says, "You better make up for this later...!" and "Damn you two for being so flirty when we're so busy...!"

％Ｂ
「Come on, Touko. I'll drop by the old school building as much as I can.」

Touko
「Geez... Fiiine. I really don't want to, but I'll put up with it just for a bit.」

Shuuichi
「...What's with this difference in how she responds!? What's the difference between me and this guy!?」

％Ｂ
「Gotta be the glasses.」
Shuuichi
「The hell did you say!? I'll have you know there are plenty of girls who're into glasses! This is a positive trait, you freaking naked-eye savage! You should be embarrassed walking around in public like that!」


...How am I supposed to respond to this sermon?
Is this guy really that attached to his glasses?
all
I part ways with Touko and start my work alone.
I have to do my event committee work while making my request to people. I'll end up not having enough time if I don't work quickly.

I'm going to go around to the clubs that are planning on doing indoor displays first.
Things'll be much easier for me later on if I get through enough of the indoor stuff today.

％Ｂ
「Excuse meee, event committee heeere.」
Female Student A
「Oh, there's our help! Grab him, grab him!」
％Ｂ
「Whoa!? Wh-What's going on!?」
Female Student B
「Let's put you to work right away! I can't believe you're already here. Good on Nirasawa. He's fast.」


％Ｂ
「Wh-What are you talking about!? I'm just here to check progress!」
Female Student B
「What? Really? Aw, we thought you were someone else.」
％Ｂ
「Just let go of me! You can't just grab people outta nowhere like that!」

I can feel soft stuff on my arms!
I'm so glad Touko wasn't here... she definitely would've been sulking afterward.

Female Student B
「Oh, sorry about that. But you're always stuck right against Yukimura-san, so you don't mind, right? Since you probably do way more intense stuff together.」


％Ｂ
「N-No, we don't! Seriously, what the heck do you people think we are!?」

Female Student A
「We're jealous of how lovey-dovey you two are! Meanwhile, we're killing ourselves over preparing for the Tanabata Festival, and there aren't even any good guys around us either.」

Female Student B
「Right!? I seriously don't understand why there's so much of a difference. What do you think of us, as a guy?」


％Ｂ
「Don't freaking ask me! I didn't come here to chat! Just tell me how you're progressing!」

Female Student A
「Geez, why can't you talk at least a little? ...We're about 70 percent done so far.」

Female Student B
「We should make it in time, since we asked Nirasawa to send help too. I think we might end up cutting it a little close for the decorations, though.」

％Ｂ
「Finally... All right, so I can put down that there aren't any issues here?」

Female Student A
「Mhm. Thank yoooou!」
％Ｂ
「I've also got a bit of a personal request... You mind?」

Touko
「...He's laaate.」
It's already way past lunchtime...
I'm starting to get hungry. I wish he'd come back alreadyyy...
Touko
「...I guess there's nothing he can do about being busy since the festival's soon.」
I'll wait a little longer.
I'm sure he's hungry from all his work. We promised we'd have lunch together this morning... and I just wanna be with him in general.

Touko
「I'm like a newlywed waiting for her husband to come home. Ehehe, this might be kinda nice.」

It might be perfect if I had an apron.
Now I'm thinking about when he was teaching me how to cook... That sure was fun.
Oh, what if I had him wear a suit?
I imagine myself looking at the clock, waiting for him to come home in a slightly cramped apartment... Mhm, I like that.

Touko
「I wanna pretend to be newlyweds again. I should practice a bit later.」

I don't hate fantasizing.
It's a good way to kill time, and I get to create a world where everything's the way I like it.
In this last month... the world I've drawn out for myself's changed.
I see the two of us, alone together, smiling happily at each other.
That's my ideal world... The one I imagine now.
He's smiling that smile I love, always by my side.
He gave me this comforting warmth and lots of ticklish feelings... and showed me how my heart can beat so fast in this way I can't put a name to.

Touko
「...We can keep going for a little longer, right?」
％Ｂ
「Sorry I'm late, Touko.」
I hurry back to the old school building.
I ended up about an hour later than our usual lunchtime.
Touko
「Oh, welcome back. Ahh, you're finally baaack... I'm hungryyy.」

％Ｂ
「Huh? I told you over LIME to eat without me, didn't I? You didn't see my message?」

Touko
「No, I did. I was waiting... because I thought lunch would taste better with you.」

Touko's thoughtfulness makes me happy.
Motivation surges in me.
I have to make her happy no matter what.
I want to communicate my... our feelings to her. I can clearly feel my determination welling up inside me.

all
I ended up taking a long time going around to everywhere I could.
I think it was worth it. I accomplished a lot for the first day of doing this.
％Ｂ
「I wonder if Touko's mad...」
％Ｂ
「Sorry, I ended up being out the whole day... Wait, what are you doing?」

Touko
「Wah!? You scared me! No coming back with no warning like that!」

％Ｂ
「Wha...?」
Touko
「Oh, it's already this late. You're done for today?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, I finished my work for today.」
Touko
「I was pretty busy over here, you know. Everyone kept bringing me more and more paperwork... I'm bored of stamping stuff.」


％Ｂ
「I see. Great work today, then. Let's do our best tomorrow too.」
It's going to take a little more time to prepare.
I'll need to put in lots of hard work for this plan to bear lots of fruit.
Touko
「Okaaay. My right arm's going to get all big at this rate...」

％Ｂ
「As if... I think you're just being too picky about where you stamp.」

Touko
「It's hard to do it straight and clean, you know. You have to push down from above and kinda move your hand in a spiral...」

Even the pointless stuff is fun with Touko.
Idle chatter becomes special when I'm together with her.
I'm going to do my best for now... so I can continue my relationship with her.
