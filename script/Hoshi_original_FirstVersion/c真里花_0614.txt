Saturday. Everyone's gathered in the committee room.
We're here to discuss putting Okihara-senpai's suggestion into motion.
％Ｂ
「And so, I'm thinking... since we want to do what we can now, we'll go with Okihara-senpai's suggestion and start gathering up fish for the aquarium.」


Natsuki
「But how are we gonna do that? Are we gonna go fishing?」


Marika
「I feel like the fish would get hurt～」
％Ｂ
「Okihara-senpai, if you could explain.」
all
Misa
「Yes, please allow me!」
She stands up happily, her hair floating behind her.
Misa
「There is a much easier way to obtain rare fish. Are you all aware of something known as "migratory fish death"?」

Touko
「Migratory... fish... death?」
all
Natsuki
「That seems kinda dangerous. Like a sign of the end times or something.」
Sora
「Everything dies, even the stars... and migratory fish are no exception... Is that what it means?」

all
Misa
「Oh no, it's not a dangerous thing. There are fish that get washed toward Japan from the tropics by the Kuroshio current.」


Misa
「They're also called seasonal incidental fish. The "death" part of it comes from the fact that the fish all die once the water temperature falls in the winter.」


Natsuki
「Hmm. That's a confusing name for it.」
Marika
「But that means you can catch tropical fish here? They'd be really pretty then, right?」

Misa
「Oh yes, they're wonderfully pretty. They're mostly fish of a family known as Chaetodontidae, or butterflyfish. As the name would suggest, they're graceful and vivid in coloration.」


Misa
「And they are migratory fish, so unlike local wildlife, we will have relatively little impact on the local ecosystem if we choose to take them. I believe them to be perfect for this display for those reasons.」


％Ｂ
「I see. Yes, it's important for us to be environmentally conscious.」

all
Natsuki
「They're going to die anyway once the temperature falls in winter, right? It's probably better for them to be kept by us.」

Touko
「So we just have to grab those to-be-dead fish, right?」
％Ｂ
「I dunno about calling them that.」
all
Misa
「We will also have to prepare water tanks for them afterward.」

Marika
「Yeah, it wouldn't be good if we didn't have a place to put them after catching them.」

Misa
「I already have a few extra water tanks, so we will have to clean and prepare them.」

all
Touko
「But... going by that plan, we're going to need lots of tanks, right? Are the extra ones going to be enough?」

％Ｂ
「Hmm... No, I don't think so... right?」
I doubt the naturalist club's tanks will be enough.
And most of those are stuffed full of jellyfish at this point anyway. It depends on how many extra tanks she has, but I don't think we can expect too much.

all
Misa
「No, I only have two tanks... We currently don't have even close to enough for what we would require.」

all
Marika
「Those are... expensive, right?」
Natsuki
「Can't we just grab some money from the school for it?」
％Ｂ
「This is where the handsome and smart Shuuichi-san can show us all how cool he is by increasing our budget.」

all
Shuuichi
「There's no way I could do that. Every club has to have the same amount.」

all
An indignant Shuuichi walks in.
％Ｂ
「Tch... Guess I shouldn't have bothered asking this four-eyed stick insect in the first place.」
Shuuichi
「You're not matching up with what you just said a few seconds ago!」
％Ｂ
「And what, you're here?」
Shuuichi
「I'm unexpectedly busy with all this. I came by to check, since I saw that the window was open when I was walking through the inner courtyard.」


Shuuichi
「Anyway, don't expect any favoritism for budget.」
％Ｂ
「Well, I figured it wouldn't work out... I guess I should just be grateful about getting permission to use the old school building.」

We don't have money, but there are certain things we need.
And I doubt the water tanks will be the last of our worries.
all
Misa
「I believe we will be able to make do for a while with the spare tanks, so let's consider the issue again at a later time.」

Misa
「For the present... Would you like to survey where we can gather fish?」
％Ｂ
「Survey?」
Misa
「Yes. I would like to check to see the environment and the quantity of fish where we plan on gathering the fish.」

Misa
「I believe our needs for display and materials may change based on those results.」

％Ｂ
「That's true.」
It's great that we have a specialist here with us.
We probably won't have any problems with the fish as long as we follow what she says.
％Ｂ
「Then let's have a few of us go do that tomorrow. Okihara-senpai will go, of course, and who else? ...I guess people who are good at swimming?」


all
Marika
「Oh, m-me!」
Touko
「That was unexpected. And wait, you're good at swimming?」

Marika
「I-I think I might be better than you'd think～ I work part-time at the pool, too.」

％Ｂ
「You've got a point. You might be a good fit for that, then. I'm counting on you for this, Shinozaki.」

Marika
「Yeah, of course!」
all
Misa
「I would also like for you to come
, Ryousuke-san

. Some heavy lifting may be required...」

％Ｂ
「I understand. You can leave that to me, then.」


Touko
「Good luuuck. We'll relax and wait for you guys.」
Misa
「Oh, then could I ask you to prepare the water tanks? Though it would only be cleaning them and placing sand and water inside.」


Touko
「Seems kinda dull...」
％Ｂ
「Sorry, but please. And I bet you'll get less people trying to recruit you once they know that you're helping us out.」

Touko
「Mmm... That's true.」
all
Natsuki
「I wanna go to the ocean too～ I wanna take photos.」

％Ｂ
「Sorry, but could you help out here? Don't worry, we'll bring back lots of pretty fish that you'll be just dying to take photos of.」


Natsuki
「Mmm, fiiiine.」

Touko
「Well, I guess I'd rather be somewhere nice and cool instead of somewhere hot.」
all
Misa
「Then I will tell you what you need to watch out for when placing the sand. It is nothing too difficult.」

all
Sora
「Do we have star sand?」
％Ｂ
「Man, that's a blast from the past... But I doubt it.」
all
And so, Okihara-senpai, Shinozaki, and I are going to the ocean tomorrow. 
all
And Ousaka, Segawa, and Yukimura are going to be preparing the water tanks.
all
It finally feels like we've started doing something.
I'm gonna give it my all!
