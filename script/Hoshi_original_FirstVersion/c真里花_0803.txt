「I wanna discuss restoring the planetarium.」
The next day.
I speak to everyone once we've assembled in the old school building.
Everyone showed up as a matter of course in the morning.
％Ｂ
「First, I've decided to change out the big light bulb.」
That all happened because I picked a big incandescent light bulb just because it had the highest wattage.

Touko
「But won't it be too dim then?」
％Ｂ
「That was a misunderstanding of mine. You're right that we need it to be bright, but what the planetarium apparently needs is for the light source to be as close to a point of light as possible.」



Rikka
「Close to a point of light? I don't get what you're talking about...」
all
Sora
「...The pinhole-style planetarium that we're making directly projects the shape of the light source, which is the light bulb filament itself. That becomes more obvious the further away the projection surface is.」


Marika
「Umm～?」
％Ｂ
「Complicated talk aside, it just means that the light bulbs we've been using up until now make it so that stars further away from the source end up looking warped. We need a light with a small filament to prevent that.」


Sora
「...And this is it.」
Ousaka shows us the new light bulb.
It's astonishingly small.
Natsuki
「Is it okay if it's that small?」
Sora
「...It's okay. This is better.」
％Ｂ
「Ousaka found one of these for us. It's apparently made for use in planetariums.」

Sora
「...It doesn't have a long lifespan because it's a prototype. But that's not a problem because we'll only use it for a day.」

％Ｂ
「There's no heat issues with this, so we won't have any repeats of last time.」
all
Touko
「So if that's solved, then what about the all-important star sphere that melted?」
％Ｂ
「About that... I want you all to look at this.」
all
I show them the rough sketch I drew.
They all look taken aback.
Misa
「A regular dodecahedron?」
％Ｂ
「Yes. I was thinking we could make it like this.」
all
The new Mk. 3's design is a dodecahedron.
The sphere's made out of twelve evenly sized sides.
Natsuki
「...It's covered in corners.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. 'Cause it's a dodecahedron.」

Rikka
「Will you be able to project them properly like this?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, we will. I've found real-life examples like this too.」

％Ｂ
「I wanted to go with a regular icosahedron, but this is what I ended up with after cutting down the number of sides as much as possible.」

all
I had the preconception that a planetarium needed to be a "sphere."
But all that we need is for it to be as close to a sphere as possible.
I had let that preconception spoil my design right from the get-go.
％Ｂ
「We'll be able to divide it into twelve parts like this. That way, we'll be able to split up the work between all of us. We can even take the parts home and work on them there.」


Touko
「So what you're saying is you want us to do work at home too.」
％Ｂ
「I'm not gonna force you... but it'd really help us if you did.」
Touko
「Hey, don't lower your head. Now that we've gotten this far, I'll stick with you guys until the end.」


Rikka
「That's true. It would feel gross if I stopped partway.」
％Ｂ
「Yukimura... and Narusawa too...」
all
Natsuki
「But we have seven people here, so we don't have enough people for all of them.」

With twelve sides, if we have each person do one, there'll still be five left over.
all
％Ｂ
「I'll do the remainder.」
Marika
「One person can't do six of them～! I'll help too.」

all
Sora
「...Me too.」
There's a note of insistence in Ousaka's voice.
Sora
「...I'm in the astronomy club. So I'm doing three.」
％Ｂ
「But that's...」
Sora
「I'm doing it.」
％Ｂ
「I get how you feel. But...」
If only we had more helping hands...
all
Shuuichi
「I've already heard everything.」
％Ｂ
「Dammit! ...Isn't there anyone we could rely on...?」
Shuuichi
「Honestly. This is just like you. You didn't tell me anything? That's cold, man.」

％Ｂ
「Just one more person... If only there were one more person who could help...!」
Shuuichi
「Come on now, I don't need any thanks. Today you, tomorrow me. That's what friendship's all about, right?」


％Ｂ
「Dammit... If only I had more friends...!」
Shuuichi
「Wait, you're ignoring me on purpose, aren't you!?」
％Ｂ
「H-Hey!? Shuuichi, you were here?」
Shuuichi
「Rely on me! Rely on me, okay!?」
％Ｂ
「U-Uhh～ ...But you're the event committee chairman, aren't you? Do you have the time to be helping us?」

Shuuichi
「You're right. I haven't gotten much sleep these past two days... and actually, I haven't really taken any baths either...」

％Ｂ
「No way... I dunno if that's okay during summer...」
Touko
「You sure there isn't something you should do before offering help?」
Shuuichi
「But still, I'll sacrifice myself for my friends!」
Marika
「Nirasawa-kun's the type that likes scenes like these～」

Natsuki
「Well, that's fine! If he says he'll do it, then let's have him do it! You'll do two of them, then!」


Shuuichi
「What!? Two of them!? Wait, that's...!」
Natsuki
「Just so you know, if any of the pinholes are off, you'll regret it!」
％Ｂ
「All right, it's decided, then! Let's figure out who's doing what on the starmap!」

all
Sora
「I'll make copies right away.」
all
％Ｂ
「Let's do this, everyone!」
Everyone nods in unison in response.
We might really be able to pull this off.
I have no basis for that thought, but I believe it. 
all
Shuuichi
「Let's... Let's do thiiis...!?」
