Touko
「I'm going, theeen. I think I'll be able to leave a little earlier today.」

％Ｂ
「All right. Have a good day. Be careful.」
Touko
「Mhm, thanks. Chu.」
all
We don't have classes today.
I see Touko off as she leaves for work, and then it's time for me to keep studying for my exam at home.

％Ｂ
「Okay. Let's get started.」
I'm going to be working at my internship all day tomorrow.
I need to do my best and get two days' worth of studying done today.
I sit at my desk and start working.
Let's see, where did I leave off yesterday...?
Touko
「I'm hooome... Oh. You're always working so hard. Doesn't it hurt sitting down all day?」

％Ｂ
「Oh, it's that late already? Welcome home, Touko.」
Touko
「Mhm, I'm home. Chu.」
Touko peers at my desk and kisses me.
I had realized that it was nighttime, but still... Time passes really quickly when you're focused.

Touko
「It's great that you're focused and all, but you need to rest a little too. It'd be terrible if you got sick before the exam, right?」

％Ｂ
「I know, but I just can't help it. I just forget about the time.」

Touko
「You're so passionate. Do you really still have to do this, with all the studying you've already done?」

She looks at my open reference book again.
She grimaces and pulls away.
Touko
「...I never have any idea what you're even reading. Just looking at the questions makes my head hurt.」

％Ｂ
「Does it? Just reading drafting questions gets me excited, personally.」

Touko
「I do want to see something like a world-famous church, though. What's that really crazy one that isn't done yet again?」

I dunno if I can pull off world-renowned level right off the bat...
If the exam were just "Design a world heritage site," there'd be zero people who'd pass for sure.

Touko
「...You know, seeing you try so hard... makes me wonder... if I'm really okay like this.


」

％Ｂ
「You've already figured out where you're going to work. You can just enjoy the rest of your time at university without worrying about me.」


Touko already knows where she's working after university. She's unexpectedly good at getting by in the world, I guess.\n\r
She interviewed and was accepted at various different companies, and eventually accepted an unofficial job offer at a travel agency.

I knew that she had been studying English... but I didn't think she would get a job offer that quickly.\n 

I was a bit surprised.
Touko
「Mmm... I mean more like if I should be thinking more about my future. I might already know where I'm going to work, but I don't want to just be having fun on my own.」

％Ｂ
「I think you've already done a lot. It's pretty hard to even get a job offer these days.」

It's always something about employment rates and business scaling and whatever.
I hear about it on the news a lot.
I'm sure that these are pretty rough circumstances for job finding.
Which means that Touko's impressive for getting a job offer amidst those circumstances.
Touko
「...I think I'll get dinner ready. You're hungry, right?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. I haven't eaten anything, come to think of it.」
Touko
「Come on, you have to eat properly. You won't be able to take the exam if you get sick.」

％Ｂ
「Sorry. Thanks. I'll be careful from now on.」
Touko
「Geez... You said the same thing last time, didn't you? Maybe I'm going to have to start preparing lunch for you beforehand too...」

I'm grateful that Touko's worried for my health. I'll keep studying until dinner's ready.

％Ｂ
「I want to pass for sure. I need to do my best, so I can thank you for supporting me too.」

Touko
「...Mhm. Good luck.」
