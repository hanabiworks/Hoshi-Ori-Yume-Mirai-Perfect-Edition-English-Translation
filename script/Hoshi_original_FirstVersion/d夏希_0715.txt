Natsuki
「Morniiing!」
％Ｂ
「Hey... Morning.」
Rikka
「Good morning...」
％Ｂ
「You're pretty cheerful today...」
Natsuki
「Because exams are over, yeah. Of course I'm cheerful. I can do grad-alb work again starting today!」


％Ｂ
「I'm jealous. I'm so worried about my exam results.」

Natsuki
「You'll be fine. Think about how much we studied together.」
Rikka
「...You two studied together?」
Natsuki
「Mhm. We were helping each other with the stuff we were bad at.」
％Ｂ
「Though it ended up being mostly me teaching...」
Natsuki
「Yeah, I guess you taught me lots～」
％Ｂ
「Well... I guess you could say I was taught lots too...」
Natsuki
「...」
％Ｂ
「...」
Natsuki
「Eheheeeh～」
％Ｂ
「Hahaha...」
Rikka
「...What do people call couples like you two again...?」
％Ｂ
「Oh, come on, Narusawa. We haven't done anything cringey.」

Natsuki
「That's right, we're totally normal. We're a completely normal, wholesome co...coup... Lovers... It's still kinda embarrassiiing!」

Rikka
「...You two are perfect for each other...」
all
Homeroom Teacher
「Okay everyone, to your seats. Err, I'll be handing back the results of your final exams from last week for today's homeroom. Come up to get them when I call your name. Akasaka... Iijima... Ueno...」
％Ｂ
「Hey... I thought they give exam results back during classes?」

Rikka
「That's what they do for the actual answer sheets. Right now we're getting the results form that has our scores for all subjects.」

％Ｂ
「Huh, they give us stuff like that here?」
Rikka
「They'll put up a list of the top ten people in our year by the end of the week too.」
％Ｂ
「Huh... Guess that's got nothing to do with me...」
Homeroom Teacher
「Shimada... Suda... Segawa...」
Natsuki
「Yes!」
Oh, there's Natsuki's name.
I hope she did okay...
all
Homeroom Teacher
「Togashi... Nakajima... Narusawa...」
Rikka
「Yes.」
％Ｂ
「Do your best, Narusawa.」
Rikka
「What do I have to do my best on at this point...?」
Homeroom Teacher
「Nomura... Hamada... Hino...」
％Ｂ
「Yes.」
I go to get my sheet from the teacher and return to my seat.
I get my sheet from the teacher too once my name's called.
all
％Ｂ
「Phew...」
I haven't looked at the contents yet.
I leave it face down on my desk and take a breath to steady myself.
Rikka
「Aren't you going to look?」
％Ｂ
「...I'm gonna do it now.」
％Ｂ
「By the way, how'd you do?」
Rikka
「...Do you want to look?」
％Ｂ
「Uh... You sure?」
Rikka
「It's not like it matters if you see.」
all
Narusawa hands me her sheet so I can look.
％Ｂ
「Whoa... This is amazing...!」
She got high 80s on pretty much every subject.
Rikka
「Why don't you look at your own already?」
％Ｂ
「Ye...Yeah, you're right...」
all
I hand Narusawa her results back and grab the edge of my own sheet of paper.
...I'll be fine. I never failed an exam at my last school.
I exhale, and flip it over.
Rikka
「...How did you do?」
％Ｂ
「75 on Japanese, 73 on English, 90 on math, 80 on Japanese history, 87 on physics, 79 on biology, 95 on health...」

Rikka
「So no problems at all, then. Though it's a little strange that your highest score is in health... Why were you so worried when you did this well?」


％Ｂ
「Well, because the textbooks are different, and I heard there was gonna be material that you guys covered before I transferred in. You can't blame me for being worried.」


Rikka
「...It looks like there wasn't any need for me to worry.」
％Ｂ
「Hm? You were worried about me?」
Rikka
「Hgh... N-No, I wasn't... It was just on my mind because you were so worried before we took the exams.」

Rikka
「More importantly, why don't you go worry about Segawa-san? She's been frozen stiff ever since she looked at her results.」

％Ｂ
「Wha...」
all
I look at Natsuki to see that Narusawa's right. She's staring at her sheet, not moving a muscle.

％Ｂ
「What the... Is she all right?」
She didn't fail, did she...?
I'm worried. I walk over to her.
％Ｂ
「Hey, Natsuki...?」
Natsuki
「Wha, wha... Wha...」
％Ｂ
「...Wha?」
Natsuki
「What the heeeeeeeeeeeeckkk!?」
Everyone in the classroom looks at us in surprise.
My eyes are wide.
Natsuki
「91 on Japanese, 95 on English, 97 on math, 100 on Japanese history, 92 on physics, 100 on biology, 98 on music, 95 on health...!」

％Ｂ
「Wha...? Wait a sec, are those your scores...?」
Natsuki
「...I've never seen numbers like these before...」
％Ｂ
「You got over 90 in every subject... and full marks for Japanese history and biology... Isn't this good enough to make top ten?」

Natsuki
「What am I going to do? They might think I cheated because I got scores this good out of nowhere!」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, right. You'll be fine.」
Natsuki
「B-But...」
％Ｂ
「Don't worry. I'll testify for you if that happens. I'll tell them that you studied hard for these exams.」

Natsuki
「But I can't believe I got scores like these even for math and physics, just because I worked hard... It's unreal.」

％Ｂ
「You've always been capable of doing this. You just haven't been trying things the right way until now.」

％Ｂ
「You were able to get results like these 'cause you figured things out. This is your genuine ability, so you can be prouder of it.」

Natsuki
「No... It's because you tried your hardest to teach me everything
, Ryousuke

... That's why I was able to do so well.」

％Ｂ
「No, it's definitely your own efforts.」
Natsuki
「It's thanks to you.」
％Ｂ
「No, you're just amazing.」
Natsuki
「No, 
Ryousuke, 

you're the one who's amazing.」
Rikka
「Hrrmph... Ahem...!」
We turn around when Narusawa clears her throat.
all
Our classmates are looking at us with unamused eyes.

％Ｂ
「U-Uh...?」
Rikka
「...You're very much a cringey couple.」
all
Everyone bursts out laughing at Narusawa's judgment.
％Ｂ
「Auh...」
Natsuki
「...」
Natsuki and I just go bright red and shrink ourselves down...
all
After school.
Natsuki and I went to the committee office for our first bout of committee work in a week.

Shuuichi
「I see, so you managed not to fail.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah... We managed, yeah.」
Shuuichi
「...Segawa did all right too, right? To be honest, I'm more worried about her than you.」

％Ｂ
「Man... I wanna see if you're still saying the same thing when they put up the rankings.」

Shuuichi
「Come in.」
all
Sora
「...Excuse me.」
％Ｂ
「Yo, Ousaka. Long time no see.」
Sora
「...I brought the list of constellations I want.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, for the photos? Just one second. Hey, Natsuki.」

Shuuichi
「Natsuki...?」
all
Natsuki
「What is iiit?」
％Ｂ
「Ousaka said she's brought the list of constellations she wants photos of, so come and take a look.」

Natsuki
「Okay
, Ryousuke

.」
all
Shuuichi
「
Ryousuke...? Hey, since when have you two called each other by first name?
...? Hey, since when do you call her by first name?
」

％Ｂ
「Hm?」
Shuuichi
「You two just used last names before, didn't you?」
％Ｂ
「Well, we are boyfriend and girlfriend, so it's not that weird, right?」
Shuuichi
「Hmm... I guess that means things have progressed between you two. Studying for exams... I get it. A good use of your time indeed.」

％Ｂ
「...Wh-What are you talking about?」
Dammit... He's sharp...
Shuuichi
「Hmph... Looks like you've finally become a man too. Now you're finally even with me.」

％Ｂ
「Again, why are you acting so superior...? And you already said I caught up last time.」

Shuuichi
「I just said you caught up last time, not that we were even. But now I'll acknowledge you. You and I, we're in the same spot now.」

％Ｂ
「Being acknowledged by you doesn't really make me happy...」
Shuuichi
「...So how was it? Did it feel good?」
％Ｂ
「...Don't ask me stuff like that, man.」
Shuuichi
「Why not? I don't have anyone around to talk about stuff like this with.」

％Ｂ
「Uh... Why do you have to talk to someone about it...?」
Shuuichi
「...Was Segawa cute?」
％Ｂ
「Hm... Well... Yeah, she was crazy cute.」
Shuuichi
「Listen to you brag, you bastard!」
％Ｂ
「Man～ Haha... It's great knowing I'm the only one who gets to see Natsuki when she's being that cute～」

Shuuichi
「What kinda stuff did she do for you?」
％Ｂ
「Just normal stuff. The kinda stuff everyone does. It's just, she did some "prep studying" herself for me...」

Shuuichi
「Segawa did? Didn't expect her to be so devoted.」
％Ｂ
「You didn't? I think it fits her personality to a T.」
Natsuki
「Weeell～ Doesn't this sound like a fun conversation～」
Shuuichi
「Eek!」
％Ｂ
「Aagh!」
Natsuki
「
Ryousuke-kuuun～
You knooow～
 I think you might be just a liiittle too chatty.」
％Ｂ
「Gasp...! What the―I fell for leading questions from the likes of Shuuichi!」

Natsuki
「Thanks sooo much for calling me cute. But that isn't something to talk to others about, is it!?」

％Ｂ
「Yes... You're exactly right. I'm very sorry...」
Natsuki
「Honestly now. I'm not letting you see my new prep for a while.」
％Ｂ
「Uh...?」
...New prep? She's totally saying way more than I ever did...
Natsuki
「Sora, let's go up to the roof. We're going to catch their pervert disease if we stay here.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
all
％Ｂ
「...」
This is just a guess, but I'm pretty sure Natsuki's way more perverted than I am.
I go follow them upstairs and give an honest apology so I can participate... I mean, so I can be allowed to participate in the discussion.

Natsuki
「It's best to take photos of stars in as dark a place as possible, right?」

Sora
「...Right. A place with no light around is ideal.」
Natsuki
「If we want a place with no light around nearby...」
Sora
「...Somewhere like the campground from before.」
Natsuki
「Yeah... I guess that might be the best spot.」
all
％Ｂ
「Wait a second. You're gonna do it at night, obviously, right? Isn't it gonna be dangerous for a girl to be at a place like that at night?」

Natsuki
「There shouldn't be any issue if you're there.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, so it's a given that I'm coming with...」
Though I was planning on coming right from the start.
Natsuki
「Obviously. You're my assistant.」
Natsuki
「So this is the list of constellations you want pictures of, right? Let's see... Cygnus, Lyra, Scorpio... There's a lot on here.」

％Ｂ
「Corona Borealis, Corona Australis, Sagitta, Scutum... Do of all these really exist?」


Sora
「...Corona Borealis is west of Hercules, and Corona Australis is south of Sagittarius.」

Natsuki
「Sagittarius is famous.」
％Ｂ
「Chiron... Poor, poor Chiron...」
Natsuki
「Wha? The heck? What are you talking about?」
％Ｂ
「No, nothing... Don't worry about it.」
Natsuki
「But this is going to be difficult without knowing which constellations are where.」

Sora
「...No issues. Here.」
all
She pulls out a plastic disk.
％Ｂ
「Oh, I've seen one of these before. It's one of those things where you can line up the date and time and it tells you the general positions of the constellations, right?」

Sora
「...It's a planisphere. You can find most constellations with this.」

Natsuki
「Haven't seen one of these since grade school. Are you letting us borrow this?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
Natsuki
「Thanks. I'll try it out, then.」
％Ｂ
「When do you wanna go?」
Natsuki
「Let's see... It'd be best to do it after summer break starts. We won't need to worry about the time if we don't have school the next day.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah... We'll still make it in time for the Tanabata Festival if we do it as soon as break starts, so that should be fine.」

Sora
「...No issues.」
Natsuki
「Oh, right. I'm going to be changing cameras for this.」
％Ｂ
「You can't take photos of stars with the one you're using now?」
Natsuki
「Mmm, I don't think I'll be able to get shots of anything other than the brightest stars right now. If I'm taking photos of constellations, I'll need to get the dimmer ones too, right? A film camera is the best option then.」


Sora
「...*nod*」
all
Natsuki
「I've never taken photos of stars before, but it looks fun. It's been a while since I've gotten this excited.」

Natsuki's wearing her serious cameraman expression now.

Natsuki
「I'll get great photos that are exactly what you want, Sora. Look forward to them!」
Sora
「...*nod*」
Natsuki's really dependable in times like these.
I really admire that part of her.
I like seeing the cute Natsuki who's my girlfriend...
But I have to say, I like seeing her as a cameraman too.
