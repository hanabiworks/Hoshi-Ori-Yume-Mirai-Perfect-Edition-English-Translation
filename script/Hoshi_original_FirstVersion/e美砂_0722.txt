We've finally started on the final stage of preparations now that we have the additional tanks.
We're attaching the LED constellations that Ousaka and the others made to the tanks today.
They've printed out photos of the constellations onto black plastic boards.

Each photo is of one constellation and the stars that surround it.
They opened up holes just in the stars that form the constellation, and placed the LEDs in those holes.

Touko
「So how do we attach these?」
Rikka
「We can just attach them to the backs of the tanks, boards and all, right?」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, let's do that.」
all
We all help out with attaching the constellations to the fish tanks.
Natsuki
「Mmm... Maybe I shouldn't be saying this, but doesn't this look kinda cheap?」
Marika
「S-Segawa-san... You can't say that after all the hard work everyone's done...」

Natsuki
「I mean, I didn't mean it as a complaint. But it's just that we're calling it a "sea full of stars," but all we did was stick photos of constellations onto fish tanks, you know?」


all
Touko
「Not mincing words, are we, Camera-chan?」
Rikka
「Well, sorry for it looking cheap.」
Sora
「...It looks cheap like Natsu says when it's like this... but... Ryou.」

Sora
「...It looks cheap like Natsu says when it's like this... but...」

％Ｂ
「Right. We'll show you something awesome then, Segawa.」
all
We're still only halfway done, but I plug the constellations that we've finished setting up into an outlet.

％Ｂ
「Senpai, if you could handle those curtains.」
Misa
「Yes, I can.」
all
She sets up the blackout curtains.
The room darkens considerably once they start blocking the light from the windows.
Everything goes completely dark once Shinozaki turns off the room's lights.
％Ｂ
「Here goes, then.」
I turn on the LEDs.
Natsuki
「Woooow!」
The stars of the constellations light up, illuminating the vivid fish swimming through the tanks.

Marika
「Wow, it's so pretty～!」
Rikka
「Looks like they came out nicely.」
Touko
「I don't mean to toot my own horn, but I think these might be pretty amazing.」

Misa
「Yes. They're very beautiful, like something out of a dream! I'd like to watch this forever.」

％Ｂ
「This is great, Ousaka.」
Sora
「...Mmmhm.」
％Ｂ
「What do you think, Segawa? Still cheap?」
Natsuki
「...」
Misa
「Looks like she's too engrossed in her photography to have heard you.」
％Ｂ
「I-I guess that's fine...」
I don't blame her for being engrossed.
The "sea full of stars" is genuinely beautiful. It's creating a fantastic mood in the room.

％Ｂ
「Though to be honest, I didn't think it'd turn out this great. It's all thanks to Narusawa.」

Rikka
「What? ...Wh-Why me?」
％Ｂ
「What do you mean? You're the one who came up with this idea. You said we should use LEDs to light up the constellations.」

Rikka
「Oh... B-But Ousaka-san was the one who had the original idea...」
Sora
「...Tou did a lot too. You need to have a good feel for drawing the constellations. Tou did all of it.」


Touko
「It's not that big a deal. Though I guess it turned out pretty good?」

Misa
「Regardless, I'm glad we asked the three of you to do this. Thank you so very much for letting us see such a wonderful sight.」


Touko
「Mm...」
Rikka
「Well... I didn't have anything else to do anyway...」
Sora
「...」
The three of them look a little embarrassed at the earnest thanks.
％Ｂ
「I need to say it too. Thanks, guys.」
I raise my hand toward them.
I exchange high-fives with the three of them. Yukimura looks bashful, Narusawa embarrassed, and Ousaka expressionless.

all
I wish they'd act a little happier about it...
％Ｂ
「Phew... Look at the time.」
I've been doing some CAD software work for a while now, but I'm pretty tired.
I look outside. The sun went down a while ago.
％Ｂ
「Ughh～ ...I'm hungry.」
Now that I think about it, I haven't eaten since lunch. I'm starving.

％Ｂ
「Let's clean up a bit first...」
I gather up the polystyrene boards and balsa wood.
Taking proper care of your materials is important for doing good work.\n\r
...That's right. I've been working on what I want to display along with the tanks.
％Ｂ
「And I gotta make sure I keep these pristine.」
I carefully put away the blueprints for Marinpia Shionagi I've borrowed from Azuma-san.

％Ｂ
「I definitely have to make it in time. And it's gotta be perfect.」

Just look at what Ousaka and the others made.
I can't let myself lose to them.
％Ｂ
「But before that...」
I pull out my phone.
I start up the relevant app and select a specific someone.
I was planning on talking to her today, but it's gotten late.
...I got a little too focused on my work.
But it's important, so I need to tell her.
Is she awake?
She's awake... right?
Misa
『Hello, this is Okihara.』
The call connects after about three dial tones.
I can hear Misa-senpai's voice. She sounds a little more carefree than usual.
％Ｂ
「Oh... Good evening. This is ％Ｂ.」
Misa
『Hehe... Yes, good evening. You surprised me a little...』

％Ｂ
「I'm sorry. Is this a bit too late in the day?」
Misa
『Oh, not at all. I'm fine. I was just relaxing a little on my bed.』

％Ｂ
「I didn't know you liked to relax like that. I feel like I've learned something new about you.」

Misa
『Yes, I am relaxing～ ...I'm aaaall limp. I was just in the bath earlier, and I ended up quite tired...』


％Ｂ
「You got tired from taking a bath?」
Misa
『Yes, it's more work than you might expect. My hair is quite long, after all...』

％Ｂ
「Ah, I see.」
I could see how that could be tiring.
All the shampoo, the washing, the conditioner... It's a lot of effort that guys could never really understand.

Misa
『And it's another thing altogether to dry it with the hair dryer. It takes about thirty minutes.』

％Ｂ
「That long?」
Misa
『Yes, though I read books as I do so.』
％Ｂ
「Oh really... I didn't know it was so much work to maintain long hair.」
Misa
『I occasionally think cutting it short may be nice...』

％Ｂ
「Oh... But I think you look very cute with long hair, Misa-senpai.」
Misa
『...Eheheeeh.』
Misa
『I won't cut it, then.』
She giggles happily over the line.
She sounds relaxed, and very comfortable.
％Ｂ
「So anyway. There's something I wanted to ask you about...」

Misa
『Yes, what would that be?』
％Ｂ
「Is there anything you want at the moment?」
Misa
『Anything I want...? Let's see... Perhaps a European sea sturgeon, since those cannot be brought into Japan due to international ordinance...』


％Ｂ
「No, something that doesn't have to do with international issues... Something that could be obtained commercially.」

Misa
『Something that can be obtained... commercially... Oh! ...There is one thing. I would like a "J-BP015"!』


％Ｂ
「...I'm sorry?」
...Yet another mystery term...
Misa
『"J-BP015" is a model number! It's a big stuffed jellyfish toy! There were several sold for a limited period of time at Marinpia...』


％Ｂ
「Oh, I get it. It's "J" for jellyfish.」
Misa
『It's the 15th in the "Big Puppet" line. It was much more popular than the earlier ones, and sold out very quickly... I wanted one very badly, but I could not obtain one.』


％Ｂ
「Do they not sell them anymore?」
Misa
『No... Since Marinpia closed down...』
％Ｂ
「I see...」
Hmm. They don't sell them anymore...
Maybe I'd have a chance of finding one if I looked on auction sites?
Misa
『Why are you asking about that?』
％Ｂ
「What are you talking about? It's almost your birthday.」

July 24th, the day after tomorrow, is her birthday.
Misa
『Oh! ...You remembered?』
％Ｂ
「Of course I did. I wanted to celebrate it, so...」
Misa
『Oh my... How wonderful! Thank you so very much! So that means...』

％Ｂ
「Yes, it means exactly that.」
We can celebrate her birthday together, just the two of...
Misa
『You're going to throw me a birthday party!』
％Ｂ
「...What?」
Misa
『You're holding a birthday party for me... That makes me so happy!』

％Ｂ
「Oh, uh, that's not what I meant...」
Misa
『...? When it comes to birthdays, aren't birthday parties a must...?』

...She can't be serious.
％Ｂ
「Well... I mean, that's fine too, of course... but um, I thought maybe we could go on a date, since it's a special occasion.」

Misa
『A date...? A date...』
A brief moment of blank silence.
Misa
『Oh! ...I-I see～』
She nods along over the line, apparently having gotten what I'm getting at.
Misa
『W-Well that... I must say, sounds very wonderful...』
％Ｂ
「O-Oh, no... I'm glad you think so. We can settle on the agenda over LIME later.」

Misa
『Y-Yes! ...I would love to...! I'm very much looking forward to it! Oh! ...I will do all of the proper preparations too!』


It's kinda funny listening to her being so flustered.
％Ｂ
「Then, um, I hope I can make that day fun for you.」
Misa
『L-Likewise! I also hope I can do the same for you...!』
I bet she's bowing her head on the other end of the line.
We keep up that weird formalness until we hang up.
Misa-senpai's so cute.
I want her to have lots of fun on her birthday.
％Ｂ
「A big stuffed jellyfish toy...」
I sit back down in front of my computer and start tapping away.
％Ｂ
「...A limited run of one hundred? I dunno if I'll be able to find one then... No hits on auction sites either...」


Maybe I won't be able to get one?
But...
％Ｂ
「It's not like I've got anything to lose by looking!」
