Misa
「Hmm...」
all
％Ｂ
「Yooo.」
Natsuki
「Hellooo.」
Marika
「Oh, 
Hino-kun, Segawa-san.
hi, you two.
」
I've come to the old school building's chemistry classroom to help with preparing for the festival.
all
Misa
「Hmm... Mmmhh...」
Okihara-senpai hasn't even realized we're here. She's frowning in front of a specific water tank.

all
％Ｂ
「What's wrong with Senpai?」
Marika
「She apparently doesn't know the name of one of the fish we caught yesterday. She's been like that this whole time.」

％Ｂ
「Huh, I'm surprised there's any fish she doesn't know the name of.」
all
I walk up to Okihara-senpai.
％Ｂ
「Hello, Senpai.」
Misa
「What? Oh... Yes, hello. I apologize. I hadn't realized that the two of you were here.」

％Ｂ
「So which one's the fish that even you don't know the name of?」
Misa
「That would be this one. I believe it to be in the family Scorpaenidae...」

There's a single, small fish swimming around in the tank.
Natsuki
「Did we discover a new species, maybe?」
Misa
「Hmm, that would be rather unlikely... I believe it is simply that I am not familiar with it. I apologize. I clearly have much more to learn.」

Marika
「Should we go borrow some field guides from the library?」
Misa
「Yes, let's do that.」
Natsuki
「Oh, we'll go borrow them, then.」
％Ｂ
「...We?」
Natsuki
「I wanna borrow some books too, so we'll just go get them. You need fish field guides, right?」

Misa
「May I ask you to do so, then?」
all
Natsuki
「Suuure can. All right then, let's go.」
％Ｂ
「...Figured you were including me.」
Natsuki
「Of course I was. You're my assistant. And field guides are heavy, so you wouldn't want to make a frail maiden like myself carry all that weight, would you?」


％Ｂ
「Frail, uh huh... Sure, let's go with that.」
all
％Ｂ
「...These are heavy... and they don't balance well...」
Natsuki
「That's just how field guides are. Make sure you don't drop them.」

％Ｂ
「Help me so I don't, then.」
Natsuki
「I've got my own books to carry. Two of them, even.」
％Ｂ
「Right, that's true. Forgot that you claimed your hands were full 'cause of those.」

Natsuki
「I can't carry anything heavier than a camera.」
％Ｂ
「What if you had a twenty-kilo camera?」
Natsuki
「If it's a camera, I can hold it.」
％Ｂ
「...I'm not okay with this...」
Natsuki
「C'mon, don't wobble around like that, it's dangerous... Wait, huh? There's someone wobbling around over there.」

all
％Ｂ
「Aah?」
_00cutinBS
Segawa points at a familiar-looking girl wearing a hoodie, wobbling as she walks.

％Ｂ
「Ousaka?」
_00cutinBS
Her shoulders jerk in response to my voice.
She turns, and─
Thudthudthud...
The stack of books Ousaka was carrying tumbles onto the floor.
Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「Uh... S-Sorry, I must've surprised you.」
I look at the books all over the floor. They're all about stars and space.

Natsuki
「Are you doing research for the Tanabata Festival too, Sora?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
Natsuki
「Then let's all do our research together in the old school building. Marika and Misa-san are there too, so it'll be fun.」

Sora
「...*nod*」
Natsuki
「Mhm, okay then. Let's pick up those books and get going.」
all
Segawa picks up one of the books off the floor...
And places it on top of the books I'm carrying.
Thud...
％Ｂ
「...Hey?」
Sora
「...」
Ousaka follows Segawa's lead and places another one of her books on top of my stack. 

Thud...
％Ｂ
「...Hey?」
Thud... 
Thud... 
Thud... 
Thud.
％Ｂ
「Wha... I-I can't... I can't see in front of me...」
Natsuki
「It'll be fine. Just move in the direction of our voices.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
"Our voices"...? But one of you barely even talks!
％Ｂ
「Got here... without incident...」
Natsuki
「Great work, great work. There were a few scary moments there.」
％Ｂ
「The stairs were terrifying...」
Misa
「Thank you so very much for bringing this many!」
Natsuki
「Oh no, you're very welcome!」
％Ｂ
「...Not okay with this...」
all
Marika
「Ousaka-san, you came too. Are those books for research for the Tanabata Festival?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
Marika
「Let's read together, then.」
all
The others divide up into Team Fish and Team Star and start looking through the books.
I'm doing the best I can to lower the concentration of lactic acid that's built up in my arms.
I've been carrying lots of heavy stuff lately. There was that stuff when we went camping, the fish yesterday, and now those books today...

％Ｂ
「...」
...Now that I think about it, Ousaka seems like she already knows a lot about stars. I wonder if there's still anything to be gained for her by reading books?

I walk up to her.
She's got several books stacked up in front of her, and it looks like she's taking notes while reading one of them.

all
I grab one of the books off the stack and look at the cover.
％Ｂ
「"Constellations and Mythology"... This is for the Tanabata Festival, right?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「I always thought you knew everything when it came to the stars, but I guess even you need books like this?」

Sora
「...Space has no limit. Infinite possibilities, and there's still ongoing analysis. Reading is necessary to take in new knowledge. You could say there are as many opportunities for learning as there are books.」


％Ｂ
「R-Right... I guess so...」
She's always so talkative when it comes to stars...
And her word choices are kinda sophisticated too...
％Ｂ
「Make sure you keep things easy to understand for the display, all right? You gotta make it so anyone and everyone can understand it and take interest.」


Sora
「...*nod*」
Sora
「The display's theme is constellations and mythology. Things like fortune-telling and short stories are familiar to everyone, so I think it'll be easy for beginners to understand too.」

％Ｂ
「Huh, I didn't know you put that much thought into the theme. You're amazing.」

Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, I think everyone would be interested in constellations and mythology. Even I know a few things.」

Sora
「...Like?」
％Ｂ
「Uhh, like the relationship between Scorpio and Orion. I think Scorpio's supposed to be the scorpion that killed Orion.」

％Ｂ
「That's why Orion sets in the western sky to run away when Scorpio rises in the east... That's right, right?」

Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「How's that?」
I grin confidently at her.
Ousaka's expression changes a little. Maybe she's feeling a little competitive.
Sora
「...Capricorn's lower body is a fish.」
％Ｂ
「Huh? Uhh... Oh yeah, I think I've seen drawings like that, now that you mention it. But why's it a fish?」

Sora
「...The gods were holding a banquet. Then, a monster suddenly appeared before them. The gods were surprised, and transformed into animals to escape. The shepherd god Pan escaped into a river.」


Sora
「In order to do so, he transformed his upper body into a goat to run on land, and his lower body into a fish... is how the story goes.」

％Ｂ
「Huh, really? I've never heard that story. Sounds like the gods were pretty scatterbrained.」

Sora
「...At the same time, the goddess of beauty, Aphrodite, and her son Eros also escaped into the river.」

％Ｂ
「Oh, I've heard those names before.」
Sora
「...They transformed into fish to escape the monster. They tied their bodies together with thread so they wouldn't be separated, and their forms became a constellation. That's Pisces.」


％Ｂ
「Huh... I get it. That explains why there are two fish in Pisces. I always wondered, but now I know.」

％Ｂ
「Looks like I can't beat you when it comes to stars.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「Any other interesting stories?」
Sora
「...Do you know what a centaur is?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. It's a kind of creature from mythology that has the upper body of a human and the lower body of a horse, right?」

％Ｂ
「They come up in movies and stuff too. They always come help the main character beat the enemy.」

Sora
「...That's just in movies. Centaurs are supposed to be savages who attack humans.」

％Ｂ
「Huh, that's unexpected...」
Sora
「...But a centaur named Chiron was the one exception. Chiron was an exceptional scholar and tactician, and he was kind. He was admired by many. The hero Hercules was said to have been raised by Chiron.」


％Ｂ
「Chiron's so cool! So then the centaurs that appear in movies are based on Chiron?」

Sora
「...Once upon a time, Hercules battled with centaurs. Hercules loosed arrows tipped with the poison of a hydra, which would instantly kill whoever it hit, at the centaurs.」


％Ｂ
「He was totally trying to massacre them. Hercules was terrifying...」
Sora
「...One of the arrows hit Chiron, and he died instantly.」
％Ｂ
「Wha...!?」
Sora
「...After his death, Chiron climbed to the heavens and became a constellation. That's Sagittarius.」

％Ｂ
「Chiron totally didn't deserve to die there! And he got killed by Hercules, the kid he raised... He might've become a constellation, but I don't really know if it was worth it.」


Sora
「...Was it interesting?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. It's even more interesting 'cause it's constellations I know about. I bet people'll really like it if you could tell stories like that at the festival too.」


Sora
「...*nod*」
Ousaka nods in satisfaction.
all
I wonder how things are going with Team Fish.
Have they figured out the name of the fish yet?
％Ｂ
「How are things going? Do you know what that fish is?」
I call out to Senpai as she's looking through one of the field guides.
Misa
「Yes, thanks to your help. This is a fish of order Scorpaeniformes, family Agonidae, Occella iburia. It is known in common Japanese as a "saburou."」

％Ｂ
「Saburou? Is that its actual name?」
Misa
「It appears so. It apparently normally resides in the deep sea. We must have caught it after it just happened to come up to the shallows.」


％Ｂ
「I see...」
Marika
「Imagine if there was a fish in the same family called Shirou.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, come on. People don't name these things like jokes―」
Misa
「Why yes, there is a Shirou.」
％Ｂ
「Seriously!?」
Misa
「It appears that saburou reside on the Pacific Ocean side of Japan, and shirou reside to the north, in the Sea of Japan. I have read that they are very similar, which makes them difficult to discriminate between.」


Marika
「Wow, there really is a Shirou... That's kind of funny.」
Misa
「I would like to display as many rare fish such as this one as I am able for the festival.」

％Ｂ
「I see...」
all
There's Ousaka's stories about constellations and mythology, and there's Okihara-senpai's mini marine zoo.
They're both looking like they'll be a lot of fun.
Natsuki
「...」
％Ｂ
「Hm...?」
Segawa's off on her own, silently looking at one of the books she borrowed from the library.

I sneak up behind her to take a look. Segawa's book also has pictures of fish in it.\n\r

All of the other books she borrowed also seem to be about fish.
％Ｂ
「What's all this for? You got interested in fish or something?」
Natsuki
「Huh? Uhh, well...」
She looks a little flustered after I suddenly talk to her.
Natsuki
「I dunno, I was just thinking that they sure looked tasty.」
％Ｂ
「You're kidding... You're one of those people who say that at aquariums, aren't you?」
Natsuki
「But don't they actually look like they'd be good eating? There's always huge shrimp and crab and stuff. Don't you imagine just how much meat they've got packed inside?」


％Ｂ
「Uh... Yeah, you're right, I think that when I see crabs too.」
Natsuki
「Right? Riiight? I bet they're really well fed because they're taken care of frequently too. I bet they're delicious. Yeah, they have to be!」


...?
She seems like she's desperately trying to hide something.
But I guess I'll just go with it for now.
％Ｂ
「Yeah, aquariums are kinda like when you see fish tanks at sushi places. I bet the small ones would taste pretty good if you just fried them whole.」

Natsuki
「Oh no, live eating is what's in for those, you know～」
％Ｂ
「Parboiling or roasting's good too. Hey, Shinozaki, Senpai. What's your favorite─」

all
Marika & Misa
「...」
I turn around to see the two of them standing there with serious faces, putting themselves between us and the fish tanks.

％Ｂ
「Uh... We're not going to eat the fish here, okay...?」
I try to get them to relax, but they just keep standing guard over the fish tanks.
