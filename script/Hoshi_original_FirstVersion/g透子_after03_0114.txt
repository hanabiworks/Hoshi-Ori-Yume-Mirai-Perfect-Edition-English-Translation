「Huh? Ueda-san's quitting?」
Firm Staff A
「Yeah, seems like it. It's gonna be pretty rough to lose a planner at this time of year...」

It's painful when coworkers leave.
It's only been a year, but Ueda-san's still someone I've experienced pain and joy with, and he was skilled too... His loss will probably be painful for the firm.

「Mr. Azuma, are you planning on recruiting a new staff member?」
Azuma
「We'll keep going as is for now. I'm actually in the middle of interviewing someone new right now. We won't need to recruit anyone if they're hired.」


Firm Staff A
「Huh, are they experienced?」
Azuma
「No, they're someone who only just graduated university last year. They're currently studying a field that we want in our firm, so I'm expecting good things of them... but we'll see.」


So that means... they're the same age as me.
I feel nostalgic when I think about how things were like for me last year.
％Ｂ
「I see, so I'm finally going to have a junior coworker... It feels a bit strange.」

Azuma
「You're barely past a chick. You can act the part of a senior staff member once you're able to do good work on your own.」


％Ｂ
「Th-That's not what I meant! Hey, what's so funny!?」

Firm Staff A
「Hahaha, no, I was just laughing because you looked so happy! Having a junior coworker's not all it's cracked up to be! You'll always be worrying about them catching up to you!」


Azuma
「Just like you, yeah. You two might be swapping desks next year, you know.」

Firm Staff A
「Wha, Mr. Azuma!? That wouldn't take just a year, right!?」

Azuma
「...」
Firm Staff A
「Why aren't you saying anything!? Listen here, 

Hino, 

I'm not giving up this spot, all right!?」
Azuma
「Speaking of which... I got the results for that design competition last month. You won. Good job.」

％Ｂ
「Did I really!? All right! I really thought I could do it...!」

I'm glad I put in all that effort!
This is the first time my work's been acknowledged since I started working here!
Azuma
「I'll have to reward you for placing
, Hino

. How about you participate in the planning phase for our next project?」

％Ｂ
「Can I really!? I'd love to!」
Firm Staff A
「But I only got to do that in my third year! Isn't that a little too soon!?」

Azuma
「Don't worry, I'm not expecting too much from you. Though I am expecting you to surprise me with a young person's unique perspective.」

％Ｂ
「I'll do my very best! I can't wait to receive your guidance!」

I'll be able to give Touko some good news before we find out if she passed her exam.
I hope she's just as happy about this as I am...!
