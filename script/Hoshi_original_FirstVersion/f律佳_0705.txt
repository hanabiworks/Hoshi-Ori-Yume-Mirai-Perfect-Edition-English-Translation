Rikka's coming over to study with me today.
She doesn't know where I live, so I'm waiting for her at the spot where our paths diverge when we walk home from school.

We're not going on a date, but I'm still meeting up with my girlfriend.
I've fixed my hair and put on decent-looking clothes, and I've shown up ten minutes before the time we agreed on.

Rikka
「Oh... Good morning.」
Rikka's already there waiting for me.
Her expression lights up a bit when she sees me.
％Ｂ
「Morning, Rikka. Sorry, did you wait long?」
Rikka
「No, I just got here early. And besides, this spot's close to where I live anyway.」

Rikka
「More importantly, wasn't it a lot of trouble for you to come all the way here?」

％Ｂ
「Not at all. In fact, I was crazy excited on my way here 'cause I knew I'd get to see you.」

Rikka
「Aauuuh～ ...I was... really excited... while I was waiting too.」
Her neatly braided hair swings in her embarrassment.

Rikka's outfit is as cute as ever, but I spot one thing that's different from usual.

％Ｂ
「You're wearing it?」
It's the necklace I gave her as a present.
The moonstones glimmer at the base of her neck.
Rikka
「You gave it to me as a present. I actually wish I could always wear it, but I think it would be confiscated if I wore it at school.」


％Ｂ
「Thanks. I'm happy you're treasuring it.」
I'm so glad I bought it for her.
％Ｂ
「Well, there's no point in just standing here, so let's get going.」
I hold out my hand to her, and she happily takes it.
％Ｂ
「We're almost at my place.」
We're walking toward my house.
It'd be quicker and more efficient to take the bus, but we've chosen to just enjoy this for longer.

We walk past Shinozaki's house, and the outer gates of my house come into view.
％Ｂ
「Here we are. Welcome to the ％Ａ household. Though it's just a normal new house.」

Rikka
「So this is your house...」
She's staring up at my house intently.
I don't think it's that unusual of a design...
Rikka
「Your parents still aren't back, are they?」
％Ｂ
「No, my dad still can't really seem to wrap up his work over in Kanagawa. So it'll be just us today―」

Ah, right.
I get it now. It's not that my house is interesting. She was nervous.
％Ｂ
「It'll be just us, but uh... I won't suddenly try any funny stuff or anything.」

Rikka
「...What?」
％Ｂ
「Huh? I thought you were worried about something like that. Was I wrong?」
Rikka
「I'm not thinking about that! ...You pervert.」
Rikka
「I already know that you treasure me... I was just a little nervous about going to my boyfriend's house for the first time.」
％Ｂ
「O-Oh, really.」
Hearing her say it out loud's making me embarrassed too.
Yeah, I remember I was crazy nervous the first time I went to Rikka's house.

Rikka
「...But it's a bit of a shock as your girlfriend to hear you won't try anything funny. I'd at least be fine with kissing at any time...」


％Ｂ
「You sure? Like here?」
Rikka
「Uh...」
％Ｂ
「I could totally hear you talking to yourself, you know.」
Rikka
「...! No! Not here!」
％Ｂ
「"At any time."」
Rikka
「...You should hold yourself to some standards.」
％Ｂ
「Yes, you're very correct...」
It's pretty rough hearing that it's fine one moment, and not fine the next. I really want to kiss her, you know.

I swallow down my desires and let Rikka in.
％Ｂ
「My room's right upstairs.」
Rikka
「Oh, could I put the ingredients for lunch in your fridge before that?」

She has ground beef, shrimp, onions, carrots, and breadcrumbs in her large bag.
The ingredients for the ground beef steak et cetera that I requested yesterday.
％Ｂ
「I'll show you the kitchen first, then.」
Rikka
「Your kitchen's big and seems convenient.」
％Ｂ
「I haven't really paid much attention to it, but my mom was apparently on top of things for it when we were building the house.」

％Ｂ
「You can use anything you want here when you're cooking.」
Rikka
「Thank you. But...」
Rikka's looking dumbfoundedly at the contents of the fridge.
Rikka
「I only see eggs, cabbage, and red pickled ginger...」
％Ｂ
「That's from when I made okonomiyaki the other day.」
Rikka
「The cabbage is a bit wilted...」
％Ｂ
「That's... probably 'cause I forgot to put it away and left it out overnight.」

Rikka
「You haven't even put the cabbage in the crisper. You should at least take advantage of this nice fridge you have.」

％Ｂ
「Isn't it the same no matter where you put it?」
Rikka
「Each of the compartments has different temperatures for different food. How have you been living on your own like this?」

％Ｂ
「I just made rice and then figured it out from there.」
Rikka
「You're so nonchalant when it comes to food... Are all boys like this? ...You need to eat properly.」


％Ｂ
「You're kinda like a mom, Rikka.」
Rikka
「Wha... A-A mom...? Mmmhh... I am your girlfriend, you know.」

％Ｂ
「Agh, I meant! I meant it as in you're good at home stuff! You know, like you'd make a good bride someday!」

Rikka
「Auuuh... A bride... Geez... Let's just leave it at that, then.」

She blushes and places the ingredients into the mostly empty fridge.
Rikka
「Let's go grocery shopping after we eat lunch. I'll teach you some easy recipes.」

％Ｂ
「That'd be helpful.」
There's a limit to how much I can accomplish by just referencing cookbooks and websites.
all
This is my first time inviting a girl into my room at all, much less a girlfriend.
I vacuumed it this morning, opened the windows to ventilate, and prepared a cushion for Rikka to sit on too.

Rikka sits down on the cushion at the glass table and stares right at me.

...Kinda too intently.
％Ｂ
「Uh, something on my face?」
Rikka
「Oh... I'm sorry. I thought it would be rude to look around too much. But I didn't really know where else to look, so...」


％Ｂ
「You can just relax. Think of it as your own room.」
Rikka
「I can't. It smells like a boy... like you...」
％Ｂ
「O-Oh, I see. What does that smell like?」
I'm curious, since it doesn't seem like she dislikes it. 
Rikka
「Like you, I guess.」
％Ｂ
「I don't really know what I smell like, though.」
Rikka
「But that's the only way I can describe it. What do you think when you walk into my room, then?」

％Ｂ
「Hmm～ ...That it smells like you, I guess.」
Rikka
「See? But when I'm surrounded by your smell, it feels like there's something strong there to protect me... It's comforting and puts me at ease.」


Rikka
「Hehe. I called you a pervert before, but I guess I'm a pervert too.」

The way she giggles is so cute.
I lean over the glass table and place my hands on her shoulders.
Rikka
「...Huh? Ah... Nmh... Hah, chu...」
％Ｂ
「Chu... Now's fine, right? No one's watching...」
Rikka
「Hahh... afh... We're going to study... aren't we... Nn, nnh... Chu, hamh...」

％Ｂ
「I'll make up for it in effort... once we're done kissing...」
Rikka
「Geez... What am I going to do with you... Hah, nnchu... Chu, nh... Chu, chu...」
Rikka
「...Mh, chu... Hahh, fh... Mmchu... Chu... nnhahh... Okay, done. Let's start studying.」

％Ｂ
「All right! I'm pumped! Let's do this!」
Rikka
「Hehe.」
all
I maintained above-average grades before transferring here, so I just had her teach me the types of questions and structures the exams tend to have at our school.

I'm glad there don't seem to be too many differences between the schools, though there are a few things.

I think I'll be able to at least avoid failing at this rate.
Rikka made a ground beef steak meal with fried eggs and shrimp for lunch, and we had a good time grocery shopping after that.
She even made me dinner afterward.
％Ｂ
「What the heck, this is amazing!」
Rikka
「Isn't it? You can make a perfectly good meal out of leftovers in your fridge.」

She fried a thin layer of egg, cut it into thin slices, and mixed it together with finely chopped red pickled ginger.

It's simple, but it's absolutely delicious on rice.
％Ｂ
「It's easy to make, and I could probably eat this every day.」
Rikka
「No, you can't. You won't get enough nutrients if you only eat this. You need to consider a balanced diet.」

％Ｂ
「Sounds like a lot of work thinking up a meal every day, even if I do get good at cooking.」

Rikka
「Hehe. That'll start getting fun eventually.」
％Ｂ
「I wonder if that day'll ever come... Man, I wouldn't have to worry about that if you could just come over every day... Oh.」

I realize I've said something embarrassing.
I look toward Rikka... and as expected, she's bright red.

Rikka
「...」
％Ｂ
「Oh, uh, that was kind of a slip of the tongue or...」
Rikka
「Does that mean you don't really think that?」
She glares at me.
％Ｂ
「No, it doesn't. I want that to happen in the future some day, of course. But it's like, we're still students, so it's a bit early.」

％Ｂ
「We've only just started dating, so I think it'd be nice if we could think about stuff like that from now on. What I mean is, uh...」


I'm starting to lose track of what I'm trying to say.
Rikka
「Hehe. You're right, it's definitely a little too early for us to get married. I can't really imagine it myself just yet either.」

％Ｂ
「Oh, did you try to imagine it?」
Rikka
「No. I felt really ticklish earlier... Or more like, I was happy.」

Rikka
「Because I could really feel that you're thinking about our future together.」

Rikka
「I... also think it'd be nice if I could build things up slowly with you from now on.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah.」
This is making me blush a bit.
％Ｂ
「Hey, Rikka. Wanna go on a date after exams? We haven't gone on a proper one since we started dating, right?」

Rikka
「A date... Hehe, mhm! Yes, I do!」
％Ｂ
「It's a date, then. Aghh, but after exams... That's a ways off...」

Our final exams start the day after tomorrow on Monday, and end on Friday.
Which means our date would be in a week.
Saving the fun for later's got a nice ring to it, but I also wanna go on a date right away...

Rikka
「...Hey. Turn this way a bit.」
％Ｂ
「Hm?」
Rikka
「Chu...」
％Ｂ
「Wha...」
My eyes go wide from how sudden it is.
Rikka
「Be patient with this for now. I'm looking forward to our date too. Let's do our best on our exams.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah!」
I've gotta get good grades now.
I'm more motivated than ever before to study.
