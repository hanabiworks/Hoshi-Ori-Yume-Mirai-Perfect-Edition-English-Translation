It's been a day, but that's all. Nothing's changed.

％Ｂ
「Sorry, everyone. If I had designed things more properly...」

Natsuki
「You don't need to worry about it. You've never built a planetarium before. It's normal to make mistakes.」


Natsuki
「The issue is that we only have four more days...」
all
％Ｂ
「...Yeah. I thought about what we should do last night...」

But I couldn't come up with any good ideas.
It was nothing but me being frantic.
Misa
「...It seems there may be no option but to use the prototype we initially made.」


Touko
「Mmm... Seems like it... There's no other option, is there?」
all
％Ｂ
「...」
I already know that's our only option.
I already know that, but my heart won't admit it.
％Ｂ
「You guys all saw that starry sky yesterday. Our Mk. 1 doesn't even begin to compare.」

There's an obvious difference between the two skies.
I'm reluctant to go back to the first one at this point.
Rikka
「Then... Do you have any other ideas?」
％Ｂ
「I...」
all
I know.
I know that all I'm doing is pining for something that we don't have.
But, but still...
Marika
「A-Anyway, let's try testing out the first one again! We might still be able to make some improvements.」

Marika steps in to mediate, sets up the first planetarium, and turns it on.

all
Dim light fills the darkened room.
But all it does is amaze me how different it is from that amazing sky from yesterday.
I was decently moved when we first saw it... but now this looks like just some regular old lamp to me.

We can't use this.
But...
I can't figure out what we should do...
Marika
「What to do～」
I went home still dejected.
Marika came home with me, worried for my sake.
Marika
「I wonder if there's anything we can do to improve the first one.」
％Ｂ
「Hmm... Honestly, I think that'd be hard. It'd be hard to make any more pinholes with its size...」


Marika
「I wonder what we should do...」
％Ｂ
「Yeah...」
all
I ransack my brain again as I look over the blueprint.
But I can't think of anything good.
％Ｂ
「I feel really sorry for everyone.」
The only things that come to mind are pathetic apologies.
Marika
「Oh...」
％Ｂ
「I dragged Ousaka and Okihara-senpai into this, got everyone to help... We were so close, but it's all ruined because of that mistake...」

Marika
「...」
％Ｂ
「This happens a lot. I make a mistake when it's really important, and...」

Marika
「...Ryousuke-kun.」
Marika
「...Um.」
％Ｂ
「Hm?」
Marika
「Here I gooo～ Haaaaaaaaaahhh!?」

％Ｂ
「Wha... Whoaaaa!?」
A body press outta nowhere!?
％Ｂ
「Gueh!?」
I frantically catch her as she flies toward me.
But I still crumple back onto the floor, because of how sudden it was.
Marika
「A-Ahahahaha～ ...Sorry for doing that out of the blue...」
％Ｂ
「C-Come on...」
She's giving me a bit of a pained smile on top of me.
Marika
「Umm～ ...It's okay.」
％Ｂ
「Okay...? What is?」
Marika
「I'm sure it'll be okay.」
Marika
「Because you're someone who can pull through.」
％Ｂ
「Marika...」
She looks right into my eyes.
There's no doubt, no hesitation in her eyes.
I see.
She's... encouraging me.
Marika
「I'll help. So let's think about it together, okay?」

％Ｂ
「...Yeah.」
all
She's right.
I shouldn't be complaining or apologizing.
Regrets won't change a thing.
Marika
「Do you think we could make the second one again? It'll be the third one, so I think we're all pretty good at it now. Maybe we could manage it if we worked hard～」


％Ｂ
「Yeah. I tried thinking along those lines too, since that seemed like the only option. But there's not nearly enough time.」

There's four days until the festival.
Three whole days if you don't count today.
％Ｂ
「We might be good at it by now, but if we're gonna try to make nearly ten thousand more pinholes in just three days... I don't think we'd make it in time even if we didn't sleep.」


Marika
「Hmm～ If only we could split it all up between us.」
％Ｂ
「Right. Exactly.」
％Ｂ
「We can only split that sphere into halves. So we can't all work on it at the same time.」

Marika
「Would we make it in time if we could all work on it at the same time? We could cut the hemispheres into more pieces, for example...」

％Ｂ
「That'd be ideal, but I don't think we'd be able to recombine the parts. It wouldn't be stable.」

Marika
「It was a good idea, too～」
all
％Ｂ
「Yeah, if we could split that into four parts... Or no, maybe more? I'm pretty sure the biggest polyhedral we could get would be a regular icosahedron...」


％Ｂ
「...」
％Ｂ
「...A regular icosahedron!?」
Marika
「Wah, you scared me!」
％Ｂ
「W-Wait, Marika, sorry, show me the blueprint!」
Marika
「H-Here you go!」
I look hard at the blueprint again.
％Ｂ
「I get it... I'm such an idiot... It isn't just the heat problem. I didn't even realize something this simple...」


Marika
「Wait... Did you think of something?」
％Ｂ
「Thanks, Marika. I think we might be able to make it in time, thanks to you.」

Marika
「Wow...!」
Her face lights up.
all
I immediately get to work giving form to my idea in my sketchbook.
I don't know if we'll really make it in time with this...
But we'll just have to try!
