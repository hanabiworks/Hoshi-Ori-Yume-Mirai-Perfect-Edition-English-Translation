「Hmm...」
I flip back the curtain a bit.
I groan when I see outside.
The weather's supposed to be especially bad today.
I'll have to let everyone know.
【％Ｂ】「The weather forecast #Nsays it's supposed to #Nget stormier as the day #Ngoes on. So let's all #Nstay at home today.」
【Marika】「Yeah, it's dangerous.」
【Sora】「...Roger.」
【Sora】_st_0313
【Touko】「Same.」
【Touko】_st_0315
【Misa】「I also understand. Let #Nus all assemble again #Nafter the hurricane has #Npassed.」
【Misa】「Though I am slightly #Nworried about the fish #Ntanks...」
【％Ｂ】「The fish tanks?」
【Misa】「This hurricane is quite #Nlarge, so there may be #Na blackout... though I #Nthink it will be fine.」
【％Ｂ】「Let's keep an eye on #Nthe forecast. Either #Nway, let's all work on #Nwhat we can at home #Ntoday.」
Looks like Okihara-senpai's worried.
I put down my phone and look outside. The rain's gotten stronger.
％Ｂ
「Looks like the hurricane's here.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, it's Marika.」
I grab the phone that I just put down.

％Ｂ
「Hello? Something up?」
Marika
『You're going to do work at home today, right?』
％Ｂ
「Was planning on it. Time's precious.」
Marika
『I'll help, then. Two people are better than one, right?』
％Ｂ
「Yeah, but... There's a hurricane outside, you know.」
Marika
『It'll be fine, I'm close～ And the rain's not that bad yet. I'll go home before it gets too bad.』

％Ｂ
「You sure? I'll walk you home, then.」
Marika
『Okay! I'll be over in a bit, then!』
_smh_st_04
She hangs up after her happy response.
Knowing that I'll see her in a bit's getting my heart going.
Just seeing her makes me genuinely happy.
Marika
「Wow, it's so pretty～」
It's still far from complete, but we wanted to see how it looked. The stars actually look really good.

％Ｂ
「This is really something.」
I can't help but be impressed.
Marika
「Yeah, I think I might be getting a little emotional.」
％Ｂ
「C'mon now. We haven't even gotten a third of all the stars on there yet.」
Marika
「I think I might cry when it's done...」
％Ｂ
「That'd be overreacting. But it'd be great if we could make something that good.」

Thunk!
Marika
「Kyah...!?」
％Ｂ
「Wh-What was that just now? The wind?」
Marika
「Looks like it. It's really picked up.」
％Ｂ
「Oh man... Look at how far the trees are bending.」
Marika
「The wind's so strong... It's a little scary...」
Marika clings to me.
I can feel the warmth from her small body.
I gently pull her into my embrace.
Marika
「...Mhm.」
She leans against me and looks up at me.
Her eyes and lips look wet in the dim room.
I want to put her at ease. I lean down and...
all
And then my phone rings.
％Ｂ
「Sorry. I'm gonna get that real quick.」
Marika
「No, it's okay...」
I pull away from Marika, my face bright red.
all
It was a LIME message.
％Ｂ
「Oh, it's from Senpai.」
Marika
「Okihara-san?」
all
【Misa】「We just had a blackout #Nover here. Is #Neverything okay over by #Nyou?」
【％Ｂ】「We're fine over here. #NAre you all right?」
【Misa】「I'm fine. But I'm #Nworried about the tanks #Nat school, so I was #Nthinking I would go #Ncheck on them.」
％Ｂ
「Wha...?」
I look outside on reflex.
The wind's even stronger now. It's pretty much raining sideways.
Marika
「What's wrong? What did Okihara-san say?」
％Ｂ
「She says she's thinking of going to school 'cause she's worried about the fish tanks.」
Marika
「What? By herself? Isn't that dangerous?」
％Ｂ
「For sure.」
all
【％Ｂ】「Please wait. It'd be #Ndangerous to go by #Nyourself.」
【Misa】「But if the fans or #Npumps were to fail #Nbecause of a blackout, #Nit will affect the #Nfish... The worst-case #Nscenario may occur.」
【％Ｂ】「I'll go check up on them, then.」
【Misa】「What? But...」
【％Ｂ】「I'll report back from #Nschool. If there's #Nanything I need to do, #Nthen I'll do as you say #Nfrom there.」
【Misa】「...Will you be really #Nokay, ％Ｂ-san?」
【％Ｂ】「I'm a guy, and I've got #Nsome bulk to me.」
【Misa】「Bulk?」
【％Ｂ】「You're very lanky, so #Nyou'd get blown away by #Nthis wind. But I'll be #Nfine.」
【Misa】「...I understand (haha). #NThen I'd like to ask #Nyou to handle it, #N％Ｂ-san. Please be #Ncareful.」
【％Ｂ】「Roger that. I'll contact #Nyou again once I'm #Nthere.」
$$smh_OpenCHK
Now then. Things are getting pretty rough.
Marika
「You're... not going to go by yourself, are you?」
She was apparently watching our conversation from the side.
％Ｂ
「Yeah. It'd be dangerous to let Okihara-senpai go.」
Marika
「I'll come too, then. You'll need some help, right?」
％Ｂ
「What are you saying? No, you can't. I didn't let Okihara-senpai go 'cause it was dangerous. What'd be the point of letting you go after that?」


Marika
「Don't worry. I have you, Ryousuke-kun. You'll protect me, right?」

Marika
「Don't worry. I have you. You'll protect me, right?」

％Ｂ
「Well, yeah, I will...」
Marika
「And besides, I'm your girlfriend. It's natural for me to help my boyfriend.」

％Ｂ
「If you put it that way...」
Marika
「It's decided, then. I'll get ready right away.」
all
％Ｂ
「Uh...」
I feel like Marika's getting stronger and stronger.
The Marika I used to know who was always wheezing on the bed really doesn't exist anymore.

Marika
「Do you have raincoats～? I can go home real quick and get one if you don't! I think we have a waterproof flashlight too!」


％Ｂ
「Seriously. She's so dependable.」
I think I might be the one drawing strength from her now.
％Ｂ
「Whew, this rain's crazy!」
Marika
「We're getting wet even while wearing the raincoats～」
％Ｂ
「Seriously. We would've been done for if we were using umbrellas.」

The rain's seriously pelting us horizontally. 
And it's violently powerful.
I bet umbrellas would get ripped out of our hands in less than five minutes.
$$smh_OpenCHK
％Ｂ
「Phew... We're here.」
％Ｂ
「We won't be able to go home for a while like this... It's apparently only gonna get stronger.」
Marika
「It'd be dangerous to try to go home like this. I'll have to call my mom if this keeps up for too long...」


％Ｂ
「Yeah. Anyway, we need to check the tanks... but let's get changed first.」

Marika
「Oh, here. This is your change of clothes, Ryousuke-kun.」

Marika
「Oh, here. This is your change of clothes.」

Marika had even prepared a change of clothes for me, since she figured it wouldn't be good to stay wet.\n\r

She's so dependable. Like a really attentive wife.
Marika
「And I'll change too... Huh?」
She's digging through her bag concernedly.
％Ｂ
「What's wrong?」
Marika
「I might've forgotten my change of clothes...」
％Ｂ
「What? You forgot your own clothes?」
Marika
「Ahaha, looks like it.」
Apparently there was only one set of clothes.
It's just like Marika to think of others before herself.

％Ｂ
「But you'll get the chills like that. Here, change into mine for now.」

Marika
「No, I'll be okay. I've already prepared so it'll be okay if I'm wet.」

％Ｂ
「Prepared so it'll be okay if you're wet?」
all
She suddenly starts taking her clothes off while I'm puzzling that over.
％Ｂ
「H-Hey? You're not gonna get naked, are you...?」
I know we've already seen each other without so much as a thread on our bodies, so I might not really mind, but...\n\r

Wait, no! I do mind!
Marika
「Tadaaa♪」
％Ｂ
「...Wait, what? A swimsuit?」
Marika
「Yeah. I wore this underneath, because I knew I'd get wet anyway. It's easy-peasy this way, right?」

％Ｂ
「I-I see...」
Marika
「Huh? Is your face red?」
％Ｂ
「No, it's not...」
Marika's pale skin is a bit too dazzling.
My heart's pounding.
Seeing her in a bikini in a classroom is kinda new...
Marika
「...Oh. It'd be nice if you wouldn't look so much～」
She seems to have realized that this is actually pretty embarrassing too. She's blushing and fidgeting.\n\r

It's a really sexy sight.
And if she tells me not to look, this just makes me want to...
％Ｂ
「Wha...」
Marika
「Kyah...!?」
Our surroundings suddenly go dark.
％Ｂ
「A blackout?」
Marika
「Looks like it.」
I suddenly feel something warm on my arm.
Seems like Marika got scared and brought herself closer.
Squish...
I can feel a firm softness against my elbow.
This is... Marika's breasts... in her swimsuit, to boot...
％Ｂ
「D-Don't worry. I'm right here.」
I brush aside those thoughts. Now isn't the time for that.
Marika
「O-Okay...」
I compose myself after hearing her relieved-sounding voice.
％Ｂ
「You brought a flashlight, right?」
Marika
「Oh, yeah. I did.」
She pulls out a huge flashlight from her bag.
It's apparently a pretty legitimate one that her dad uses for work and stuff.

％Ｂ
「Oh, this is real bright. Anyway, let's go look at the tanks.」

We use the flashlight to look over the tanks.
Marika
「It's quiet... That means the pumps and stuff are stopped, right?」
all
％Ｂ
「This isn't good...」
We don't know how long this blackout might go on for.
The storm's only picking up momentum outside. It doesn't look like things will change anytime soon.

％Ｂ
「Let's let Okihara-senpai know for now.」
_smh_st_01
_smh_st_btn01
_SMH_ST_01
I call her with my phone.
_smh_st_02
_smh_st_btn02
_smh_st_02
_smh_st_btn05
Misa
『Hello? Okihara speaking!』
She picks up immediately.
She must've been anticipating a call from me.
％Ｂ
「This is ％Ａ. We just had a blackout over here too. The pumps and such are all stopped. What should we do? Please advise.」


Misa
『I understand. First, please locate the toolbox for the tanks.』

％Ｂ
「Toolbox...」
Marika
「Oh, isn't it this～?」
％Ｂ
「We've found it, Okihara-senpai.」
Misa
『There should be manual air pumps and battery-operated fans inside. Can you find them?』

％Ｂ
「Manual air pumps and battery-operated fans?」
Marika
「Let's see... Oh, these!」
Marika looks through the toolbox and finds the pumps and fans.
Misa
『Have you found them? Please do as I say with those. First...』


all
We follow Okihara-senpai's instructions to set the equipment up.

$$smh_OpenCHK
It's relatively simple work, but we're exhausted by the end. It's not something we're used to doing, and we had to do it a lot of times.

Marika
「I think we're finished with all of them?」
％Ｂ
「Though we'll have to make sure the air pressure doesn't go down too far, since the air pumps are manually operated.」

We'll have to be mindful of when the amount of air the pumps are outputting gets low, and adjust the pressure with the dials.

And we'll have to replace them once the air runs out completely too.
％Ｂ
「But I think we should be good for a while?」
Marika
「Phew...」
all
The two of us sink down onto the floor.
We end up leaning against each other.
Our sweaty skin sticks together.
It feels wet, but I don't mind Marika's sweat at all.
And Marika feels the same way about mine, judging from how she doesn't seem to mind it either.
％Ｂ
「Want some water?」
Marika
「Oh, I do～」
％Ｂ
「Man, you're so sweaty. Your hair's soaking wet.」

I dry off her hair with one of the sports towels we brought.
Marika
「Wawah... My hair's all crumply～ You're doing it rough on purpose, aren't you?」

％Ｂ
「What gave it away?」
Marika
「It's so obvious～ Geeez!」
She's puffed up, but she still looks like she's enjoying herself.
Marika
「It's really hot with all the windows shut and no air conditioning. Look, you're sweating a lot too.」

She wipes my sweat with the towel too.
Her soft breasts squeeze against me as she does so, because we're still up against each other.

％Ｂ
「H-Hey...」
Marika
「H-Huh? ...W-Wah～ It-It's gotten bigger, you know...」

％Ｂ
「I-I can't help it. You're so close...」

Marika
「Whaaat? It's my fault? It's because you're perverted, Ryousuke-kun... What are you going to do like that...?」


Marika
「Whaaat? It's my fault? It's because you're perverted... What are you going to do like that...?」


％Ｂ
「What do you mean, what am I gonna do... Isn't that obvious?」

Marika
「Oh...」
A seductive sound leaks out from her lips.
I can't take it anymore.
％Ｂ
「Marika...」
Marika
「Fueh...?」
The lights turn on just as I'm pulling her closer.
Suddenly having our embrace illuminated like that is ridiculously embarrassing.

Marika
「Looks like the blackout's over～ ...I wonder if it'll be okay now.」

We gently pull away amidst the awkwardness.
％Ｂ
「I think so, for now. But the rain's still going strong outside.」

all
It's still the same crazy rainstorm outside the window.
We won't know if another blackout might happen while the weather's like this.
Marika
「Yeah, we should keep an eye on these for a little longer. I should call my mom and tell her I'll be home late...」

all
She calls her house.
I go around and stop the manual air pumps in the meantime.
Marika
「She said I should let her know if the rain's too much for us to come home. She'll come pick us up in the car. And she said she'll handle things with my dad.」


％Ｂ
「That sounds great.」
Marika
「...I guess we won't have much to do for a while?」
％Ｂ
「Looks like it...」
Marika
「...」
％Ｂ
「...」
％Ｂ
「Wanna... take a bit of a break?」
Marika
「O-Okay...」
Marika brings herself close again.
My arousal from earlier comes roaring back in no time in response to the softness.
％Ｂ
「Isn't it hot being this close?」
Marika
「I'm fine～ Is it hot... for you?」
％Ｂ
「No... but if you stick close like this... I might not be able to control myself.」

Marika
「Yeah. Me neither...」
Marika's reply takes me by surprise.
Does that mean she wants to "do it" too?
％Ｂ
「Do you feel the same way?」
Marika
「N-No, I don't～ ...I'm not that dirty a girl, okay?」

％Ｂ
「Uh... Really? Sorry, I just...」

Marika
「Yeah, I don't. I just...」

％Ｂ
「Just?」
Marika
「I just love you so much, Ryousuke-kun... that I can't stop myself, that's all...」

Marika
「I just love you so much... that I can't stop myself, that's all...」

％Ｂ
「You mean...」
Marika says nothing more.
She falls silent and turns red.
Marika
「Anh...」
She makes a cute moan when I place my lips against hers.
Marika
「Hafhh... hauuh... Nh, slrp... Chu...」
She awkwardly tangles her tongue around mine.
It's a hurried, yet passionate kiss.
％Ｂ
「Are you sure... you're not feeling dirty right now too?」

Marika
「N-No, I'm not, but... It looks like you can't control yourself... and, I love you～ ...S-So... I don't really have any choice, so...」


％Ｂ
「I see... So it's my fault.」
Marika
「Y-Yeah, it is～」
Her childish excuse is kinda cute.
But she isn't wrong. I really don't think I can control myself anymore.
％Ｂ
「Marika...」
Marika
「Aahn...」
I pull her close, and Marika wraps her arms around me too.
Our skin is sticky with sweat and humidity, but I don't dislike it at all.

In fact, I just want us to stick together even more.
We hug each other tightly.

$$smh_OpenCHK
Marika
「Oh... It looks like the rain's letting up.」
She opens the window.
A warm, but refreshing breeze blows in.
％Ｂ
「You're right. Maybe the hurricane's passed?」
all
I check the weather on my phone.
％Ｂ
「Says it'll be clear 'til morning. Looks like it's passed.」

Must've been a fairly quick-moving hurricane.
Marika
「That's great～ So we don't need to worry anymore, then.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, it's all okay now. Let's clean everything up and head home.」

Marika
「Okay♪」
