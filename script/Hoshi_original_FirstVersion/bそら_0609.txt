Thanks to yesterday's social event (of a sort), I've managed to successfully become closer with Ousaka and Okihara-senpai.

...Or at least I'd like to think so.
But the astronomy and naturalist clubs are still deferring their statements as to whether they'll participate in the Tanabata Festival.

I resume my event committee activities today. I want to get both clubs to take another step toward participating.

％Ｂ
「So I'm thinking of going for a two-front plan.」
Marika
「Two-front...? Umm... What's that mean?」
％Ｂ
「It means that the two of us should go about persuading Ousaka and Okihara-senpai separately.」

％Ｂ
「You were getting along pretty well with Senpai yesterday, weren't you?」

Marika
「Mhm. I think I became better friends with Okihara-san than before.」

％Ｂ
「And I think I got a little closer with Ousaka too. Actually, it might not be exaggerating to say I got a lot closer.」

Marika
「Wha... R-Really!? Like how much exactly!? Are you two going to start dating or something??」

％Ｂ
「What are you talking about? Of course not. We were just acquaintances before, but now we're an upperclassman-underclassman pair who've cooked together. That's some amazing progress, right?」


Marika
「Oh, so that's what you meant...」
％Ｂ
「I had a conversation with her about something other than stars... That's huge.」
Marika
「...Is it?」
％Ｂ
「Anyway, that's why I was thinking that you should talk to Senpai, and that I should talk to Ousaka to get them both to participate in the Tanabata Festival.」


％Ｂ
「If both of us talk to them at the same time, they might feel like they're under pressure.」


％Ｂ
「I think it'd be great if we could just talk to them casually one-on-one about the camping and stuff, and just kinda get the conversation to turn toward them participating. What do you think?」


Marika
「I like it～ We don't have much time either, so I think that's a good idea～」
％Ｂ
「That's the plan, then. Let's start today.」
Marika
「Mhm, okay. Ousaka-san seems like she'd be stubborn, though. Are you going to be okay?」

％Ｂ
「I've actually come up with a bit of a strategy. I bet it'll work on Ousaka.」

all
I'm walking around school during lunch break to try to talk to Ousaka.
％Ｂ
「Where is she...?」
She wasn't in the cafeteria, and she wasn't in her classroom. I thought she might be on the roof for some reason, but she wasn't there either.

...I know it's kinda rude to think this, but I can't really imagine her doing something with someone with that personality of hers...

％Ｂ
「Hm?」
I look outside the window. I see some girls chatting happily about something as they walk back toward the building.

First-Year Girl A
「She said Aquarius has perfect luck! It's supposed to get even better by the weekend, so Friday's the perfect day for a confession!」

First-Year Girl B
「Sigh～ Libras need to be patient this week～ I just hate having to wait～」

First-Year Girl C
「Don't worry, don't worry～ It's been the worst luck possible for Aries for three weeks straight now～♪ ...Sigh～ ...Someone save me...」


％Ｂ
「...」
...Horoscopes?
Those girls came from the inner courtyard. Maybe...
％Ｂ
「There she is.」
_00cutinBS
I spot Ousaka sitting on a bench in the corner, eating yakisoba bread while reading a book.\n\r

There's no one around her.
_00cutinBS
％Ｂ
「Yo, Ousaka.」
Sora
「...」
She looks up at me from her book.
The complete lack of any greeting immediately shakes my confidence about getting closer to her yesterday.

％Ｂ
「Uhh... Can I sit next to you?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
all
I sit down next to her, and she returns her gaze to her book.
I gotta find a way to start up a conversation.
％Ｂ
「What are you eating?」
Sora
「...Yakisoba bread.」
％Ｂ
「Yakisoba bread, eh? You can get a lot of bread here, but they've still got the classics. You like yakisoba bread?」


Sora
「...Someone gave it to me.」
％Ｂ
「...So you got it from someone else, eh? I saw some girls earlier who were talking about some horoscopes. Was it from them?」

Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「...Really now...」
Sora
「...」
The conversation falls apart immediately.
That's weird...
I was able to talk to her a lot yesterday...
％Ｂ
「Uhh... So what's that book?」
Sora
「...」
I thought she ignored me for a second, but she then silently thrusts her book out toward me.

％Ｂ
「S-Sure... Thanks.」
It's a book related to stars.
And not some kinda constellation field guide for kids either. It's a pretty legitimate reference book of some kind.

％Ｂ
「...You like reading this?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
She takes a bite out of her yakisoba bread as she nods.
％Ｂ
「Enough to read it while you eat?」
Sora
「...Could eat three bowls of rice with just this.」
％Ｂ
「I have no idea what that actually means, but I can definitely tell you love stars.」

She was cutting the curry ingredients into moons and stars and everything yesterday, after all.
％Ｂ
「You love anything if it's related to stars, huh.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「All right, then I've got just the thing for someone like you.」
Sora
「...Just the thing?」
％Ｂ
「It's something amazing that's related to stars. Just a second.」

I pull out a certain something from the paper bag that I brought.
％Ｂ
「Tadaaa☆ Here's a star for you! It's some mu-"star"-d!」
Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「What do you think? It's a pretty tasty-looking "star," right?」
Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「...Uh.」
Did... Did I mess up? Did I totally screw this up?
％Ｂ
「...Uh. Just making sure you get it, but I was making a pun between the "star" in the middle of "mustard" and the stars you like...」

Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「Err, well you see... If you're wondering, it's honey mustard, so it's a bit sweet, and it's quite tasty...」

Sora
「...」
Not good. I totally screwed this up.
My plan was to get Ousaka to laugh to further break the ice...

I'm so sorry, Shinozaki.
This is Mission Failed for me...
Sora
「...」
Crap. I can't take this atmosphere anymore...
％Ｂ
「Um... I dunno what to say... I'm sor―」
Sora
「...Are you giving it to me?」
Ousaka finally responds as I'm about to apologize.
She's staring intently at the little transparent plastic container of yellow mustard.

Not just staring... She's fixated on it.
Her eyes are sparkling!
％Ｂ
「Y-Yeah... Want it now?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
I place the mustard in front of her and she immediately grabs it and pours some in her mouth.

Sora
「...Tastes like mustard.」
％Ｂ
「W-Well yeah, it's just mustard. Honey mustard, sure, but it's still gonna taste like mustard.」

Sora
「...But it's good... Mustard-good.」

She reaches for the container of mustard again.
Looks like she likes it. That's a bit of a relief.
％Ｂ
「I'll bring you some more later if you want. It's great on regular bread and sandwiches and stuff.」

Sora
「...Yakisoba bread today...」
％Ｂ
「Ri...Right... That's true...」
Sora
「...I'll have white bread tomorrow...」
She looks excited.
All right, now I've broken the ice even more with Ousaka!

...Probably.
Sora
「...Can I have some more?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, sure. You can keep eating, but you mind if we talk a bit?」

Sora
「...Mm.」
％Ｂ
「What'd you think of camping yesterday? You have fun?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「I'm glad. It's always fun to do something with lots of other people, right?」

Sora
「...*nod*...」
％Ｂ
「You think you might wanna get together with everyone and have fun like that again?」

Sora
「...Will admit.」
％Ｂ
「Then how about at the Tana―」
Sora
「...Decision deferred.」
％Ｂ
「Auh...」
She cuts me off.
But then she widens her eyes and looks at me.
Sora
「...Do I need to participate to eat the mustard?」
％Ｂ
「No, you don't. Those are two separate things. You can have as much as you want.」

Sora
「...*nod*」
Sora
「...Thanks.」
She must like the honey mustard a lot. She puts some on her yakisoba bread this time and bites into it.

Sora
「...Yakisoba and honey mustard work very well together.」
She actually looks blissful.
I'm having fun just watching her.
Sora
「...Want some?」
％Ｂ
「Uh...」
She holds out her yakisoba bread toward me. There's still about half of it left.

％Ｂ
「...You sure?」
Sora
「...Repayment for the mustard.」
That's fine and all, but this would be what people call an indirect kiss...
I guess Ousaka doesn't care about stuff like that?
％Ｂ
「...All right... I'll have some, then.」
And here I am, just a bit nervous...
Sora
「...It's good with the mustard. Would recommend.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, I'll try it.」
all
I put some of the mustard on the yakisoba bread before taking a bite.

％Ｂ
「Mgmgh...」
Sora
「...How is it?」
％Ｂ
「Oh yeah, the salty taste from the yakisoba works well with the sweet mustard.」
Sora
「...Hmhmh.」
She smiles smugly after hearing my approval.
She immediately puts some more mustard where I took a bite and takes in another mouthful.

It's clearly an indirect kiss, but Ousaka doesn't seem to mind it at all.
I wonder if she just doesn't care about things like that.\n\r
It's as if she really doesn't care about anything other than the stars...
Well, I guess it's fine if she's okay with it...
all
After school.
Natsuki
「Hey, you're going to the event committee office now, right? I'll come with.」

％Ｂ
「Sure, but... Do you not have any grad-alb committee work today?」
Natsuki
「I just feel like I'll have better photo ops with you guys. It's grad-alb committee instinct.」

Grad-alb committee instinct...
Didn't know that existed.
Natsuki
「Besides, I told you before, didn't I? The event and grad-alb committees are cut from the same cloth.」

Natsuki
「And especially since I'm involved with the astronomy and naturalist club things too. We're gonna go down with the ship together.」


％Ｂ
「...I kinda get what you're trying to say, but that's not what that means.」

Natsuki
「Really? Well, who cares about the details? Let's just go already.」

％Ｂ
「Sure, fine.」
Natsuki
「Come ooon, what are you just sitting there for? We're going.」

Rikka
「Wha... Me?」
Natsuki
「There's an event committee meeting. Get ready already.」

Rikka
「And why do I have to participate in a meeting for a committee I don't have anything to do with?」

Natsuki
「Because we all went camping and ate food from the same bowl... No, curry from the same pot. So that means you're one of us already.」


Natsuki
「You think so too, right
, Hino

?」
％Ｂ
「Huh? Oh... Uhh... Yeah, she's right.」
Rikka
「Wait, don't just decide that for yourselves. You're right that I came with you all yesterday, but that was because you all forced me to even though I already told all of you I wouldn't―」


Natsuki
「Okay okay okaaay! I get what you're trying to say. You're saying you're not good at saying no to forceful invitations, so you just want us to force you to come with this time too!」


Rikka
「N-No―」
Natsuki
「
Hino
Okay
! Grab her other arm and stand her up! Hurry up!」

％Ｂ
「Uh... S-Sure...!」
I grab Narusawa's right arm on reflex after being ordered to by Segawa.

Rikka
「W-Wait a second! What are you doing!?」
Natsuki
「We're kidnapping her! Go!」
％Ｂ
「R-Right!」
Rikka
「Y-You two are just so...!」
We're dragging Narusawa out of the classroom against her will.
...Is this really okay?
Natsuki
「We're coming in, Nirasawa!」
Shuuichi
「...I'm begging you. Couldn't you come in quietly for once?」
Rikka
「Sigh... Why am I here too...?」
％Ｂ
「Sorry, Narusawa. I kinda got swept away in the heat of the moment...」
Natsuki
「Oh? That's Misa-san. What's she doing here?」
％Ｂ
「Huh?」
all
Okihara-senpai and Shinozaki are in the committee office.
Misa
「Hello. Thank you so very much for everything yesterday.」
％Ｂ
「Senpai... Why are you here?」
Marika
「I have great news! Okihara-san's decided to participate in the Tanabata Festival!」

％Ｂ
「What!? Really!?」
all
Misa
「Yes. I learned how happy and enjoyable it is to do something with many others after I went camping with all of you yesterday.」

Misa
「And after Shinozaki-san so passionately invited me to participate yet again today, I decided to do so.」

Misa
「I may not be able to do anything particularly impressive by myself, but I feel I may be able to do at least something by drawing on the aid of all of you in the event organization committee.」


％Ｂ
「Tha...Thank you very much! We will do everything we can to support you, of course!」

Misa
「Yes. I look forward to working with you.」
Thank god.
Senpai's decided to participate in the Tanabata Festival.
I know she said we could be optimistic about her eventual decision, but to be honest, I was a little worried.

But she decided to participate because of our camping trip yesterday. I'm really glad.

all
Marika
「What do you think? I convinced Okihara-san.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. You're amazing, Shinozaki.」
Marika
「Ehehe. How'd things go for you? You said you had a strategy, but did you bring Ousaka-san... Wait, what? Why's Narusawa-san here?」


Rikka
「I'd like to know that myself...」
％Ｂ
「Uhh... My bad. I haven't convinced Ousaka yet. I talked to her a bit during lunch, but she said she was still gonna defer her decision.」

Marika
「Really～ So your strategy didn't work either? But Ousaka-san looked like she was having lots of fun yesterday too. I'm sure she'll come around.」


％Ｂ
「Y-Yeah... You're right.」
all
Natsuki
「Hey, what strategy? What'd you do to try to get Sora to wanna participate?」

％Ｂ
「That... is a trade secret.」
Natsuki
「What the heck, why can't you tell me? Jerk.」
Shuuichi
「It's 
Ryousuke 
him 
we're talking about. I bet he just tried to bait her with something.」

％Ｂ
「Gh... Th-That's... not true...?」
Damn you, Shuuichi...
How'd you know...?
Rikka
「I don't really care, but if you're going to talk about something, then could you start already?」

Natsuki
「Oh, you sure are motivated. That's the Rikka we know and love!」
Rikka
「I only said it because I'm sure you won't let me leave until you're done. I'm not motivated or anything.」

all
Shuuichi
「...Hey
, Ryousuke

. Why's Narusawa Rikka here?」
Shuuichi speaks to me in a low voice.
％Ｂ
「...Segawa dragged her into this. She said she's one of us now 'cause she came camping with us yesterday.」

Shuuichi
「I see... Sounds like something Segawa'd do. I kinda feel sorry for Narusawa.」

Rikka
「I can hear you, you know. I'll leave right away if I'm being a bother.」

Shuuichi
「Oh, no, it's fine! The event committee doesn't have enough people. And having someone as pretty as you volunteer would be great.」

Shuuichi
「Well, regardless, it's good that the naturalist club's decided to participate. Let's start discussing the Tanabata Festival, then.」


all
Broadcast Club Member
『It is almost time to leave the school. Students that have remained behind for club or committee activities, please bring your activities to a close and begin preparing to go home. To repeat―』


Shuuichi
「Hm... Time already? All right, let's wrap things up for today.」

We discussed what the naturalist club might do for the festival, but we didn't arrive at any concrete solution.

Okihara-senpai said she wanted to create a huge aquarium making use of all of the classrooms throughout the school, but that was, as expected, rejected.

Shuuichi
「Let's just say we'll continue where we left off at another time. Okihara-senpai, please let us know immediately if you have any good suggestions.」


Misa
「Sigh... I believe it would be fun... That large-scale aquarium...」
all
Marika
「I'm hungry～ Hey, want to get something to eat on the way home?」

Natsuki
「Sounds gooood. Wanna go to a family restaurant or something?」

Shuuichi
「I've got coupons for the one by the train station.」
Natsuki
「Good work, Nirasawa! Okay then, so our group's gonna be Nirasawa, Marika, Misa-san, and―」


all
Rikka
「...You're going to force me to come, aren't you?」
Natsuki
「Exactly. So that makes six people total including 

Hino
you
.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, I'm gonna pass today. I wanna stop by somewhere.」
all
Shuuichi
「What the heck, come with. I don't wanna be the only guy.」

％Ｂ
「Sorry. Next time.」
Shuuichi
「Tch. Fine, we'll go without you.」

all
Natsuki
「Yeah, let's go.」
Marika
「See you tomorrow.」
Misa
「Great work today.」
Rikka
「...Bye.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah... See you guys tomorrow.」
all
I watch everyone leave the event committee office.
％Ｂ
「All right... I'll get going too. I think I know where she is.」

I leave the committee office and head up to the roof.
％Ｂ
「Let's see... Oh, there she is.」
_00cutinBS
I spot Ousaka looking into her telescope like always on the roof.

_00cutinBS
％Ｂ
「Heeey, Ousakaaa.」
Sora
「...」
She pulls away from the telescope eyepiece, pulls her hood back, and looks at me.

％Ｂ
「Figured you'd be here right about now.」
Sora
「...What?」
％Ｂ
「Mmm... I guess I'm here for a bit of an announcement. Okihara-senpai says she's gonna participate in the Tanabata Festival. As a member of the naturalist club, of course.」


％Ｂ
「She said going camping with us yesterday made her realize that doing stuff with lots of other people was fun.」

Sora
「...I see. That's good.」
％Ｂ
「So you let me know if you start getting interested too.」
Sora
「...*nod*... Deferred.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, figured.」
I guess I can't expect her to change her mind that quickly...
％Ｂ
「We were just talking with everyone about what the naturalist club could do. Shinozaki and Segawa were there. And we forced Narusawa to come too.」


Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「Senpai said she wanted to make a large-scale aquarium using every classroom in the school. Not really possible, obviously.」

％Ｂ
「We're gonna support her as much as we can, but we can't really let the naturalist club use the entire school for itself.」

Sora
「...Every classroom as an aquarium... That sounds fun.」
％Ｂ
「You got anything you wanna try doing as the astronomy club? You don't have to worry about whether it's doable or not. Just something like, "It'd be nice if I could do something like this."」


Sora
「...I don't know.」
％Ｂ
「Okay. Well, let me know right away if you think of anything. I'll try talking to Shuuichi about making it into reality if it's something interesting.」


Sora
「...」
Ousaka looks like she's thinking about something.
％Ｂ
「Oh? You got something?」
Sora
「...*shake shake*」
Sora
「...I still don't know.」
％Ｂ
「Really...」
Sora
「...But I'll tell you if I think of something I want to do
, Ryou

.」
％Ｂ
「Sure, that's fine.」
There's no point in rushing her.
I'll just sit back and wait for Ousaka to become interested in the festival, and find something she wants to do.

％Ｂ
「Sorry for getting in the way of your stargazing.」
all
She puts her hood back on and peers back into the eyepiece.
％Ｂ
「...Hey, by the way. Why do you put your hood up when you look into the telescope?」

Sora
「...To block light from outside that could interfere with stargazing.」
％Ｂ
「Hm, I see. Same reason why you wear those polarized lenses during the day.」

Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「There's probably not much else to look at other than the moon around now at this time of year, right?」

Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「Though you might be able to see the first few stars around now during winter, since it gets dark earlier.」

Sora
「...You know a lot
, Ryou

.」
％Ｂ
「Not really, just stating the obvious... Besides, I'm pretty much a baby compared to you when it comes to knowing stuff about stars.」


Sora
「...If you're a baby, then what am I?


」
％Ｂ
「Hmm... A god? Seriously, you're pretty much above the clouds for me.」
Sora
「...Above the clouds... The stars?」
Ousaka's eyes glitter with excitement when she looks at me again.
％Ｂ
「Uh, well... It was just an analogy...」
Man. Anything's fine as long as it's related to stars, huh...
