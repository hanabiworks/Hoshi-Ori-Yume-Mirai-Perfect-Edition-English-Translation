％Ｂ & Rikka & Schiele
「Cheers!」
all
I take a draft of beer.
June.\nRikka's contest is this month.
The contest finally begins in three days, in Moscow.
First is the first qualifying round, then the second qualifying round, and then the finals.
It'll be a long battle, about a month long.
The assigned pieces start with Tchaikovsky and span a wide range from there. Performance technique and expression are going to be important of course, and so are knowledge, stamina, and willpower.
Schiele
「Gulp, gulp... Mmm～ Delicious! The first drink after a hard day of work is the best!」

Schiele
「Please, don't hesitate to eat and drink as much as you would like. Today is all my treat!」

％Ｂ
「I understand this is a sending-off party, but is it okay for her to be drinking?」
Schiele
「What do you mean?」
％Ｂ
「The concert's in three days. She'll be flying out of Japan tomorrow...」

％Ｂ
「I was just thinking she might want to practice more, go to the venue a few days in advance, and get her health and condition stabilized.」

Schiele
「Doing unnecessary work at this stage would only worsen her performance, and Rikka-san isn't so weak she would need to warm up at the venue.」


Schiele
「A certain level of nervousness can in fact further enhance your playing, and you cannot be a pianist if you find yourself overcome by pressure with each and every contest.」


％Ｂ
「That seems very harsh...」
Schiele
「Then are you expecting Rikka-san to be crushed in the contest?」

％Ｂ
「No.」
Schiele
「Are you expecting she will place anywhere other than first among pianists?」
％Ｂ
「I am not.」
Schiele
「Same for me. I believe Rikka-san will win first place, and I have nurtured her for the last four years so she will.」

Rikka
「Schiele-sensei's acted as a judge for this contest in the past.」

％Ｂ
「Huh... So that means he knows the contest well, then.」
Schiele
「The contest is nothing more than a checkpoint. Getting first place won't be the end, will it?」

Schiele
「This is a place for the entire world to see Rikka-san's ability, and make her name known. We may as well aim for the grand prize, and not simply first place in the piano section.」
％Ｂ
「Grand prize?」
Rikka
「It's the award given to the most impressive performer out of all of the groups.」

％Ｂ
「So they'd be the overall champion of the entire contest.」
％Ｂ
「That's amazing! You'd be way more of a talking point if you win that! Wouldn't that make you a famous pianist right away!?」

Rikka
「If I get it, yes. It won't be that easy. Hehe, but you'll be cheering me on. I'll try for it with the best performance I can manage.」
Schiele
「Rikka-san, you really do shine best when you're with him.」
Rikka
「Wha?」
Schiele
「You came to meet me alongside Sayaka in the past, didn't you?」

Rikka
「Yes. I remember meeting you several times when I was young.」
Schiele
「To tell you the truth, I believed you would abandon the piano. Even if you did not, that you would not last for even a few years after that...」

Rikka
「...」
Schiele
「Back then, you were only playing the piano.」
％Ｂ
「...」
Only playing the piano...
Rikka
「Playing piano is a dialogue between you and the audience... I was too worried about myself to see any further.」

Schiele
「But, when I heard your sound again many years after, it was completely different. It shone. I could hardly believe that you were truly the same person.」

Schiele
「Your setback must have been a necessary thing. To allow you to meet him and the others who have supported your sound.」

Rikka
「I also think so. My current sound is not just mine. It's the sound of happiness, filled with my feelings for everyone.」


This is pretty nice.
I wonder if I'll be able to talk like this with Mr. Azuma someday.
all
Schiele
「Hey miss! I'd like some cold sake and a plate of skewered squid as juicy as your hips, pleeease!」
Bar Employee
「Hieh!?」
％Ｂ
「...」
...I bet he'd be a much more impressive teacher if he didn't have this weird sexual predator vibe to him.

Rikka
「Oh, the cabaret club. Is it true that you've asked him to come to a cabaret club with you?」

％Ｂ
「Ack...」
I can't believe she'd remember that at a time like this.
Schiele
「He's just sooo cold. I've asked him to go many times, but he never comes. A cabaret club isn't a dirty place. It's a place to enjoy yourself while talking with pretty ladies.」
％Ｂ
「My answer is still no. I don't want to worry Rikka or give her any reason to have to be suspicious.」
Schiele
「Your manhood will go to waste if you're too afraid of your wife to have fun with the ladies. Rikka-san will not be here, so would you like to go next weekend? It'll change your life!」
Rikka
「Sensei!!」
％Ｂ
「...I'm not gonna go, don't worry.」
all
We leave the bar and part ways with Schiele-sensei.
The two of us walk along the seashore path, cooling off our alcohol-flushed bodies.

Rikka
「...You really won't go to the cabaret club?」
％Ｂ
「You're still going on about this?」
Rikka
「I can't help it... I'm going to be making you wait for a whole month... Don't you think you're going to be... frustrated?」

％Ｂ
「I might be, yeah.」
Rikka
「Uuuh... Maybe we should do it a little bit after all? Like with my mouth, or just the tip...」

％Ｂ
「I'd rather not do it at all than do it with just the tip... We decided not to have sex until you get back, right?」

Rikka's going to take a ten-hour flight to Moscow tomorrow at noon.

Shionagi Airport doesn't have any international flights, so she needs to go to Tokyo, which means she has to leave the house in the morning.

If she ended up somehow becoming unwell or hurt in some way from us having sex, it'd have serious repercussions.

Which is why the two of us had decided to not do anything today.
％Ｂ
「Don't underestimate me. I can hold off for a month easily if it's for you.」

Rikka
「Hehe... I don't know how to respond to you bragging about something like that.」
Rikka
「...But thank you.」
Her light, soft weight bumps into me.
I firmly take her into my arms.
Rikka
「Wait for me. I'll... do my best. And then I'm going to have you congratulate me.」
％Ｂ
「I'll be waiting with the celebration stuff ready.」
Rikka
「I've made food that'll last and put it in the fridge, but you'll have to make anything more yourself. Make sure you iron your shirts after washing them. Plastics that don't have the plastics mark are flammable trash.」

％Ｂ
「I know. I know I still mess up the plastics sometimes, but I'll be careful.」
Rikka
「Let's go on lots and lots of fun dates once I'm back. And let's have lots and lots of intense sex too.」
％Ｂ
「Lots of intense sex...」
Rikka
「Auh... Geez. You always only ever think about the dirty stuff...」
％Ｂ
「I believe that may be inevitable for a man.」
Rikka
「Mhm... We'll have crazy sex to make up for a month of not having any. Ehehe... Mm, chu.」
She raises her heels and kisses me.
Our heights are about ten centimeters apart.
It's a difference that makes it easy for us to kiss.
Her soft, smiling eyes are right there before me.
％Ｂ
「Take care.」
Rikka
「I will. I'll deliver my precious sound to the world.」
It's been a while since Rikka left Japan.
She's still in Moscow.
She blew through the first qualifying round, and is currently steadily advancing through the second.
I'm gonna hurry up and get Mr. Azuma to approve of me too!
I'm gonna do the work that I've been assigned, and be assertive about helping out too.
Azuma
「Hm... Hino.」
Azuma
「Hm...」
I turn around to see Mr. Azuma looking thoughtful, with a hand to his chin.
Azuma
「You've been working here pretty much every day lately.」
％Ｂ
「I guess I have. I'm mostly finished with all of my credits for university.」
Azuma
「You're a senior, right? You sure you shouldn't be job hunting?」
％Ｂ
「I have no intention of working anywhere other than here.」
Azuma
「Limiting your options is the same as limiting your career. What are you gonna do if I tell you I won't hire you?」
％Ｂ
「I'll just have to do the best I can to get you to want to hire me.」
Azuma
「Phew... You're real stubborn for how flexible a thinker you are.」
％Ｂ
「I'm very sorry...」
Azuma
「I never said it was a bad thing. That's just who you are. It's up to you whether or not you use that to its fullest potential, in a positive way.」

Azuma
「...All right. Wanna try the promotion test?」
％Ｂ
「Oh...! Yes! I would love to!」
Azuma
「But it wouldn't be fun to have you take the test normally. How about I give you a special test?」

％Ｂ
「So you're changing the contents based on whether you think it's interesting or not... Well, I guess I should've seen that coming.」

Azuma
「It's who I am.」
all
％Ｂ
「Sluuuurp～」
I slurp down my ramen.
I made it with uncooked noodles, bean sprouts, fish cakes, and egg, so it's got lots of nutrition.
％Ｂ
「Crunch crunch crunch...」
I eat the pickled daikon Rikka made.
It's got good texture and flavor.
Rikka likes doing traditional everyday household stuff like making this too.
I've already eaten everything she made for me, so I only have this and pickled plums left.

％Ｂ
「I wanna eat Rikka's cooking...」
I'm caught between a rock and a hard place. I want her to do her best over there, but I want her to hurry up and come home too.

％Ｂ
「...Still, a draft... Hm.」
Mr. Azuma gave me a drafting test.
I shouldn't have any problems with technique, since I've been studying for the architect exam... Or at least, I think I shouldn't.

The issue is what I'm supposed to draft.
"Draft a blueprint of the house that you think you'll be living in ten years from now."
％Ｂ
「Ten years from now... Ten years... I wonder what'll have happened by then.」
I can imagine ideal futures for myself.
But I can't help but wonder.
Which of those is really the best?
％Ｂ
「Hm?」
I grab my phone and tap the screen.

％Ｂ
「Hello?」
Rikka
『I'm through the second qualifying round! I'm going to be in the finals!』
Her voice sounds bright and cheery over the line.
％Ｂ
「Really!? That's great!」
Rikka
『Hehe, thank you! So that means I'm going to be over here for longer...』

％Ｂ
「Don't worry about it. It's great you've made it this far.」
％Ｂ
「I've been making food for myself, ironing my shirts, and sorting the plastics properly too.」

Rikka
『Hehe... Say... Are you lonely?』
％Ｂ
「I am.」
Rikka
『Me too... I'm lonely too. I want to see you soon, Ryousuke... I want to hear your voice directly... I want to have you squeeze me... I want to have you kiss me too...』
Rikka
『Me too... I'm lonely too. I want to see you soon... I want to hear your voice directly... I want to have you squeeze me... I want to have you kiss me too...』
％Ｂ
「It's only for a little longer. I'm doing my best over here, too. I was actually just given the chance to take the test for being promoted to a full-time employee today.」
Rikka
『What? Really!? Congratulations! You've been working so hard for this.』

％Ｂ
「Well, I dunno how it's gonna turn out, since I haven't passed yet. I'll go for it with everything I've got now. So you do your best so you don't have any regrets either, Rikka.」


Rikka
『Mhm. I'll give my best performance until the very end. Okay, I'll call you again. Oh, it's nighttime over there, right? Rest up. Good night.』


％Ｂ
「You too. Night.」
_smh_st_04
I resume eating my ramen after the call.
％Ｂ
「Sluuurpp～ ...My house ten years from now... Hm. Hmmh...」
