We all gather in the old school building Monday after school.
Marika
「Filters?」

Misa
「Yes. They circulate the water in the tank, filter it, and clean it.」

Touko
「And we can make those ourselves?」
％Ｂ
「They're surprisingly simple. I think even amateurs like us could make them. So let's make them together today.」


all
I picked up the materials yesterday with Okihara-senpai.
PVC pipes, filters, a motor, a plastic box to house the filter and motor... and that's it.

The motor pulls water from the tank and moves it through the PVC pipes toward the filter box.
The filter inside cleans the water, and returns it back into the tank.

It requires a bit of construction, but it seems simple enough.

Marika
「I think building it sounds fun～ Let's try it!」


Touko
「Well, if it's boring, then I guess I can just quit halfway through.」
％Ｂ
「...Please do it until the end.」
all
We all start working.
I walk around to see how everyone's doing. It looks a little dangerous, since they're not used to the tools.

Sora
「Can I cut this into a star?」
％Ｂ
「That'd make it leak water, you know...」
Sora
「...But I think it'd be pretty.」
％Ｂ
「Let's take function over form.」
all
Touko
「This isn't really fitting, you know.」
She's pushing a PVC pipe against a motor.
Looks like the pieces aren't connecting properly.
％Ｂ
「Is it that tough? That's weird. Let me try.」

Touko
「Are you sure the sizes match?」
％Ｂ
「It is a bit of a tight fit, but I'm pretty sure this should still...」
I focus on my fingertips and carefully line up the two components.
％Ｂ
「...There. They're connected.」
Touko
「Whaaat? How?」
Marika
「You're just so good with your hands.」
％Ｂ
「I just like working on these smaller details.」
Marika
「I think it's amazing...」
Touko
「I guess you really wouldn't guess it from that face of yours.」
％Ｂ
「My face has nothing to do with this!」
Marika
「...Hehe.」
all
Marika
「Huh?」
Segawa's got her camera pointed toward Shinozaki.

％Ｂ
「What's that for?」
Natsuki
「Huh? Oh, well, you were making a really good expression just now.」


Marika
「A good expression? Me?」
Natsuki
「It was just this indescribably cute expression～ I thought it was a good photo-op, and my body moved on its own. I must've been born to be a photographer.」


％Ｂ
「Hmm. But did something happen just now?」
Marika
「D-Don't ask me... I don't know myself～」

all
Touko
「...Oh, I know.」
％Ｂ
「Hm? What?」
Touko
「Nooothing.」
Marika
「Come on, let's get back to work!」
all
％Ｂ
「Well, I'm glad you got a good photo. Use it for the graduation album.」

Marika
「What? N-No! I'd like it if you definitely didn't use it～」

％Ｂ
「It's proof of the golden years of our youth, isn't it?」
Marika
「It-It is, but... I mean～～～～」
Misa
「Oh, Marika-san, your hands!」
Marika
「Huh? Oh...」
...But it's already too late.
Water sprayed out from the piping that Shinozaki had attached to the tank that she had been working on.

all
Marika
「Kyah!?」
The water hits her directly.
％Ｂ
「Y-You okay?」
I remove the PVC piping to stop the flow.
Marika
「Aww, I'm soaked...」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, you got pretty wet...」
There's water dripping from her hair.
Marika
「Oh, but it's mostly just my hair. There's only a little bit on my uniform, so I think it'll dry in no time.」

％Ｂ
「No, what if you get the chills?」
％Ｂ
「I'm gonna go grab a towel.」
all
Misa
「Perhaps you would like to also go out into the sun, Marika-san? It's very nice weather today.」



Sora
「You'll dry quick in the sun.」
all
Marika
「Okay... I'm sorry. Excuse me then, I'm going to go dry myself out～」

％Ｂ
「How do you feel? You okay?」
Marika
「Yeah, I'm fine. Thanks for the towel.」

It looks like it really was mostly her hair. She looks fine after wiping her wet hair.

Marika
「I'm fine now. Let's go back.」
％Ｂ
「No, not yet. Your hair's still wet, right? We can go back once your hair's dry.」

Marika
「I'm okay though～」
％Ｂ
「No, no. I can't let you catch a cold.」
Marika
「I'm not a kid, I'm fine～」
％Ｂ
「You can't let your guard down like that.」
Marika
「Uuuuh... You're really overprotective of me
, Hino-kun

.」
Overprotective...
Now that she mentions it...
％Ｂ
「Am I a bother?」
Marika
「Oh, no, you're not! I'm really happy that you're worried about me. I'm happy, but...」


％Ｂ
「What? Just say it.」
Marika
「...No, it's nothing. But I'm really fine, okay?」

％Ｂ
「I... know that.」
Marika
「Yeah... Okay then. Thanks. For the towel, too.」

％Ｂ
「No, it's nothing...」
Overprotective.
I... really must be too worried.
But I just can't help but remember how she was back when we were kids.
Shinozaki couldn't participate in Tanabata, camping, or anything back then.
That's why I want to make sure things go well for the Tanabata Festival this year.
So we need to be careful...
Marika
「I'll stay here until my hair's dry, so you can go back.」

％Ｂ
「You gonna be fine alone?」
Marika
「Ahaha, of course I'll be fine. I'm just going to be sitting in the sun.」

％Ｂ
「Right, that's true. Then make sure you dry up completely, all right?」

Marika
「Yeah... I'm sorry.」
％Ｂ
「Hm? About what?」
Marika
「For getting in the way of the work.」
％Ｂ
「But you're not getting in the way.」
Marika
「But I can't help at all... I'm finally able to do stuff to prepare for the Tanabata Festival with you, but I'm not very useful, am I?」


％Ｂ
「That's not true. You worry too much.」
Marika
「But...」
She looks down.
She must be seriously bothered by this.
Even though I've never even once thought anything like that.
％Ｂ
「You're always doing great, Shinozaki. I'm really grateful for you.」

Marika
「You... think so?」
％Ｂ
「Of course. You worry too much. In fact, you need to make sure you don't overexert yourself. You don't have a strong body.」


Everything will have been for nothing if she overexerts herself and goes down before the festival.
We need to make sure that doesn't happen.
Marika
「Y-Yeah... But, um... I'm～」
Natsuki
「Oh, heeey
, Hino

! Misa-san's calling for you!」
Marika
「Oh...」
Shinozaki's interrupted by Segawa's appearance.
％Ｂ
「All right, I'll be right there. Shinozaki, uh...」

Marika
「No, it's okay. You can go. It's not that important.」

％Ｂ
「You sure? Then make sure you get completely dry, okay?」
Marika
「Okay.」
all
Things have kinda gotten awkward.
But I want to see this plan through properly, together with Shinozaki.
So we need to be careful...
