The next day.
Natsuki
『Ngaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh!』
$$smh_OpenCHK
Sora
「...Hm...?」
Touko
「Huh?」
Marika
「Fueh?」
Misa
「Oh my...」
Rikka
「What... was that scream just now...?」
％Ｂ
「Hmm...」
The photos came out badly again.
Some of them have stars with trails, and some of them are completely black.
Some of the really bad ones are blurry, which means the stars weren't even in focus...

％Ｂ
「These... are pretty bad.」
Natsuki
「Hauauaahh... I wanna die...」
Natsuki collapses soullessly onto her desk.

all
％Ｂ
「But they're not all shaky like the ones last time, so it's still a step forward, don't you think?」

Natsuki
「Yeah, but they're out of focus instead now... That's not one step forward, it's more like three steps forward, two steps back...」

％Ｂ
「That's still a step forward, though...」
Natsuki
「Either way though, the exposure time's still the main issue...」
Natsuki
「The longest we went for this time was a minute. One minute, and we still see trails on the stars... but if we keep the shutter open for less than a minute, we won't get enough light...」


％Ｂ
「What about going back to the digital camera? You'll be able to check how they came out right away that way, so we won't use up as much time.」


％Ｂ
「And I think it'd stop making you wanna die every time we get the photos developed...」

Natsuki
「I already told you, I can't get good photos of the night sky with the one I have... I don't think there's any point then. Right?」

Natsuki
「There are digital cameras that can take photos of stars, obviously. But those are easily worth more than 100,000 yen... and then a lens on top of that, so it's way out of my reach...」


％Ｂ
「Isn't that film camera you're using right now pretty expensive?」
Natsuki
「Oh, this... It's my dad's. He apparently took out a loan to buy it back in the day during a big camera fad. Things really last a long time when they're well made...」


％Ｂ
「Oh, you're right about that. It's the same for architecture. People say a building can last for a hundred or even two hundred years if you spend your money on good, sturdy materials.」


Natsuki
「Yeah... So that means people without money should just give up on taking good photos... Fufu, how hilarious. Money's all that matters in the world... Laugh at me now. Just call me an out-of-focus little dummy...」


％Ｂ
「Uh... Seriously, why do you get so self-deprecating when you're down?」

Natsuki
「I can't help iiit... What do I even have left if you take my camera away from me...?」
％Ｂ
「You're my girlfriend.」
Natsuki
「Other than that.」
％Ｂ
「No, not other than that! You're gonna get me depressed now!」
Natsuki
「It's because what you said was so obvious. I'd go into cardiac arrest if you took the fact that I'm your girlfriend away from me.」


％Ｂ
「Oh, okay. Hearing you go that far with it's kinda exciting, actually.」
％Ｂ
「Anyway, let's go take photos again tonight. I'll come with you. And tomorrow night and the night after too, whenever.」

Natsuki
「...Mhm. But isn't it annoying for you?」
％Ｂ
「'Course not. It's fun just being with you. Oh, I know. How about a reward once you get good photos?」

Natsuki
「So you're saying I'll never get a reward again if I don't get them...」
％Ｂ
「What, you can't?」
Natsuki
「I...I'll do it! I can take them! Mhm, yeah... I'll get good photos... So I want my reward in advance!」

％Ｂ
「Fine by me.」
We smile at each other.
I place my hand against the small of her back, Natsuki wraps her arms around my neck, and we─

Shuuichi
「Oh, what? I didn't know you guys were at school.」
Ryousuke・Natsuki
％Ｂ
「Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh!」
Natsuki
「Hyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!」
％Ｂ・Natsuki
％Ｂ
「Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh!」
Natsuki
「Hyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!」
all
％Ｂ
「Yo...You! You! You gotta knock when you're coming in! That's common sense!」

Natsuki
「What the heck are you even thinking!? How do you have so little common sense!?」
Shuuichi
「Oh, come on... You guys never knock when you come in...」
％Ｂ
「You did it to us 'cause we did it to you... Come on, man. Let's end this cycle of hatred.」
Shuuichi
「I'm in full agreement. That's why you two better start knocking from now on too. Anyway, how are the photos for the astronomy club going?」

％Ｂ
「We're working on it.」
Shuuichi
「I see. That's good to hear. Still, I'm jealous of you two. I know you're busy with work, but you still get to be together every day.」


Shuuichi
「Meanwhile, I don't get to see Kaori-san... Wait, what's up with these? Ugh, these are some awful photos. What amateur took these? They're not even in focus.」


Natsuki
「Hauauahhh... I wanna die...」
％Ｂ
「Aaahhhh! Dammit, I just got her back on her feet! Learn to read the mood, Shuuichi!」

Shuuichi
「Huh? Wait, you took these, Segawa? You sure you're going to be okay for the astronomy club's request?」

％Ｂ
「We'll be fine. We're gonna go take photos again tonight.」
Shuuichi
「No, that's probably not a good idea.」
％Ｂ
「Huh? Why?」
Shuuichi
「You don't know? There's apparently a hurricane heading this way.」

Natsuki
「Wha... A hurricane?」
Shuuichi
「It's apparently going to pass through just tonight though, since it's a pretty fast one. The other clubs were told to wrap things up early today too.」


％Ｂ
「A hurricane... Yeah, no photography tonight, then...」
Shuuichi
「Sorry about this, but you guys need to leave too. School's closed for the day now.」
Shuuichi
「I'm going to go return the key to the faculty office, so you can leave without me. Take care on the way home.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, you too. Later.」
all
Natsuki
「Sigh...」
％Ｂ
「Cheer up. He said the hurricane would be gone by tomorrow, and the weather'll get better all at once after that, right? Let's go again tomorrow night.」


％Ｂ
「I know... You wanna come over right now? We can brainstorm a plan.」
Natsuki
「Brainstorm a plan...?」
％Ｂ
「I'll do research and stuff too. Let's put together a strategy for tomorrow night.」

Natsuki
「...Sure.」
％Ｂ
「All right! Let's get going!」
all
％Ｂ
「The wind's getting pretty strong...」
I can see the trees swaying pretty hard outside through the window.
Yeah, there's definitely a hurricane coming.
％Ｂ
「You probably shouldn't stay too late at this rate. Sorry for saying this after I invited you over and stuff, but I think you should go home without eating dinner here or anything.」


％Ｂ
「Though... I guess staying the night's an option too...」

...No response from Natsuki.
She's sprawled out on the couch.
She's staring up at the ceiling, muttering to herself about something.
Natsuki
「Maybe I have to rethink the aperture size... No, it might be an issue with the lens... The exposure time's the main thing... High-sensitivity film might work...」


Guess she didn't hear me.
％Ｂ
「Honestly...」
She's completely focused on photography right now.
Let's just focus on figuring out a way to take pictures of stars, without doing anything unnecessary.

I turn back toward the laptop I brought down from my room.
I've been looking up ways of getting good photos of stars on the internet.
％Ｂ
「I've found some websites... but they're all digital camera methods...」
There aren't many sites with information on how to get photos of stars using a film camera.
The few I've found are all on how to get them to leave trails.
％Ｂ
「Hmmh... Modern-day issues, huh...」
I've started to get an understanding of this stuff through my research too.\n \n\r
If you want to take clear photos of the stars with a film camera, you definitely need at least a minute of exposure time.

But as long as Earth turns on its axis, the stars will move across the sky.
Which makes it impossible to take photos of the stars as points of light.
％Ｂ
「And they even say old photos of stars pretty much always had them with trails...」

But there were definitely photos of constellations back in the days before digital cameras were a thing.
There has to be a way.
％Ｂ
「It says you could also try using special high-sensitivity film, but that's a bit too niche... I dunno if we'll be able to get film like that anywhere here...」


％Ｂ
「If only Earth didn't rotate. Then the stars wouldn't move. Or maybe we could move the camera in time with the movement of the stars...」


But that's impossible...
The whole point of using the remote shutter release in the first place is to lower camera shake.
％Ｂ
「I guess using a digital camera's the easiest option after all...」
％Ｂ
「Hm... Wait a second... What's this?」
％Ｂ
「An... equatorial mount?」
"If one wishes to take photos of celestial bodies as points of light, then an 'equatorial mount,' which moves automatically with the stars, is necessary. It is a familiar piece of equipment to those who stargaze."
％Ｂ
「Hey... Natsuki... Natsuki!」
Natsuki
「...What?」
％Ｂ
「You know what an equatorial mount is?」
Natsuki
「...The heck's that? Is that a kind of horse or something?」
％Ｂ
「Come here! Just come here for a second!」
all
Natsuki gets up from the couch and walks over.
％Ｂ
「Here, this.」
Natsuki
「...An equatorial mount is a special frame... which moves automatically along with celestial bodies...」

％Ｂ
「I think there won't be any issues with the exposure time if we use one of these. It moves with the stars while the camera's taking in light, which means we'll be able to get photos of the stars without any trails!」


Natsuki
「What the heck... Does something that convenient even exist!?」
％Ｂ
「It totally does! Just look, it's written right here!」
Natsuki
「Oh, but... it also says... "They are relatively expensive, often at least 10,000 yen, and so those who are not serious about stargazing may find one difficult to purchase"... I can't use one, then...」


％Ｂ
「What are you talking about? We know someone who's serious about stargazing!」

Natsuki
「...Sora!?」
％Ｂ
「I-I'm gonna ask her real quick!」
all
I pull out my phone and start up LIME.
【％Ｂ】「You know what an #Nequatorial mount is?」
％Ｂ
「Hope she responds soon...」
【Sora】「I do」
That was fast! She's responded already!
【％Ｂ】「You don't happen to #Nhave one, do you?」
【Sora】「I do」
％Ｂ
「She says she's got one!」
Natsuki
「B-But... it's expensive, so I don't know if she'd wanna lend it to others...」

％Ｂ
「Maybe? But it's Ousaka, so...」
all
【％Ｂ】「Could we borrow it? #NWe need it for taking #Nphotos of the #Nconstellations!」
％Ｂ
「Come on...!」
【Sora】「Tomorrow at noon #NRooftop」
％Ｂ
「That means... She wants us to come to the roof at noon so she can lend it to us, right...?」

Natsuki
「Maybe... I hope so...」
％Ｂ
「I-I guess we'll just have to go there and see...」
all
【％Ｂ】「We'll be there!」
