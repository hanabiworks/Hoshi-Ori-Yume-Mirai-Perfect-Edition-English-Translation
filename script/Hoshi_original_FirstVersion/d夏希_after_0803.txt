「Hm...?」
Well that's interesting. It's a LIME message.
Natsuki and I use LIME to communicate, but I almost never get any messages while I'm at work.

％Ｂ
「Who's it from...?」
【Shuuishi】「It's been a while! #NHow's it going?」
％Ｂ
「Oh... It's Shuuichi!」
I say it out loud without thinking, and then frantically look around.\n \n\r
Thankfully, Azuma-san's currently out, and my senior coworkers are busy with some guests, so they haven't noticed.

...Just a bit's fine, right?
【％Ｂ】「Yeah, seriously. I'm #Ndoing great. What's up?」
【Shuuishi】「You've heard about the #Nclass reunion, right?」
【％Ｂ】「Yeah. Heard you guys #Nwere talking to Natsuki #Nabout it without me #Neven knowing.」
【Shuuishi】「Now don't get jealous. #NI was real surprised #Nwhen Segawa suddenly #Nasked me to help.」
【％Ｂ】「I'm not freakin jealous!」
【Shuuishi】「Enough of that. Wanna #Ngo out for drinks #Ntonight? There's the #Nclass reunion to talk #Nabout, but I also just #Nwanna talk with you for #Nthe first time in a #Nwhile.」
【％Ｂ】「I've got time. I can be #Nout of work by 7. That #Nfine?」
【Shuuishi】「Works for me. Let me #Nknow once you're done #Nwith work. You can #Ncall, I don't care.」
【％Ｂ】「Got it. Talk to you #Nlater, then.」
％Ｂ
「I haven't seen Shuuichi since university...」
We went to different schools, but we hung out a few times every year back then.
We haven't seen each other since we both got busy with work.
I wonder how things are going with him?
％Ｂ
「I'm kinda excited now.」
％Ｂ
「Shuuichi!」
Shuuichi
「Hey
, Hino

! Long time no see!」
％Ｂ
「What the heck, man, you haven't changed a bit!」
Shuuichi
「Same for you. I thought you'd be all fat and bubbly from happiness now that you're married.」


％Ｂ
「You dumbass. My everyday life's so fun, I don't even have the time to get fat.」
Shuuichi
「Bragging about your newlywed life already, eh? Well, I'm just glad you're doing well.」
％Ｂ
「Let's head inside.」
％Ｂ
「Cheers!」
Shuuichi
「Cheers!」
all
％Ｂ
「Ngh, ngh, ngh... Pfaaahh! Ahh... Beer always hits the spot.」

Shuuichi
「...Pfahh! Excuse me, another beer!」
％Ｂ
「Wow, you're fast...」
Shuuichi
「Sure am. They make me drink every day at work. Beer's pretty much the same as water to me at this point.」

％Ｂ
「Don't ruin yourself, man.」
I heard that Shuuichi started working at Shionagi City Hall after graduating.
He's apparently found stable employment in a role involving invigorating local culture.

He apparently manages various events put on by the city.
I guess he wasn't chair of the event committee back then for nothing.
Shuuichi
「How's work going for you?」
％Ｂ
「Uh... Well, not bad, I guess.」
Shuuichi
「What's that supposed to mean? Aren't you giving it everything you've got for Segawa's sake?」


％Ｂ
「I'm nowhere near good enough yet. I got to participate in a firm competition recently, and I got nowhere.」

Shuuichi
「Is Azuma-san strict?」
％Ｂ
「It's more like he makes no compromises when it comes to work. He might seem kinda messy, but he's completely different when he's working. Though that's a given.」


％Ｂ
「He always immediately tells me when I mess up. Though I'm definitely learning a lot.」

Shuuichi
「Yeah, working at Azuma-san's firm was your dream, right? Oh, excuse me, another one!」

％Ｂ
「How'd you drink that so fast...?」
Shuuichi
「Anyway, you've got your wife to think about. You can't get down over the little stuff.」

％Ｂ
「I never said I was down about it. And why are you acting so superior?」

He seriously hasn't changed at all...
％Ｂ
「Speaking of, how are things going with Kaori-san?」
Shuuichi
「Hm? We're still together, of course.」
％Ｂ
「You two aren't gonna get married?」
Shuuichi
「...Actually, I wanted to ask you about that.」
％Ｂ
「About what?」
Shuuichi
「...Be honest. What's it like being married!?」
％Ｂ
「Why are you asking...? Oh, wait a second, is this the real reason why you wanted to get drinks today?」

Shuuichi
「Hm... W-Well... That's one reason... Maybe.」
Class reunion, my ass...
Shuuichi
「To be honest, I've been thinking about it lately. Though there's also the fact that Kaori-san's older than me, and I don't want to make her wait too long.」

Shuuichi
「But you know what people say, right? About how you notice some flaws in the other person only once you start living together, and then you start hating it!」


％Ｂ
「Oh... Yeah, I've heard about stuff like that.」
Shuuichi
「Right? Right? And so I would love it if you would discuss such matters with me, 
Hino-san
my dear friend
, as you are the senior when it comes to marriage!」

％Ｂ
「Why are you acting so formal? ...Anyway, uhh... I guess there are things that you only start seeing once you're married, yeah.」

Shuuichi
「Like!?」
％Ｂ
「Like... I always thought she was a bread person, but she's actually more about rice, or like how she actually kinda believes the fortune-telling they do on TV every morning, or like how she likes her baths hot.」


Shuuichi
「I don't wanna hear you gush about her! Isn't there anything you don't like!?」

％Ｂ
「Anything I don't like...? Hmm... Not really, I guess.」
Shuuichi
「Kh... You lovey-dovey bastard. This is exactly why you end up on TV during your beach dates!」


％Ｂ
「Wha... Y-You saw that!?」
Shuuichi
「I did. You were a picture-perfect idiot couple.」
％Ｂ
「Uuughh... Mind your own business.」
After they've finally stopped teasing me about it at work, too...
Shuuichi
「Sigh... But serious talk, I was jealous. Made me realize you two were still in love enough that you'd still go on beach dates even after you got married.」


％Ｂ
「I-I guess, yeah... Actually, you've been dating Kaori-san for a long time now, right? So then it's not like it'd matter to you at this point if you got married and found something you didn't like, right?」


Shuuichi
「Right! Small stuff like that won't do anything to my love for Kaori-san! But I don't know if she feels the same way...」


％Ｂ
「Don't worry. I bet she's the same way. She won't mind some little stuff.」

％Ｂ
「Actually, I'm pretty sure she's already known about the annoying parts of you for a long time now, since you've been dating for so long.」

％Ｂ
「She's still dating you in spite of that, so you don't need to worry.」

Shuuichi
「Y-You think so? Maybe... I hope so.」
％Ｂ
「What are you acting all scared for? That's not like you at all. You sure working full time hasn't gotten you too comfortable? Have you even told Kaori-san that you wanna marry her?」


Shuuichi
「No... I haven't told her yet.」
％Ｂ
「That's pathetic, man. Hurry up and propose to her already. Marriage is all about timing and the heat of the moment.」

Shuuichi
「Timing and the heat of the moment... Gotta say, guys who get married just 'cause they "might" have made a baby sure have a different way of thinking.」


％Ｂ
「Hgh... You... Why would you say that...」
Shuuichi
「I want to get married after thinking properly through my future. I'm going to propose to Kaori-san once I'm making good money, and I'm able to provide for her.」


％Ｂ
「Hmph... If she's willing to wait that long, that is. It's fine to be careful and all, but don't blame me if Kaori-san starts thinking you're wishy-washy 'cause of that.」


Shuuichi
「Oh, come on... That's completely different from what you were saying earlier!」
％Ｂ
「I dunno. Not like I'm Kaori-san.」
Shuuichi
「You irresponsible asshole! I never should've asked you for advice!」

％Ｂ
「Whoops, sorry my advice isn't useful for losers.」
Shuuichi
「The hell did you just say?」
％Ｂ
「You wanna go?」
We glare at each other, fists clenched on our beer steins.
Shuuichi
「...Man, we seriously haven't changed, have we?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah... That was pretty nostalgic just now.」
We clink our steins together again.
Shuuichi
「I'm gonna mess with you like crazy at the reunion. Hope you're ready.」
％Ｂ
「It won't do anything to me. Don't underestimate a married man.」

all
We laugh and drain our beers.
It's a good night.
