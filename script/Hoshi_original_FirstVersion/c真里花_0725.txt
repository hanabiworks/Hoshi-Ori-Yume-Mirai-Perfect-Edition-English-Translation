「What do you think about this level of brightness?」
I'm showing everyone the light source we worked on at home.
Sora
「...*nod* I think we can do up to magnitude 6 with this.」

％Ｂ
「Really? That's great.」
Marika
「How many stars will we have if we include up to magnitude 6?」
Sora
「...About six thousand.」

Touko
「Six thousand? ...Are we going to have to make all those holes...?」
Sora
「...Up to magnitude 6 would be best for impact. It's about as much as you can see out in the mountains.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, we'd definitely wanna do at least that much. Okay, let's all work hard!」

all
Marika
「Let's do it!」
Marika and I pump our fists.
Rikka
「...」
all
％Ｂ
「H-Huh?」
Natsuki
「You know, haven't you two been even more in sync today?」
％Ｂ
「What? Well yeah, we're childhood friends... and there's also the fact that we're dating...」
all
Marika
「...Right?」

Touko
「Mmm... But I feel like something's a bit different from last week.」

％Ｂ
「From last week? ...Why?」
Touko
「I dunno? Maybe something happened?」
％Ｂ
「No...! N-Nothing really...」
all
Natsuki
「That face was pretty suspicious just now～」
％Ｂ
「D-Don't take photos! I'm serious, nothing happened!」
Though something did happen.
I took a step forward with my relationship with Marika...
Natsuki
「You grinned just now!」
％Ｂ
「No I didn't!!」
all
all
Marika
「...」
％Ｂ
「Ughh, I'm tired. I freaked out when they said we were acting differently from last week.」

Marika
「R-Right～ I wonder what was different about us?」
％Ｂ
「Hmm, maybe... we were closer or something?」
Marika
「D-Did we really get that close to each other?」
％Ｂ
「Well, maybe we didn't realize... you know? Like, both body and soul...」

Marika
「Yeah, we went all bump-bump...」
％Ｂ
「Bump-bump...」
It's a cute way of putting it, but still somehow graphic...
Marika
「A-Ahahahaha... It-It's a nickname... Just a nickname...」
％Ｂ
「R-Right... Still, they're all real sharp. But it's not like we're gonna be honest with them about something like this.」

Marika
「Y-Yeah, that's true...」
％Ｂ
「Well, that aside...」
There are still people who we need to tell about the fact that we're dating.

％Ｂ
「So, uh... Do your mom... and dad know about us?」

Marika
「Yeah, I told my mom in secret... Oh, but I didn't talk about the bump-bump, okay!?」

％Ｂ
「I-I know that!」
Marika
「But I didn't tell my dad～ I know he'd be against it for sure... He might keel over from the shock...」


％Ｂ
「He'd really keel over?」
Marika
「Yeah.」
That'd be problematic too.
Marika
「That's why my mom said that we should keep it a secret from my dad for a while. But my mom supports us.」


％Ｂ
「Oh, okay. That's good.」
It's heartening to know that at least one of them is on our side.
％Ｂ
「Then maybe I should at least go say hi to your mom?」

Marika
「Huh? Directly?」
％Ｂ
「You've already told her, right? Wouldn't she think of me as irresponsible if I didn't go introduce myself as your boyfriend?」

Marika
「I don't think she would... but it makes me really happy that you'd say that. I want you to get along with my mom too.」


Marika
「I'd like it if you could get along with my dad too, but...」
％Ｂ
「I'll do my best so that I can someday.」
Though it looks like it'll be difficult.
％Ｂ
「Your dad aside, I might wanna at least have a proper talk with your mom.」

Marika
「...Want to come over today, then? My dad said he'd be home late today too.」

％Ｂ
「Uh... Today?」
I know she's apparently in favor of our relationship, but doing it this suddenly would make me a bit nervous...

Marika
「Oh... Too sudden?」
％Ｂ
「No, I'll come. It's better to do stuff like that early on.」

Marika
「Okay, so then let's...」
all
Yumi
「Oh, Marika?」
Marika
「Wha... Mom.」
Y-You're kidding me... We just happened to run into her mom at a time like this... What do I...?

all
％Ｂ
「U-Uhh, Mother dearest.」
Yumi
「Mother dearest?」
Marika
「W-Wah! Calm down!」
％Ｂ
「R-Right...」
Not good. I got freaked out from the sudden encounter.
I need to calm down.
all
％Ｂ
「G-Good evening.」
Yumi
「Good evening. I was just getting groceries for dinner today. Why don't you join us tonight?」


％Ｂ
「Huh? Dinner? But...」
Yumi
「You're living alone anyway, aren't you? And my husband's going to be home late today, so there's no need to worry.」

％Ｂ
「N-No, I'm not worried about...」
Yumi
「It's decided, then. Marika, you help with dinner today, okay?」

Marika
「Yep, leave it to me～♪」
％Ｂ
「I'll take you up on your offer, then...」
Yumi
「How is it?」
％Ｂ
「This is amazing!!」
It's genuinely delicious. No flattery involved.
Yumi
「Whose food do you like better? Marika's or mine?」
％Ｂ
「Huh? Uh...」
H-How am I supposed to answer that?
They're both delicious anyway, choosing between them would be...
Marika
「Geez, you don't need to ask things like that, Mom! Look, he doesn't know what to say～ They're both good, aren't they?」


％Ｂ
「Y-Yeah, of course! They're both delicious!」
Yumi
「Ufufu. What a kind boyfriend.」
％Ｂ
「B-Boyfriend...」
Marika
「Geez, Mom, don't tease him...」
all
Yumi
「I can't help it, you two are just so innocent.」
Getting teased by your girlfriend's mom is pretty rough, huh.
...Though it does make me happy.
Yumi
「If Marika's calling you by name, then I think I'll do the same. What do you like about Marika, Ryousuke-kun?」

Yumi
「What do you like about Marika?」
％Ｂ
「Huh? Well, uh...」
Marika
「Geez, come on, Mom～」
％Ｂ
「She's cute, she's girly, she always tries her best... I was attracted to that earnest side of her...」

Marika
「Y-You don't need to answer seriously～! It's embarrassing...」

Yumi
「Looks like he loves you a lot.」
Marika
「G-Geez～」
Marika's shrunk down, bright red.
Yumi
「You don't need to blush that much. You're happy.」

Marika
「I am, but...」
all
％Ｂ
「E-Excuse me...!」
I stand up as the tides of conversation change.
％Ｂ
「It's a bit late, but I feel like I need to make a proper announcement, so...」

％Ｂ
「I'm sure you're already aware, but I'm in a relationship with your daughter!」

I say it all at once.
Silence falls over the table for an instant.
Was it too sudden after all?
Yumi
「Ufufu. How very proper of you.」
Her mom smiles.
I feel the tension leave my shoulders in relief when I see that smile.
Yumi
「Yes, I've already heard from Marika. My daughter may not be perfect, but I hope we get along from now on.」

％Ｂ
「N-No, that's not... Um, I also hope we get along well.」

Marika
「But we should keep it a secret from Dad still, right? When do you think we should tell him?」

Yumi
「That'll have to be when you two get married.」
％Ｂ
「Huh? Married...?」
Yumi
「I doubt he'd be okay with it unless it were in the middle of something like that. That's just what a father is like about his daughter.」


all
％Ｂ
「Is that so...」
But I dunno if the idea of keeping quiet about our relationship all the way until then sits well with me.\n\r

Though I doubt we'll see each other that often...
Kouji
「Heeey, I'm hooome.」
Or I guess we're gonna see each other right now!?
Marika
「Huh? Dad's home? Isn't he a bit early?」
Yumi
「He is. Just a minute.」
Marika
「Geez... He only ever comes home early at times like these.」

％Ｂ
「What should I do?」
Marika
「You're fine just staying put. You can stand tall and proud, since we invited you over.」

％Ｂ
「S-Sure.」
But it'll still be awkward, right?
I wonder what kinda face her dad is going to make when he sees me.
all
Kouji
「Man, the rain came down earlier than it was supposed to. That's why I'm home early.」

He steps into the room, brushing rain off of his work clothes.
I stand up and lower my head toward him.
Kouji
「...Hm?」
％Ｂ
「P-Please excuse me for the intrusion.」
Kouji
「If I remember correctly, you're...」
His face is stiff and tense.
He's really wary of me, isn't he...
Kouji
「...What are you doing here at a time like this?」
Marika
「Don't say it like thaaat. Can't you tell? We invited him over for dinner.」

Kouji
「Invited him? It's not a party or anything. It's no one's birthday, and it's not any kind of anniversary either.」

Marika
「It's fine to invite him over at other times, isn't it?」
Kouji
「And you should think things over as well. You might've been invited, but if a boy just goes over to the house of a girl his age...」


Marika
「It's okay, isn't it? Ryousuke-kun's...」
Marika
「It's okay, isn't it? He's...」
Kouji
「Ryousuke-kun? When did you start calling him by his first name?」
Marika
「Um, well...」
Uh, I feel like the conversation's taken a bad turn...
Uh, I feel like the conversation's taken a bad turn...
Is Marika... Is she going to...?
Marika
「Because Ryousuke-kun's... He's important to me...」
Marika
「Because he's... He's important to me...」
Kouji
「I-Important to you... as what!?」
Marika
「He's important to me as... As...」
Marika, you're not... You're not gonna just say it, are you?
Kouji
「He...He's important to you as a friend, right!?」
Marika
「Huh?」
all
Kouji
「Right? I know already! I've seen through everything!」
Yumi
「Looks like he caved to the pressure. He's so timid.」
Kouji
「I see, I see, a friend! You're on good terms, but there's nothing more to the relationship! That's what being friends is, and that's what you are!」


Kouji
「Isn't that right!? Say it is!」
％Ｂ
「Th-That's right... She's a very important friend...」
Yumi
「Oh dear, it looks like he caved to the pressure too. Men are all so timid.」

Marika
「Geez... Dad, just hurry up and go change! You'll catch a cold like that!」


all
Kouji
「N-Now just wait a second! There's still more I need to... Aaaahh～～」

$$smh_OpenCHK
％Ｂ
「I'm very sorry you had to come all the way here to see me off after your hospitality. Your food was very delicious.」

Marika and Yumi-san escorted me to a little before my house.
The rain stopped for a bit, and now it's just a slightly humid wind blowing.
Yumi
「Don't worry about what happened, and come again, okay?」
％Ｂ
「Ahaha, I'd love to.」
Yumi
「I'm sorry about that annoying husband of mine. He cares about his daughter, and he's a bit eccentric. He's more normal usually.」

％Ｂ
「Oh no, I can tell.」
I'm sure he's worried about Marika.
I was the same way until just recently... 
So it makes sense that, as her father, he'd be even more worried than I was.
Marika
「But he worries too much～ I'm not a child anymore.」

Yumi
「You'll always be my and your father's child.」
Marika
「That's true, but...」
all
Yumi
「Are you sure you don't need an umbrella?」
％Ｂ
「No, it shouldn't be necessary. My house is close by.」
The rain's stopped for now, but it could start back up at any moment.
But I should still be fine without an umbrella.
Marika
「There's apparently a hurricane coming～ I didn't know at all, since I didn't watch the forecast.」

％Ｂ
「Same here.」
I've only been thinking about the Tanabata Festival these last few weeks.
％Ｂ
「Looks like I should get going.」
Marika
「So what should we do about tomorrow?」
％Ｂ
「Good point... Depends on what happens with the hurricane, but it might be best for us to work from home instead of school. I'll contact everyone tomorrow morning.」


Marika
「Okay. Be careful on the way home, then.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. Goodbye, then. Again, the food was great.」
all
Yumi
「Come over again, okay?」
I walk away, Marika and her mother smiling at me from behind.
I look up at the sky. Lead-colored clouds are flying across the sky, but it's almost unpleasantly quiet.\n\r

Is this what they call the calm before the storm?
Might be best to just stay at home tomorrow.
