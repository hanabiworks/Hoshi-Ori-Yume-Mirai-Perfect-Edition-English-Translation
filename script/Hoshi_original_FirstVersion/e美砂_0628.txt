And so, it's finally Saturday.
Today's the day we're going to try out that plan with the kids.
The preparations are already done. The stickers of the fish and clams that Okihara-senpai and Shinozaki put so much effort into drawing are stuck to the bottom of the pool.


Misa
「I'm starting to get nervous...」
Okihara-senpai and I are going to watch what happens from a little further away.
％Ｂ
「It'll be okay. I'm sure the kids will be interested in them, after you two tried so hard to draw them.」

Misa
「It would be nice if they did...」
all
Tweet, tweet♪ Tweet, tweet♪
％Ｂ
「Oh, here they come.」
The sound of a large group of kids excitedly approaching follows the cheerful whistling.

Marika
「Don't run, everyone! Okay, now everyone stop!」

Tweeeet♪
Shinozaki's guiding the kids alongside the instructor.

Marika
「Umm... Okay, then let's start the swimming class. We have something special today―」

Boy B
「Ohh! There's something inside the pool!」
The kids all peer into the pool after one of the boys immediately spots something.

Girl A
「You're right! There's something there!」
Boy C
「What are those? What is iiit?」
Marika
「W-Well... Today's different because there's―」

Boy B
「Let's go in!」
Marika
「Oh, h-hey, it'd be nice if you could wait a little～! I need to explain―\nOh, h-hey～! No jumping in already!」


all
The kids all start getting in the pool without listening to Shinozaki.
％Ｂ
「Looks like it's a real hit...」
After a bit, the boy that jumped in first surfaces.
Boy B
「Pfah! Whoa! There's pretty fish in here!」
Girl B
「There was an octopus and a crab, too!」
Boy C
「That's so cool! I'm gonna dive under again!」
Girl A
「Me too!」
The kids dive into the water one after another.
Boy A
「...」
But there's just one boy still waiting by the poolside.
％Ｂ
「Oh... That kid's...」
He's the one who was running around the pool because he didn't wanna get in when I was here before.
％Ｂ
「So he's the one Shinozaki was talking about.」
Marika
「Hey... Aren't you going to go in? The others say there's something in the water. Don't you want to see what it is?」

Shinozaki approaches him and gently talks to him.
Boy A
「...Opening my eyes underwater... is scary.」
Marika
「Don't worry, you can use these. Tada! Swim goggles～♪ I think these will help you keep your eyes open underwater.」


Boy A
「...」
Shinozaki holds the goggles out to him.
But it looks like he's still hesitant.
Marika
「I'll put them on for you, then.」
She places the swim goggles on his head.
Marika
「Okay, come here. Let's try looking in the water to see what it's like, okay?」

all
Misa
「Will he go in the water...?」
％Ｂ
「He will... I'm sure of it.」
His curiosity's gotta win out over his fear of the water!
Boy A
「...!」
He steels himself and enters the water.
Misa
「Oh... He went in!」
Marika
「Let's put our faces under the water and see what's there next.」

Boy A
「B-But...」
Marika
「Don't worry. Look, everyone else is okay, right?」
Boy B
「Bhah! There's a turtle too!」
Girl A
「That blue fish is so pretty!」
Marika
「...Do you not want to see the fish?」
Boy A
「I-I wanna see!」
Marika
「Then let's put your face in the water just a bit! I'll hold you up, okay?」

Boy A
「O-Okay... Hold me properly, okay?」
Marika
「Leave it to me!」
Shinozaki places her hands on him. He takes a deep breath, and puts his face under for just an instant.

Boy A
「Bhah!」
Marika
「How was it? Did you see something?」
Boy A
「I did! I saw a fish!」
Marika
「You saw a fish? What kind of fish?」
Boy A
「I couldn't really tell...」
Marika
「Then maybe we could try putting your face in the water long enough to see what fish it is this time?」
Boy A
「Okay!」
all
And he places his face in the water again.
For longer this time.
Boy A
「Pfahhh! I saw a blue fish! And a weird fish too!」
Marika
「A-A weird fish...?」
...That must be one of the ones Shinozaki drew.
Boy A
「I wanna see more! I'm gonna dive more!」
Marika
「Then I'll make sure you―ah!」
He dives back under all by himself.
％Ｂ
「Oh!」
Boy A
「Pfah! There's a clam too! And a turtle! And a starfish!」
Marika
「O-Oh really～」
Even Shinozaki seems surprised.
The other instructors who were watching are all looking at each other with wide eyes too.

all
Boy B
「Hey, come look at what's over here too!」
Boy A
「O-Okay!」
He dives into the water all on his own. It's hard to believe he was so afraid earlier.

Marika
「...Ehe.」
Shinozaki smiles over at us after she gets over her surprise and does a fist pump.

I give her a thumbs-up in response.
all
Misa
「Thank goodness. It seems everything went well.」
％Ｂ
「Oh no... It didn't just go well, it went great!」
I'm surprised that it worked this well too.
％Ｂ
「That kid really was afraid of the water. He was running around all over the pool trying to escape when I saw him here last time.」

Misa
「Is that so?」
％Ｂ
「I can't believe he'd go underwater himself... This was an amazing idea.」

Misa
「...To tell you the truth, I also used to be afraid of the water as a child.」

％Ｂ
「Wha...?」
Misa
「That method is something that my parents thought of for me to get over my fear of water. Though they used genuine fish for me...」


Misa
「That was also the beginning of my love for the ocean. And maybe this... could be the start of that boy loving the ocean too?」


％Ｂ
「Maybe... I think I might've gotten hooked on the ocean if I had experienced something like that.」

Misa
「...Would you like to try it now, then?」
％Ｂ
「Huh?」
Misa
「I actually have one sticker left over.」
all
She pulls one out from inside her bag.

％Ｂ
「Oh... That's a juvenile yellowtail wrasse.」
Misa
「I made it, but I decided not to use it because it was a little small.」

all
She peels the backing off of the sticker and sticks it on her cheek.
Misa
「Yellowtail wrasses are a very rare find! Do you think you'll be able to catch one?」

all
She then submerges herself in the general-purpose pool.
She begins swimming through the water smoothly.
％Ｂ
「All right!」
I get in the pool too.
I swim after her as fast as I can.
Maybe she's swimming slowly on purpose, but I catch up to her faster than expected.

...She said I should catch her, right?
I line up next to her while maintaining my speed and gently capture her by hugging her as she swims.

％Ｂ
「Pfah... I-I've caught you!」
Squish.
％Ｂ
「Uh...?」
I feel something very soft and comfortable in my hand. Is this...?

Misa
「U-Um, that isn't my cheek...」
％Ｂ
「Aaaaghh!? I-I'm so sorry!」
％Ｂ
「T-That wasn't on purpose! You told me to catch you, so I―」

Misa
「...」
I-Is she... Is she angry?
Misa
「...Hehe. You won't be able to catch me if you're being that hesitant.」
％Ｂ
「Wha...?」
Misa
「Now then!」
all
She sinks to the bottom of the pool with a small splash.
She turns, and starts swimming away smoothly.
％Ｂ
「Agh! Wait... Please wait!」
Misa
「Ahahahahaha! You won't be able to catch a yellowtail wrasse that easily!」

％Ｂ
「Khhh... Then I'm gonna get serious!」
Misa
「Kyaaaahhh...!?」
I know I'm way too old for this, but I'm enjoying our game of water tag a lot.
