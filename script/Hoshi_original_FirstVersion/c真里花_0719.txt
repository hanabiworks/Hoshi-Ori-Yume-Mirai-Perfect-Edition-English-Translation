「I got suggestions from the staff at Mr. Azuma's architectural firm, and brushed up the blueprints.」

I'm showing the new design suggestions to the others.
I spent all night drawing it up, taking all of the suggestions into account.
Natsuki
「That looks good. Looks like it's more polished now?」
％Ｂ
「They did a good job smoothing over the rougher parts of our ideas.」

Misa
「I may not be familiar with the industry specifics, but it does look very professional.」
％Ｂ
「It really does. I learned that every detail is important.」


all
Marika
「Yeah, I think it looks a lot better now～」

Touko
「But doesn't this mean we need a lot more stuff now?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, it does. We'll need to manage it with our limited budget.」

all
％Ｂ
「And so I was thinking of going out shopping for supplies in the afternoon...」
Marika
「Oh, then I'll come with.」
Marika immediately raises her hand.
That's my girlfriend for you.
My girlfriend...
Can't really stop myself from smiling when I think about it.
all
％Ｂ
「Uhh, so it'll be just us two. Is that all right with you guys?」
Touko
「That doesn't matter. We wouldn't want to get in the way of your date.」

％Ｂ
「No... We're just going shopping.」

Marika
「Y-Yeah～ It's for the Tanabata Festival.」
Natsuki
「But if it's you two together, then it's a date no matter what. We'd be like summer bugs flying into a fire if we tried to tag along.」


％Ｂ
「I have no idea what that means.」
Marika
「Auh...」
Looks like there's no choice but for us two to go alone.
Not that I have a problem with that.
...In fact, this is perfect.
Marika
「We're going to make it that big～?」
She widens her eyes at the size of the acrylic hemispheres in my hand.
They're big enough that Marika might have to hold them in both hands.
％Ｂ
「We'll be able to project lots of stars this way. Though it'll be more work to make all the holes.」

Marika
「We're going to have to cover the surface with small holes, right? Yeah, that's going to be a lot of work. But I'm sure it'll be doable if we all split the workload together!」


Marika
「And that light bulb's so big too.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, it is.」
I ordered it from the electrician's and had them acquire it for me.
It's big enough that it looks like it'll be a few times brighter than a normal incandescent bulb.
％Ｂ
「They apparently use these for studio spotlights. I bet this'll let us project even the small stars all the way across the room.」

Marika
「We'll have to do our best making the holes for the stars, then!」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. Let's work hard and make it amazing. Let's see, was this all we needed...?」

Marika
「Oh... Can we stop by that 100-yen store really quick? I'll be done in a minute, so it'd make me happy if you waited here. Since you have lots of bags.」


％Ｂ
「Got it.」
Marika
「I'll be right back then～」
all
Marika goes running off.
％Ｂ
「...Hm?」
I look around to see that I'm standing in front of a drugstore.
I feel like there was something I needed to buy here...
all
％Ｂ
「Oh.」
I remember now. From back when we were kissing in my room.
％Ｂ
「I should probably buy some... right?」
I don't know when it'll happen, of course.
I need to make sure I have them ready when it does, as a man.
...Marika isn't back yet.
％Ｂ
「...All right. Now's the time.」
％Ｂ
「I-I bought them...」
I was crazy nervous, but I managed to buy them.
I didn't have the presence of mind to calmly pick one out. The packaging says "Nice and thin" on it.

％Ｂ
「Kinda weirdly graphic... Maybe she's gonna think I'm creepy, 'cause it looks like I'm dying to do it...」

But I can't just go and return it now...
Marika
「Sorryyy, thanks for waiting!」
％Ｂ
「Aaagh!?」
Marika
「Kyah!? ...Wh-What's wrong? Why were you so surprised?」
％Ｂ
「N-No reason, okay!? No reason at all!」
Marika
「R-Really? But... why is your face so red...?」
％Ｂ
「N-No, it's really no reason, okay!? I had no impure feelings or anything...!」

Marika
「Impure feelings?」
％Ｂ
「I-I mean...」
Crap. The more I talk, the more suspicious I seem.
％Ｂ
「Anyway, you done with your shopping?」
Marika
「Yeah, I am.」
％Ｂ
「Then let's go.」
Marika
「Okay, let's go.」
...Maybe I should've gone for something more innocuous after all?
