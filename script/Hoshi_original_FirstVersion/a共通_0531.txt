26 degrees?
I heard it was supposed to be cooler over here, but I guess that's not the case for summer.
Though I hear it's hot everywhere this time of the year.
What was it like when I lived in Shionagi way back then?
I can't really remember.
It's been seven years already, huh?
I've really returned...
To Shionagi City. The town where I was born.
Bus Driver
『The next stop will be Minamigawa and 5th Street. Minamigawa and 5th Street. If you would like to get off, please press a nearby button.』

...Looks like things have changed a lot around here.
There weren't any shops like this back when I lived in this city. Looks like the town's developed more.\n\r
I guess it'd be weird if nothing had changed, seeing how it's been seven years.
？？？／涼介
（...So where am I getting off again?）
I pull my smartphone out from my pocket and check the map.
？？？／涼介
（Right. Izumigaoka and 3rd Street.）
Once I arrive at Shionagi Airport, I take the shuttle to Shionagi Station.
I take a connecting bus from there to Izumigaoka and 3rd Street.
And from there, my destination's a five-minute walk away.
Bus Driver
「This is Minamigawa and 5th Street. It appears there are no passengers getting off at this stop? We will be passing it, then.」

I check the list of stops that's set up inside the bus.
Looks like it'll be a while before we get to Izumagaoka and 3rd Street.\n\r
I put my phone back in my pocket and look out the window again.
It's been almost three hours since I left Kanagawa.
I don't travel much, so I'm starting to get a bit tired.
My eyelids naturally begin to droop as I recline in my seat.
？？？／涼介
「...Whoops... Wouldn't be good if I fell asleep.」
I'd be in all kinds of trouble if I missed my stop.
？？？／涼介
「Hm... That place is...」
I can see a campsite far away out the window.
I'm pretty sure I've been to that campsite before.
Yeah... I'm pretty sure...
It was seven years ago, right before I left Shionagi...
It was summer break. Me, a bunch of other kids, and all our parents were there...
Science Teacher
「Okay now everyone, attention please!」
Science Teacher
「Hey, everyone! I understand why you'd be occupied with the barbecue, but eyes on me for a moment! Eyes on me!」


...None of the kids listened to what the adults were saying.
We were all excited from being at a campground at night, and more importantly, we were all focused on eating barbecue.

Science Teacher
「The real reason we had you come here with your moms and dads isn't to eat barbecue. It's to watch the Perseid meteor shower!」


『Summer Break Family Stargazing: Let's All Watch the Perseid Meteor Shower!』
That was the actual name of this gathering.
Science Teacher
「The time when you can see the most meteors is called the "peak." This year's peak is August 13th, which is today. Today's the day we'll be able to see the greatest number of meteors.」


Science Teacher
「And what's more, we're apparently very lucky this year, as they predict that we should be able to see almost double the number of meteors as we would on another year.」

Science Teacher
「That number is sixty over the course of an hour! What do you think!? Isn't it amazing? It is, isn't it!?」

Science Teacher
「Now then, I'll explain what you should be on the lookout for!」
Most of the kids were still entirely focused on eating barbecue while the teacher was talking.

？？？／涼介
「Hmm...」
As for me, well, I wasn't listening either.
But it's not like I was just tearing into the food either.
I was just sitting there, looking around.
？？？／涼介
（...Where the heck are they?）
The reason for that was because my friend who was supposed to come here with me hadn't shown up yet.

？？？／涼介
（It's the last time we'll see each other...）
Science Teacher
「Now then, before we begin stargazing, I have a very important message for all of you.」
Science Teacher
「One of our friends here with us today is actually going to move away from Shionagi City soon.」

Science Teacher
「For him, this stargazing event will be his last memory of this school.」

Strangely enough, the kids who hadn't been listening at all earlier were now all quiet.

Science Teacher
「We're all here today to stargaze together. I'd like to have him say his goodbyes before he leaves.」

I breathe in. I thought this might happen.
I already had a farewell party with my classmates before summer break.
I felt like there wasn't really any point in saying goodbye to students in other years or to adults at this point.

Science Teacher
「Now then, come up to the front, and let's say our goodbyes!」
I reluctantly started to walk up to the front, but then―

？？？／涼介
「...Hm?」
Something rained down from the sky.
A few of the kids, me included, looked up.
Younger Kid
「A star fell from the sky!」
I felt like I could see the sparkle of a shooting star.
And then the rumble of thunder drowned out our teacher's reply, and it immediately began raining.
Science Teacher
「Everyone, let's move to somewhere with a roof! Parents, please help put out the barbecue fire!」

We all got a bit panicked from the sudden thunderstorm.
Though thanks to that, I didn't have to say any unnecessary goodbyes.
The kids all ran toward cover while getting pelted by the rain.
I stood still, looking up at the sky.
What I saw earlier was just a raindrop reflecting the light.
...There weren't any shooting stars to be seen.
？？？／涼介
「Nh...」
Crap... Looks like I fell asleep...
？？？／涼介
「Fuaaahhh... Afhh...」
Bus Driver
『Next is Kuzuhadai. Kuzuhadai is next. Those getting off here, please press a nearby button.』

？？？／涼介
「...Kuzuhadai?」
Uh... Wait a second...
Wasn't I supposed to get off at Izumigaoka and 3rd...?
？？？／涼介
「Ack! We're five stops past it!」
Bus Driver
「This is Kuzuhadai. There appear to be no passengers getting off here?」
？？？／涼介
「W-Wait! I'm getting off!」
$$smh_OpenCHK
？？？／涼介
「Now I've done it... Okay. I need to check when the next bus going the other way's coming.」

I cross to the other side of the road and look at the schedule.
？？？／涼介
「You're kidding me, an hour? Man... I'm gonna need to kill time somewhere.」
I take a look around, but it's all just houses around me.
？？？／涼介
「Hm? That's... I'm pretty sure...」

I can see part of a white wall behind the trees on the roadside.
I have a vague feeling I've seen it before.
I feel like I saw it really recently...
？？？／涼介
「...Guess I might as well go and check it out.」
？？？／涼介
「I knew it. So this is it. I thought I'd seen it before.」

The gates have the words "Shionagi First Academy" engraved onto them.
I've seen this exact view on a pamphlet before.
Right. This is the school I'm transferring to.
A cool breeze wafts over me.
？？？／涼介
「...Hm?」
Something glittery flutters into my field of view while I'm looking at the school building.

It sways left and right, as if the wind were playing with it...
$$smh_OpenCHK
？？？／涼介
「...A star?」
And I eventually grab it.
？？？／涼介
「A star came falling down from the sky...」
It's made of gold origami paper. It's clearly meant to be a star.
？？？／涼介
「...Where'd this come from?」
I look up at the roof. There's a silhouette leaning out a bit over the railings, looking down at me.

？？？／涼介
「...Did they drop this?」
I can't see their face because of the sun.
They're looking all around the area, as if they hadn't noticed me.
I look at the star-shaped folded paper again.
There are words written on the back.
"I wish to see you again."
What a vague wish.
I decide I might as well enter the school.
？？？／涼介
「I should probably go give this to whoever dropped it...」
Academy Employee
「Oh? Do you need something?」
？？？／涼介
「Uh...」
Looks like I've run into a faculty member instead of the owner of the star.
She seems curious as to why I'm here in casual clothes.
？？？／涼介
「Uhh, I'm going to be transferring into this school...」
School Employee
「...Oh, are you here on a school visit?」
？？？／涼介
「What? Well... I guess you could call it that, yes.」
School Employee
「Wait just a second, then.」
School Employee
「Please write your name into this check-in sheet, then.」
？？？／涼介
「Uh huh...」
She's holding out a binder full of forms to me.
I guess it makes sense that they wouldn't want just anyone walking around here.

「Ohh, you're the transfer student.」
School Employee
「Now please put this form in this lanyard and wear it around your neck. Don't take it off while you're on school grounds, okay?」
School Employee
「Today's Saturday, so you can take a look at whatever you'd like. Please return the check-in form to the office before you leave.」

％Ｂ
「Okay.」
The woman leaves after her explanation.
％Ｂ
「Now then...」
How do I get up on the roof?
$$smh_OpenCHK
I climb up the dark stairwell and push open the heavy door.
There's a wide-open sky before me.
％Ｂ
「Mmmm～ That feels good.」
There's a pleasant breeze blowing. It feels different from how it felt on the ground.
I bet lunch would taste better up here.
Getting to nap up here would be perfect too.
％Ｂ
「I can see the whole town from here too. This is a great spot.」
％Ｂ
「Now then, to find the person who dropped this...」
？？？／そら
「...」
％Ｂ
「...Hm?」
I sense someone behind me. I turn around.
？？？／そら
「...」
％Ｂ
「Whoa!?」
There's a female student standing right behind me.
？？？／そら
「...」
She's standing there silently, a hood over her head.
She's wearing some weird sunglasses too.
Wh-What's going on here!?
？？？／そら
「...」
％Ｂ
「Oh... Is this yours?」
I hold out the star.
％Ｂ
「Did you drop this?」
？？？／そら
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「I'm glad I found the owner without too much of a problem. Here you go, then.」

？？？／そら
「...Thanks.」
She gently accepts the star.
％Ｂ
「Uhh...」
？？？／そら
「...」
all
I'm trying to think of some question to ask her when she turns away from me and starts messing with something.

％Ｂ
「Oh...」
It's an astronomy telescope.
％Ｂ
「That telescope's huge. I've never seen one like that before.」
？？？／そら
「...You can see up to 14th-magnitude stars.」
She's tying the star-shaped origami to the telescope.
That's when I get it.
％Ｂ
「Ohh... I get it now. That was a tanzaku. That's why there's a wish written on it.」

？？？／そら
「...」
No reply this time.
％Ｂ
「Can you see stars in the middle of the day like this?」
No reply again.
Looks like she doesn't talk much.
？？？／そら
「...」
％Ｂ
「...Hm?」
She gently takes off the sunglasses.
The hood of her sweater flutters in the breeze.
％Ｂ
「...Oh...」
She turns her uncovered face toward me.
My heart jumps in response.
What the heck...
She's pretty cute...
？？？／そら
「...」
She looks my way, one hand on the telescope that she just finished tying the star too.

Maybe she's trying to tell me to see for myself about whether I can see stars?

％Ｂ
「...Can I take a look?」
？？？／そら
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「...I just look in through here, right?」
％Ｂ
「Whoa!?」
I couldn't help but cry out.
I can see a pale blue moon, shining bigger than I've ever seen before.

％Ｂ
「This is awesome! I can see all the bumps on the moon!」
I've seen photos of this on the internet and stuff.
But it's completely different seeing it with your own eyes like this.
％Ｂ
「What the heck? I didn't know these telescopes were this awesome! All I can say is "awesome." These bumps are awesome!」

？？？／そら
「...Craters.」
％Ｂ
「...Wha?」
？？？／そら
「...Not bumps. Craters.」
？？？／そら
「...Craters are depressions formed from impacts from asteroids or comets. Some theories say that they also might be the remnants of volcanic activity.」

％Ｂ
「Huh... Really... Do you know a lot about the moon?」
？？？／そら
「Its diameter is 3,474 kilometers. The fifth biggest satellite in the solar system. It's 384,400 kilometers away from Earth. Its rotational and revolutional periods are both 27 days, 7 hours and 43 minutes, so you can't see the other side from Earth.」













？？？／そら
「──Its gravity is approximately a sixth of Earth's. 110 degrees centigrade by day, -170 by night. One day on the moon is twenty-nine days on Earth.」


％Ｂ
「...Wow. I'm surprised.」
？？？／そら
「...*nod*」
？？？／そら
「...I was too... when I first saw the moon...」
％Ｂ
「Well, the moon surprised me too, but I was talking about you. You know a lot about astronomy.」

？？？／そら
「...Because... I like it.」
％Ｂ
「...Uh...」
She was talking about astronomy, but I can't help but react a bit.

？？？／そら
「...Is something the matter?」
％Ｂ
「No, it's nothing.」
？？？／そら
「...?」
％Ｂ
「Uh... Uhh, right, so I'm a transfer student. I'll be attending this school starting next week. We should talk about astronomy again sometime, if you're okay with it.」


？？？／そら
「...*nod*」
？？？／そら
「...It's a promise.」
She then starts packing up the telescope.
Looks like that's the end of stargazing for today.
％Ｂ
「Want me to help?」
？？？／そら
「...」
She's as quiet as ever, but she hasn't said she doesn't need my help, either.
I decide to help her.
all
The two of us leave after putting away the telescope.
I'm holding the telescope case. It's pretty heavy.
％Ｂ
「I'm surprised you managed to carry something this heavy up to the roof.」
Maybe she's strong, despite her small frame?
％Ｂ
「Hm?」
Once I start down the stairs, she takes out a key behind me and starts locking up the steel doors to the rooftop.

％Ｂ
「You're locking up?」
？？？／そら
「...The rooftop is off limits.」
％Ｂ
「Huh, really... Wait, wha... Is it really?」

I figured it was normally open to students, because of how easy it was for me to get up there.
Here I was thinking it was a nice place to be, too...
％Ｂ
「So why do you have a key to the rooftop, then?」
？？？／そら
「...I'm special.」
％Ｂ
「...Special?」
？？？／そら
「Because I'm in the astronomy club.」
％Ｂ
「...The astronomy club?」
？？？／そら
「...*nod*」
all
We return the telescope to the astronomy clubroom.
She said she was going to stay behind to record her stargazing data for the day, so I left.

％Ｂ
「Oh. Now that I think about it, I forgot to ask her for her name...」
Was she an underclassman?
She was a bit eccentric...
But she was pretty cute.
Especially when she smiled while talking about the moon and stuff.
％Ｂ
「Hm... What's going on there?」
_00cutinBS
There's a girl moving strangely near the stairwell.
She's slowly inching backward. Her posture suggests she's carrying something.
She's moving toward the descending stairs...
...There's no way she hasn't noticed that, right?
％Ｂ
「No way... Yeah right... There's no way―」
_00cutinBS
The girl's heel slips down the top step.
？？？／夏希
「Haeh?」
％Ｂ
「Hey... Watch out!」
The girl falls off balance and slowly topples over backwards.

I sprint up the stairs on reflex and wrap my arms around her from behind to catch her.

──But...
I feel my own center of balance shift as well.
I can't pitch myself forward. My own posture's too messed up.
And so, like you'd expect...
％Ｂ
「Whoa... Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoah!?」

？？？／夏希
「Kyah!?」
──We fall.
％Ｂ
「Gueh!?」
％Ｂ
「Ughhh...」
My breathing stops for a moment when I land on my back.
？？？／夏希
「Ahhh... That scared me. But I got the shot, so it's all okay. Oh, hey. Are you okay?」


％Ｂ
「Pre...Pretty much...」
？？？／夏希
「I see. Looks like you saved me.」
％Ｂ
「You're very welcome. Actually, why were you walking backward down the stairs?」

％Ｂ
「It's a good thing I just happened to be passing by. That was really dangerous, you know.」

？？？／夏希
「Oh, it was for this.」
She shows me the camera in her hand.
？？？／夏希
「I was taking a photo. I found the perfect angle to use for a frontispiece, so I forgot about everything else around me.」


...Frontispiece?
？？？／夏希
「There was this bird perched on the windowsill. So I was thinking of getting a shot of the moment when it spread its wings to fly. Click!」

％Ｂ
「And so that led to you tipping over... Either way, I'm glad you weren't hurt.」

？？？／夏希
「You think you can move?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah... Once you get off of me, at least.」
？？？／夏希
「Right, that makes sense! But first, I think I'd appreciate it if you moved your hand.」

％Ｂ
「...My hand?」
？？？／夏希
「Yeah. You're touching me, you know.」
％Ｂ
「Wha... Touching...?」
Now that she mentions it, there's something warm and soft against my hand.
Is this...?
％Ｂ
「This is... S-Sorry! That wasn't on purpose!」

I frantically pull my hand away from her breast.
She slowly stands up, dusts off her skirt, and extends a hand toward me.

？？？／夏希
「Well, you did save me, so we can say it's water under the bridge.」

％Ｂ
「That'd be great...」
？？？／夏希
「Come on now, hurry and get up.」
％Ｂ
「Ri...Right.」
all
The hand that had touched her breast makes contact with her hand.
I can't help but get unnecessarily nervous.
Regardless, it doesn't look like she's angry.
？？？／夏希
「And it didn't really feel like you had any ill intentions. I wouldn't have been able to guarantee your safety, in more ways than one, if you were like, "Lucky me♪"」


％Ｂ
「Hahaha... Yeah, right... As if I'd do something like that.」
Thank god.
I'm so glad I didn't even move so much as a finger for a moment.
％Ｂ
「...By the way, what frontispiece were you talking about?」
？？？／夏希
「It's for the graduation album. Don't you think a photo of a bird taking flight'd be a good match for people leaving the nest called school?」


％Ｂ
「I get what you're saying, and I agree that it'd be nice. But don't they usually have professionals take photos like that? Or is that the photography club's job here?」


？？？／夏希
「Hmhmh! I'm not in the photography club. No need for me to hide it, I'm a member of the prestigious grad-alb committee!」

％Ｂ
「The prestigious grah-dalb committee?」
？？？／夏希
「Huh? You don't know the grad-alb committee? So you're a first year? Why are you wearing normal clothes, anyway? You're not just some stranger, are you? Should I call for a teacher? Or maybe the police? Should I? Shall I?」

？？？／夏希
「Now that I get a good look at you, I don't recognize you. I'm familiar with most of the students at this school... Guess I really should call for them?」


％Ｂ
「No! Wait! Don't just up and decide that I'm a criminal, please.」

％Ｂ
「I'm going to be attending this school starting next week. I just happened to be close by today, so I came here because I wanted to see what the school was like.」


？？？／夏希
「Ohhh, I see. So that's why you're not wearing a uniform.」
％Ｂ
「I'm glad you understand. So anyway, what's the grah-dalb committee?」

？？？／夏希
「Hm? Okay, I'll explain. Ahem... In a nutshell, the grad-alb committee is the graduation album creation committee!」


％Ｂ
「...Thank you for your simple explanation.」
？？？／夏希
「Hold on, there's still more! Shut up and listen!」

％Ｂ
「Sigh...」
all
To summarize her explanation:
The graduation album creation committee―
Its motto is "Let's create the most fulfilling graduation album we can." Its goal is to take the three years students spend at this school and distill them into photographs.


The "grad-alb committee" has existed since she was a first year. Its members are to bring a camera to any and all school events.


The photos that they take showcase the students' good memories and are bound into a graduation album and given to the graduating students.


According to her, that's "everything there is to know about the grad-alb committee."
％Ｂ
「Huh... That sounds pretty cool.」
？？？／夏希
「Doesn't iiit?」
A graduation album created by students, for students, faithfully depicting good memories of school.
This school does some pretty cool stuff.
？？？／夏希
「You're a transfer student, so the next few weeks'll be pretty exciting. You're starting next week, right? Whatever class you end up in, I'll come take photos of you.」


She smiles and brings the camera up to her eye.
％Ｂ
「You're almost like a newspaper journalist. Am I gonna get an article or something? Like, "Transfer Student Sighted!"」

？？？／夏希
「I already told you I'm in the grad-alb committee. Don't lump me in with the newspaper club. The photos I take are a gift from now, to the future!」

％Ｂ
「Huh...」
A gift from now, to the future... I see.
She says some pretty inspiring stuff.
％Ｂ
「Hm? Is the concert band practicing right now?」
？？？／夏希
「Yep, they always practice in the halls at around this time.」
？？？／夏希
「And so, I'm gonna go take some photos! That's the kind of real-deal daily school life we want! Bye!」

She sprints away down the hall, her eyes glittering.
％Ｂ
「Well, she's a lively one...」
I watch her go. She stops halfway down the hall and turns toward me.

all
_00cutinBS
？？？／夏希
「Right, I forgot to say! Thanks for saving meee♪」
_00cutinBS
She smiles and then resumes running, her skirt fluttering in her wake.

％Ｂ
「What's with that sense of timing?」
There was that girl on the rooftop, and the one just now... This school's got a lot of cute girls.

％Ｂ
「...Though they seem a bit eccentric.」
I'm starting to get excited about transferring here.
％Ｂ
「Phew... I'm finally here.」
I arrive at my house just as the sun's starting to set.
This isn't the house that I used to live in. That's long gone.
This house is one that my father had constructed for us to live in after the move.
％Ｂ
「Mmm～ This is a nice house.」
They showed me the blueprints and model before, but this is the first time I've seen the actual building.\n\r

It's way nicer than the model made it look. It's very dignified.
％Ｂ
「Looks like Dad really put his all into it.」
It's starting to even make me feel emotional.
％Ｂ
「Now then... Let's step in.」
I open up my bag to take out the house key...
％Ｂ
「...Hm?」
There's someone hiding, looking around suspiciously, peering into the house.

％Ｂ
「...What the heck?」
Did one of the neighbors come to say hello? ...But this seems really suspicious.
％Ｂ
「Excuse me... Can I help you?」
？？？／真里花
「Hyah!?」
all
She screams and drops her bag.
Aw, man. Everything's spilling out from inside...
？？？／真里花
「Awawawawa...」
She's frantically picking everything up.
％Ｂ
「Oh geez... I'll help you.」
I also crouch down and gather together the contents of her bag.
％Ｂ
「Here you go.」
？？？／真里花
「I...I'm very sorry... Thank you very much!」
I can't really get a good look at her face because she's bowing her head over and over.
？？？／真里花
「P-Please excuse me!」
％Ｂ
「Hey, wait...!」
She bows her head deeply and sprints away.
...What was up with her?
％Ｂ
「It's just one weird girl after another today.」
％Ｂ
「...Hm?」
There's a flyer at my feet.
％Ｂ
「A guide to using the Shionagi Park pool?」
Looks like an ad for the municipal pool.
I guess it's a recent construction?
Looks pretty fun. There's a lazy river, slides, and so on.
％Ｂ
「I guess that girl dropped this just now?」
I wish I could go chase after her to give her this, but she's nowhere in sight.
I decide to just stuff the flyer into my bag for now.
I wipe the sweat from my forehead after carrying my bags in. I take out my phone.

I need to let Mom back home know that I'm finally here.

『Hello?』
％Ｂ
「Hello? Mom? It's me.」
Mother
『If this is a scam call, we already have enough of whatever you're offering.』
％Ｂ
「It's not a freaking scam call! It's me, ％Ｂ! I just got to the new house!」
Mother
『Oh, really? If you're really him, then you'd know the answer to this. What were the contents of the letter you sent me in kindergarten?』

％Ｂ
「Ughhh... "I'm going to marry Mom when I'm bigger"...」
Mother
『Oh, 
Ryousukeee. 

I'm so happy that you love your mom so much! But you should really be thinking about growing more independent by now, you know.』

％Ｂ
「You're the one who made me say it...」
Mother
『Still, you got there really late. Did you get lost?』
％Ｂ
「No, just decided to tour the city a bit.」
Mother
『So what do you think of the new house? Think there'll be any problems living there?』
％Ｂ
「It's really nice. I like it. Sorry, but I'll be monopolizing this new-house air before you guys show up.」

Mother
『Now that's frustrating... If only your father had been able to finish things up at work, we would've been able to come with you.』

The initial plan was for my family to move here all at once, of course.

Shionagi City's actually where my parents were born too.
I lived here until elementary school.
Our family moved to Kanagawa for my dad's work seven years ago.
But both of my parents really wanted to return to this city. They decided to do it last year, had a house built, and were planning on making their U-turn back here...


Mother
『Looks like things never really go as planned...』
And Mom's right. Things just weren't going to be easy.
We were all supposed to move here together in March, but things apparently wouldn't come to a good stopping point at my dad's work. So my parents both still live in Kanagawa.


My transfer got delayed too, but they decided it wouldn't be good for my school life if it took too long, which is why I got sent here at this weird time of year just on my own.


Mother
『...I'm sorry.』
％Ｂ
「What are you apologizing for all of a sudden?」
Mother
『You're the one who's been having it the worst from the two of us being selfish.』

％Ｂ
「You don't need to worry about stuff like that. I don't think it's too much trouble. Besides, I wanted to move too, remember?」

Mother
『We thought moving back to Shionagi would be good for you, too. But we still ended up making things difficult for you... I'm sorry.』

％Ｂ
「That's not true. I'm glad I got to come back too. And besides, now I get to experience living by myself for a while.」

％Ｂ
「And if you still feel bad about it, then go motivate Dad a little more. 'Cause this house's actually a bit too big for just one person to be living in.」

Mother
『...You've grown so much since I last saw you...』
％Ｂ
「...We literally talked face to face this morning.」
％Ｂ
「Anyway, I'll be waiting for you guys.」
Mother
『Okay. I'll tell your father too. You take care of yourself. Don't get sick or hurt before we get there, okay?』

％Ｂ
「Yeah, I know.」
Mother
『Make sure you eat breakfast, okay? And lunch and dinner, too. Ready-made or instant food's okay once in a while, but not every day, okay?』


％Ｂ
「Yeah, yeah. I know.」
Mother
『You better make sure you take baths too, okay? Not just showers. Get in the water all the way up to your shoulders.』

Mother
『And once you've gotten settled, make sure you go greet the Shinozakis, okay?』

％Ｂ
「Yeah, I will. I've got an intern interview tomorrow morning, so I'll go say hi sometime in the afternoon.」


Mother
『An interview? ...You're going to start working part-time already?』
％Ｂ
「No, it's not a part-time job. It's an internship. I was doing one over there too, remember?」

Mother
『I don't care if it's an internship or a U-turnship. You're still a student. Are you sure you shouldn't be focusing more on your studies than on a part-time job?』


％Ｂ
「No, what I'm saying is that this is so I can study to be an architect.」
I understand why she might be worried, but this is already something I've decided on.
I want to study the work of the architect that I admire now that I'm over here.
％Ｂ
「Anyway, I'll make sure to go to Shinozaki-san's place. I need to start unpacking and cleaning up and stuff, so I'm gonna hang up now. I'll call you again later.」


_smh_st_04
$$smh_OpenCHK
I then hang up without waiting for a response.
I'm grateful that she's worried for me, but still...
％Ｂ
「Now then... I guess I'll start with my room.」
$$smh_OpenCHK
％Ｂ
「Phew... Like this, I guess?」
I've opened up the cardboard boxes that were sent here, and I'm currently organizing my room.
％Ｂ
「It's great having a big room. I can put lots of stuff everywhere.」
Finally, I take out my most precious book from a box.
％Ｂ
「Mmm, beautiful.」
It's an architecture book by the architect I admire most. Azuma Morio.
Azuma Morio's a well-known architect whose office is here in Shionagi.
As you might expect, I'm going to an interview at his office tomorrow.
It wouldn't be exaggerating to say that the results of tomorrow's interview will decide my future.
I'll have to put my all into it.
％Ｂ
「All right! Let's go take a bath and refresh myself!」
％Ｂ
「Aaaaaaghhhh!? It's so cooooold!?」
I spring out into the hallway, soaking wet, on reflex from the unexpectedly cold bathwater.

％Ｂ
「Th-This is just cold water! Why isn't it hot!?」
I know I pressed the switch to start warming the water!
％Ｂ
「Wait a second...」
％Ｂ
「It better not be...!」
I run back to the living room naked and call my parents again.

％Ｂ
「Hello? Hello!?」
Father
『Yes, hello? 
Hino speaking.

』
％Ｂ
「D-Dad? It's me!」
Father
『If this is a scam call, then we already have enough of whatever you're offering.』
％Ｂ
「It's not a scam call already! It's me! ％Ｂ!」
Father
『Then you should know the answer to this question. What were the contents of the letter you sent me when you were in kindergarten?』

％Ｂ
「"My dad's the coolest person in the world"!!!」
Father
『Aw, geez! Now you're making me blush. But you know, you can't just look up to me forever. You've gotta surpass me one day.』


％Ｂ
「Whatever, I get it! It doesn't seem like we've got hot water over here. Do you know what's going on?」


Father
『Ohh... Maybe we haven't contacted the gas company yet? Do you remember?』

Mother
『What? Weren't you going to do it?』
Are you kidding me!?
Father
『...Seems I completely forgot. Whew, my bad. Ahaha!』

This isn't funny!
Father
『Let's see, the gas company's closed now, and they're not open on Sundays, so tomorrow won't work either... So Monday at the earliest, looks like.』


％Ｂ
「Wha... S-So you're saying I have to take cold baths for two days!?」
Father
『You're young. You can just power through it.』
As if!
Father
『Well anyway, that's how it is. You'll have to tough it out for the next two days. I'm gonna go take a bath now, so I'm hanging up.』

％Ｂ
「Wait a...!」
_smh_st_04
...You've gotta be kidding me.
$$smh_OpenCHK
％Ｂ
「Sigh... That was so cold.」
Thank god it's summer.
％Ｂ
「Though I guess a cold bath's refreshing every now and then...」
And now I feel like I'm ready for my interview tomorrow.
I open the window just a bit. A pleasant breeze floats in, like the one I felt up on the school rooftop today.

％Ｂ
「...That feels nice.」
Shionagi City's wind feels clear and comfortable.
Though I might just think so because I just moved here from a hardcore industrial zone.

％Ｂ
「I must've felt this same wind back when I was a kid.」
I feel like the memories I had forgotten will come back to me one by one if I close my eyes.

I'm gonna live with this wind again...
Just like I did before, seven years ago.
