「I hope the weather's gonna be okay...」
$$smh_OpenCHK
There's a hurricane approaching us, according to the news.
It's apparently supposed to pass through the area sometime tonight...
％Ｂ
「All right. Let's get things ready before Touko gets here.」
I've picked out a few easy-looking recipes and printed them out.\n\r

I'm going to have Touko pick one she wants to learn and make it.
I already have a full assortment of seasonings and cooking equipment here.
Being able to pick out the necessary ingredients is a vital part of cooking. We'll go buy them together.
I'm not really that great at cooking... but I should at least be able to teach the basics.

％Ｂ
「We'll need to check the boxes on things to watch out for too. The cooking time and intensity of the heat are important.」

Touko
「Sorry, sorry. I was running late.」
％Ｂ
「What were you doing? You didn't answer my calls and didn't reply on LIME...」

Touko
「Time flew by while I was getting everything ready. The weather's taken a turn for the worse outside, so it was pretty rough getting here.」

％Ｂ
「Well, I don't mind you being late. Come on in.」
Touko
「Mhm. Excuse meee.」
％Ｂ
「I've been wondering... What's in the bag?」
Touko
「Mm, this? It's a secret weapon for today.」
all
She starts rummaging around in her bag.
A secret weapon? ...What's she talking about?
Touko
「Tadaaa! What do you think? Isn't it cute?」
She pulls out an apron with a cute design.

％Ｂ
「Ohh, that's great!」
Touko
「Ehehe, I thought I should get in the spirit of things first. So I prepared matching aprons.」

％Ｂ
「...Wha?」
Matching... As in, Touko and me?
She wants me wearing a cutesy apron like that...?
％Ｂ
「W-Wait! I've already got my own! The sentiment's already more than enough!」

Touko
「Whaaat? ...But I brought it just for you and everything. It'll be really cute.」
％Ｂ
「I don't need it! I don't have any need for cuteness! You can be the only cute one!」

all
Touko
「Hmph...nh, like this...?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, like that... Wait, watch your hands! You're scaring me!」

It's been about thirty minutes since we got back from grocery shopping and I started watching over Touko's cooking.
It's already been pretty bad for my heart.
Touko
「I can't help it... It's hard to cut, and it slips...! Why can't they make them in shapes that are easier to cut...!?」

％Ｂ
「That's just how they're shaped! It should be easy enough with carrots, they're straight!」

The goal here is for Touko to level up her cooking, so my plan is to interfere as little as possible.

But... It looks like she might cut her fingers at any moment. This is seriously bad for the heart.

Touko
「Nnh... This is so hard...! It's such a pain to cut these! Why don't they just sell them precut?」

％Ｂ
「Don't be such a drama queen.」
Touko
「...I don't like cutting things small...! This is pretty much fine, right?」

％Ｂ
「...Those are some thick slices.」
Touko
「It's fine. Having a bit of a harder texture makes it nicer to chew and more delicious.」

％Ｂ
「...You have no idea what you're talking about, do you?」
Touko
「Hey, I'm getting bored of cutting carrots. Let's cut something else.」
％Ｂ
「Cooking isn't just doing what you feel like. Come on, do the other two.」

Touko
「Whaaat～!? Uuuh... Let's do one eeeach. I don't think it's good for me to be the only one doing all the wooork.」

％Ｂ
「There's no point if I do it... You're never gonna get better at cooking like this, you know.」

Touko
「Mmhhh... Fiiine... I think I might end up hating carrots after this... I'm bored of you, so I'll do you lateeer.」

I feel sorry for the carrots.
They're so sweet and tasty too.
Touko
「Aghhh! You bought bell peppers! When did you sneak those in!?」

％Ｂ
「Whoops. You found them.」
Touko
「Just look at that awful green color...! I'm never using these, okay!?」

％Ｂ
「It'll be fine if you cut them into small pieces. I'll cut them for you.」

Touko
「They'll spread the smell and taste! They're going to invade the meat and vegetables! These are the bad guys!」


...They're villains, apparently.
Their bitterness and fragrance are great, though.
Don't worry, bell peppers. I'm on your side.
Touko
「...Onions make you cry when you cut them, right? I don't wanna do this when I know I'm going to cry...」

％Ｂ
「Don't worry, there's a way of doing it without crying. I learned it from a TV show once, so I'll teach you.」

Touko
「Really～ Wow! I didn't know you could do that! Tell me tell me!」

％Ｂ
「Don't cut through all at once. Cut slowly. Push the edge of the knife in and slowly, slowly saw back and forth through it.」


Touko
「Mmh... Like this? Slowly, slowly... Push forward, pull back...!」

％Ｂ
「There we go. You're doing great. There's less of a chance to get hurt this way too, and it's easy to do it well, right?」

Touko
「Mhm. Wow, you're right. I don't feel like crying at all. There's nothing to be scared of.」

％Ｂ
「These are good guys. They turn sweet if you cook them thoroughly, and they taste great.」

Touko
「Ahaha, I think I'll be able to get along with this little guy. Okaaay! Let's keep cutting right on through!」

Touko
「Hot, hooot...! Ow! The oil splattered! Geeeez～ I hate this～」

％Ｂ
「You put in a bit too much oil. Vegetables make oil splatter more 'cause there's water in them.」

Touko
「Tell me that before I put them iiin...! Ow!? What do you have against me～!? All I did was cut you up a bit and cook you～!」


％Ｂ
「You learn how to cook by making mistakes. You'll remember not to do it again 'cause you don't want it to hurt again, right?」

Touko
「I'm already learning iiit～! Oh, the oil won't splatter if I lower the heat, right?」

％Ｂ
「It won't taste good if you don't use high heat. You won't heat everything all the way through.」

Touko
「Mmmhh...! You're having fun watching me suffer
, Ryousuke-kun

. I just know you are!」

...What's sulking gonna do for you?
Though I did think she looked cute getting all frantic.

％Ｂ
「No, I'm not. Come on, that's gonna burn if you're not careful.」
Touko
「Huh? Aagh! No, no! It was going so well until now!」

She's panicking.
She seems to be more nervous about using the stove than using the kitchen knife.
％Ｂ
「Haha, calm down. It's not gonna burn that quickly.」

Touko
「You're the one who said it was going to burn
, Ryousuke-kun

! Oh, see!? The meat's turned a bit black!」

％Ｂ
「That's normal. Move the pan back and forth and stir while you do so.」

Touko
「Mm, okay...! Hup... Hey... This is kinda heavy... It's... a lot of work...!」

％Ｂ
「I bet. It's enough for two people. Though it could still be heavier, since this is mostly vegetables.」

Touko
「Whaaat...!? Nnnh... Th-This is hard...! It's hard... to shake the pan...!」

...The vegetables are just falling out, you know.
Maybe I shouldn't have had her do this without any practice...?
Touko
「Hahh... I'm tired...! This is going to make just my left arm big! Isn't there an easier way to do it?」


％Ｂ
「There's apparently ways to do it using a microwave, but we're making stir-"fry." You can't fry without actual heat.」

Touko
「Mmm... Then I want a lighter pan. I can't do this unless it's at least half as heavy as this one.」

Gh... She's blaming the equipment even though she's a beginner...!
Lighter pans are expensive, you know!
Touko
「It'd be nice if I could hold the pan with my right hand, but then I can't use the chopsticks... Aaagh geez, this is so inconvenient...!」

％Ｂ
「You won't mind it once you get used to it. The only way to get around this stuff is to practice it over and over.」

Touko
「I think they should really make some more advances... Like they could use scientific techniques to make this all automatic.」

What are you even talking about? You're terrible with technology.
I can't imagine anything other than you getting frustrated because you have no idea how to use the machines.
％Ｂ
「Either way, you should think about shortcuts only after you've gotten the fundamentals down. The fundamentals are important.」

Touko
「...Okaaay. Getting good at cooking's tough...」
Touko
「Dooone! Look, I did it! I'm a genius!」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, this is great for your first time. I think you did a good job.」

Touko
「Ehehe, right? I'm pretty good at cooking after today, right?」

％Ｂ
「Yeah. I think a good analogy would be... like you progressed from a newborn to a toddler?」

Touko
「Whaaat? I think I've made a bit more progress than that. Be more honest about complimenting me!」

I just can't stop myself from spoiling her when I compliment her, though...
It's hard to fix bad cooking habits once you have them, so I want to teach her properly.

all
％Ｂ
「All right, let's try eating it, then.」
I tried to taste-test it earlier, but she stopped me with a "You can't eat it yet!"
Which means I have no idea how it actually came out.
Touko
「...How is it?」
She stares intently at me as I eat the vegetable stir-fry.
Mmmh... There are some parts that are slightly undercooked.
I think there's a bit too much pepper added in too.
Should I... be honest about my feedback?
Start by praising her.
Just be honest.
Touko's the type who does best when she's being praised, like she herself said earlier.
I probably shouldn't be too harsh on her.
％Ｂ
「Yeah, I think it came out pretty good. Look how much rice is gone already.」
Touko
「Really!? Yay! I knew I could do it if I tried!」

She smiles radiantly.
I'm sure she'd be happier about success than failure, which'll help build her confidence.
I should probably give her positive feedback for the sake of her getting better in the future.
％Ｂ
「But it's not perfect, all right? Let's see... If I had to say, I think it could've been cooked a little more evenly, and you might want to ease back on the salt and pepper.」


Touko
「Hmhmh, I see. I'll keep that in mind for next time, then.」

Looks like I've managed to get her motivated to improve herself.
I'm happy to see her get more and more motivated like this.
％Ｂ
「It was pretty fun once you tried it, right?」
Touko
「Mmm... I think it'd be hard to do every day, but it might be fun every once in a while. And I get to eat something tasty after putting in work.」


％Ｂ
「Though thinking of what to cook's harder than actually cooking it.」
Touko
「Oh, I see. Normally you'd have to think about what you're going to make in the first place. That might be hard.」

％Ｂ
「That's why I want you to cooperate with me for lunchbox menus. Now you get why I say "Anything's fine" is the worst possible answer, right?」

Touko
「Okaaay. I'll eat too, then. Let's dig in!」

Touko eats some of the stir-fry.
She chews it slowly, and smiles in embarrassment.
Touko
「Mmm... You're right, it might be a bit too salty. But it tastes good because of all the effort I put in!」

％Ｂ
「Yeah. I think it tastes better 'cause you made this for me too.」

I take another bite.
I think it'll be smiles all throughout dinner today.
Touko
「You like carrots, right? You can have lots of those. I'll just make up for the carrots I won't eat with meat.」

％Ｂ
「Wha, wait a second! I want meat too, you know!」

Touko
「That's your punishment for buying bell peppeeers. I'll add on some cabbage as a limited-time offer.」

％Ｂ
「Stop finding excuses to not eat the vegetables! They're good when you eat them with the meat!」

Touko
「But I wanna fill up on just meat. Here, I'll start dividing it all up.」

She snatches away more and more meat while at the same time piling up vegetables onto my plate.\n\r

I'm not gonna take this lying down!
％Ｂ
「...You haven't realized? I mixed those bell peppers into the meat.」

Touko
「Wha, no way!?」
Touko's chopsticks freeze.
Now's my chance! I'm taking the rest of the meat!
Touko
「Ahhh! That's not fair! You lied to me!」
％Ｂ
「Call it strategy! And it's your fault for trying to take all the meat! Eat your freakin' vegetables!」

...I feel like we might be a bit too rowdy.
I shouldn't lie to her if I'm trying to teach her.
Giving honest and constructive feedback is also a kindness.
％Ｂ
「You should cook it a little more thoroughly. And you should also ease back a little more on the salt and pepper.」

Touko
「...Oh, okay... Did... Did I screw up...?」
Ack! She's clearly depressed...!
I need to do something to fix this...!
％Ｂ
「No, I personally like it strong! I was just talking in terms of a general kinda perspective, or like, less sodium 'cause it's healthier...!」


Touko
「...Really?」
％Ｂ
「Seriously! And it's a bit undercooked, but that's still better than burnt! I think the kinda crunchy feel you get from the carrots'd be a big hit with people who love raw vegetables!」


I start shoveling the stir-fry into my mouth.
It's not like it's inedible, and I'm hungry, so it's actually not that hard to eat it.

Touko
「You don't have to force yourself to eat it. Cooking's hard after all.」
％Ｂ
「Stir-fry's pretty much gonna come out the same no matter who makes it. Though I'm way happier eating this just 'cause you're the one who made it.」


Touko
「...Mm. I'll try some too.」
She takes a bite.
She chews it slowly, and then smiles sympathetically.
Touko
「...Ahaha, you're right. I guess it's not something you can get better at all at once.」

％Ｂ
「It's great for your first time. I burnt this to a crisp the first time I tried making it.」

Touko
「Really? But your lunches are so good.」
％Ｂ
「Everyone's like that at first. Here, I've got a photo as proof.」
I pull up a photo I have saved on my phone.
It's a mass of what's supposed to have been stir-fry that I tried making for the first time. Half of it's pretty much just ash.

Didn't think it'd come in handy like this... I'm glad I decided to save this photo as a keepsake.
Touko
「Agh, this isn't really edible... I wouldn't wanna eat it even if my stomach were empty.」

％Ｂ
「Right? Look how different your first try is. You've got more talent for this than I do.」

Touko
「...Ehehe, you think so?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, I do. It'd be great if you kept getting better so you could make me tasty food in the future.」

Touko
「Ahaha... Mm, I'll do my best. Since I'm having you teach me.」

Thank god. Looks like I was able to salvage things before she lost the will to try again.
I should be a little more careful about my feedback from now on.
Touko
「Here, I'll divide it up. I'm going to eat meeeat.」
％Ｂ
「...Sure, but... Is it just me, or does my plate not have that much meat?」
She tosses cabbage and carrots onto my plate.
Meanwhile, there's a mounting pile of meat on hers.
％Ｂ
「That's not stir-fry, that's just grilled meat. Eat the vegetables too.」

Touko
「But the meat's tastier. Wouldn't it be a waste if I got full on just vegetables?」

％Ｂ
「...Let's keep a balanced diet in mind.」
all
The wind and rain are getting stronger, just like the forecast said it would.
There's thunder too... I bet it's only going to pick up starting now.

％Ｂ
「Touko, you sure you don't need to start heading home? The weather's only gonna get worse from here on out.」

Touko
「Mmm? It's fine. I'm planning on staying the night.」
％Ｂ
「Wha...? Again?」
Touko
「Because I'd feel safer with you than by myself in case something happened.」



I'm happy she's staying, but is that really okay...?
Her parents aren't going to be like, "We got worried and came home only to find our daughter was missing!", right?

Touko
「More importantly, what should we do now? We need to think of what we can do in here, since we can't go outside.」


％Ｂ
「Wanna just watch a DVD or something? Let's see, do I have any good movies or anything...?」
Touko
「Mmm... I think just sitting still might make me sleepy. Is there anything else we could do?」

Hmm, so she asks, but...
I didn't think she'd be staying the night, so I didn't really have anything planned...

Touko
「...」
I give a start at her passionate, expectant gaze.
Touko doesn't have to tell me what she wants for me to understand.
We haven't really had the opportunity to do anything more than just touch each other since we've been so busy recently.

Isn't this the perfect chance...?
We were rushing when we did it in the old school building because we were worried about getting caught, so we weren't really able to fully enjoy it.

I... want to make love to Touko more slowly and thoroughly.
％Ｂ
「L-Let's take baths first, then! I'll go first!」

Touko
「Oh, okay... I'll be waiting in your room, then.」
We're both expecting things from each other.
We're alone together, with no one around to get in our way.
...I should be a bit more thorough with washing myself.
％Ｂ
「Thanks for waiting. You can take a bath now... What's wrong?」
Touko
「Mmm... I was just thinking about how you're missing a lot of things in this room. You don't have a comb or hairpins, and the hair dryer isn't really that great.」

％Ｂ
「What do you expect from a guy living alone...? You really think I'd own hairpins or a high-end hair dryer?」

Touko
「Yeaaah, you're right. I need to bring my own next time. I'll go take a bath, then.」

all
I should probably have about an hour or so to myself.
I need to take this opportunity to calm down a little.
I don't want her to think of me as a nervous guy. That'd be uncool.
I desperately calm down my excited heart, and check how many condoms I have.

％Ｂ
「Crap, now that I think about it, we should've just taken a bath together...!」

I've missed out on a great opportunity...!
We had to stop short last time because we got dizzy!
Dammit! That's actually really disappointing!
Touko
「...Thanks for waiting.」
％Ｂ
「Y-Yeah...」
I jump when I see her.
I wonder why girls look so sexy right after they get out of the bath.

Touko
「Um... The wind's really strong, isn't it?」
％Ｂ
「Y-Yeah, it is. It's apparently about time for the hurricane to pass through the area.」
Touko
「Aren't nights with storms kinda exciting?」
％Ｂ
「Huh?」
Touko
「I don't mean like I look forward to them. They're just different from everyday life. I get so excited I can't sleep.」

She gently presses herself against me.
I know we used the same shampoo and body soap... but a ridiculously nice smell's tickling my nostrils right now.

Touko
「...Nights are long, aren't they? I feel like... they've started to feel even longer now that I'm with you
, Ryousuke-kun

.」

％Ｂ
「...You sure tonight's not gonna feel short? Imagine if we end up not having enough time.」
Touko
「Mmm... Well there's still tomorrow, right? We don't have to go to school today or tomorrow, and we'll be together the whooole time.」

We invite each other without directly referring to what we want to do.
It's a bit of an endurance contest, to see who can hold out for longer.
％Ｂ
「...」
Touko
「...」
But there's no way I could stop myself.
It feels stupid to hold myself back when I don't even need to.
％Ｂ
「Touko, I...!」
...Wha?
Touko
「...A blackout?」
Dammit! It was such a good mood...!
That was one hell of a killjoy!
Touko
「Wah, it's pitch black. Where do you have your lights? It's always good to have them ready for when you need them.」

％Ｂ
「Crap, I forgot to get the flashlights and stuff out beforehand! Where were they again...!?」

Touko
「What!? Wait, where are you going!?」
％Ｂ
「Owww!? I banged my shin against the desk!」
I'm pretty sure I saw it somewhere when I moved in...!
I can't do anything about a natural disaster. I should just hurry up and find a flashlight...

The hurricane's blown away that sweet atmosphere from earlier.\n \n\r
It doesn't look like the electricity's coming back on anytime soon, so we just decide to go to sleep for the night.

Touko
「Being here always relaxes me the most. Especially since I can smell lots of good smells this way.」

％Ｂ
「...That makes me super curious. Do I smell that much?」

Touko
「Mhm. Like soap... and like something that's just a bit sweet. Your smell

, Ryousuke-kun

.」
...I kinda don't like the idea of smelling sweet, as a guy.
Is it 'cause I've been eating tons of crêpes with Touko lately?
Touko
「Let's work hard starting in the morning tomorrow. I have to show the results of my training today.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. The hurricane will probably have passed by then, and I'm sure the electricity will be back too.」

Touko
「Fuaaah...nh. Okay then, good niiight.」
She curls up in my arms.
She... really looks like a cat this way.
The hurricane outside might be rattling the windows... but Touko's breathing and warmth grant me peace of mind.

...I feel like I'll have good dreams tonight.
