「And so, we believe the naturalist club is now well on its way to completing its display.」

The event committee's having a meeting today.
Shinozaki and I are giving a progress report.
％Ｂ
「We will continue to support the naturalist club, of course, but we would now like to redirect our efforts toward the astronomy club.」

Shuuichi
「The astronomy club's going to need the photos for its display too pretty soon. You gonna be okay, Segawa?」

Natsuki
「Leave it to me! I'll take some amazing shots!」
all
Marika
「Segawa-san's in a really good mood today. I wonder if something good happened over the weekend.」
％Ｂ
「...No clue...」
all
Maybe it's from our kiss yesterday...
Shuuichi
「You're fine taking the photos right away the week after next, right?」
％Ｂ
「Uh... The week after next? Why so late? We can just get them this week since there's no time, right? It's still Monday.」


Shuuichi
「What? The heck are you talking about?」
％Ｂ
「What do you mean...?」
Marika
「Oh, right. 
Hino-kun, you 
You 
don't know because you transferred...」
％Ｂ
「Wha, don't know...? Don't know what?」
Shuuichi
「We have final exams next week.」
％Ｂ
「Final exams... Excuse me, what might those be...?」
Shuuichi
「Don't play dumb. There's no way you didn't have them at your last school.」
％Ｂ
「You're kidding... I can't believe you have finals here too...」
Shuuichi
「Uh, I personally want to know why you thought we wouldn't have them...」
Marika
「By the way, club and committee activities are canceled before exams. So today's meeting is going to be the last thing we do before exams.」

％Ｂ
「Really... Still, it's really nice of the school to give us a whole week to study.」

Shuuichi
「Uhh... I'll tell you this because it seems like you don't really get it. If you fail finals at our school, you have to take supplementary lessons over the summer.」

％Ｂ
「What? ...Supplementary lessons?」
Shuuichi
「You have to prioritize supplementary lessons, barring a major conflict. So you have to go to those instead of normal club activities or committee work. Students taking supplementary lessons pretty much can't do anything.」


Shuuichi
「...Which means if you end up having to take them, you won't be able to help with Tanabata Festival preparations.」

％Ｂ
「That's... bad, isn't it?」
Shuuichi
「Yeah, pretty bad. So? Still think the school's nice?」
％Ｂ
「...This is the worst school ever.」
Marika
「B-But we have the week to study so that doesn't happen. They want us to put club activities and committee work on hold and study properly.」


％Ｂ
「A week, huh... They should give us more time... This school's so stingy.」
Shuuichi
「You're saying the opposite of what you were saying earlier...」
Shuuichi
「Things really start up for the event committee after exams. Having supplementary lessons just when we're getting busy is inexcusable! I want everyone to know that any idiots who fail will be given a fitting punishment!」


％Ｂ
「A fitting punishment, as in...?」
Shuuichi
「I remember last year there was an upperclassman who had to clean up all the garbage after the Tanabata Festival by himself after he had to take supplementary lessons.」

％Ｂ
「You're kidding...」
I definitely can't afford to fail, then...
all
％Ｂ
「Ughh... I've gotta start studying tomorrow.」
Marika
「Oh... Now that I think about it, isn't there going to be material on the exams from back before you transferred in?」




Shuuichi
「Yeah, I bet.」
％Ｂ
「Wait a second. So what you're saying is... there's gonna be stuff I haven't learned on the exams?」
Marika
「That might be the case...」
％Ｂ
「Wait, wait, wait... You've gotta be kidding me. So it's terrible for me if I fail, and there's gonna be material I don't know? Why are the odds so stacked against me?」


Shuuichi
「It might be stuff you learned at your old school.」
％Ｂ
「Well yeah, some of it. But the textbooks are different.」
Shuuichi
「Oh yeah, that's checkmate.」
％Ｂ
「You're acting like it doesn't matter to you... Well then what about you?」

all
Shuuichi
「I've got Kaori-san's notes up my sleeve.」
％Ｂ
「Come on, that's not fair. Let me borrow them.」
Shuuichi
「You idiot, I won't be able to study then.」
％Ｂ
「Let me copy them, then.」
Shuuichi
「You're gonna copy all of the notes for all of the subjects? You should just use that time to study instead.」

He has a point...
all
％Ｂ
「Sigh... Maybe I'll have Okihara-senpai help me study...」
Marika
「What are you saying? There's someone who can help you with studying right by your side, isn't there?」

all
％Ｂ
「Right by my side...」
I look at Segawa.
Natsuki
「...M-Me?」
Shuuichi
「Oh yeah, you got full marks on a Japanese history exam before, didn't you, Segawa?」

％Ｂ
「F-Full marks!? Seriously!?」
Natsuki
「Oh, yeah, just once. I'm only good at subjects that need memorization... Ahaha.」

％Ｂ
「Still though, full marks is amazing. I haven't done that since grade school.」

Shuuichi
「Good thing you've got a good home tutor around.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, I feel better about my chances now. You mind if I get you to help me, Segawa?」
Natsuki
「O-Of course not! Y-You, you can leave it to me! I'll teach you everything I know!」

She seems strangely nervous compared to how she was during the meeting, but I think I'll just ignore that for now...
