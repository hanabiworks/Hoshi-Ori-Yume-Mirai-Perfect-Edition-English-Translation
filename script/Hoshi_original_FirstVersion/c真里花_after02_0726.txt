％Ｂ
「Err, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to all of you for making time in your busy schedules for this...」

Marika
「Ahaha... That's so stiff!」
％Ｂ
「I can't help being stiff about it.」
all
Yumi
「Did you make sure to get a few marriage registration forms?」
Marika
「Yep, we went to city hall yesterday. We have spares, so it's fine if we make a few mistakes too.」

She pulls out a sheaf of marriage registration forms neatly tucked away in a folder.

Kouji
「Marika, I'm going to check one last time. Once you press your stamp, there's no going back.」

Marika
「Don't worry, I'm not planning on regretting it. I'll start, then～」

all
She immediately starts writing her way through one of the forms.
I don't sense even the slightest hint of hesitation from her movements.
Just seeing that makes me happy.
Marika
「Press my stamp, and... Okay! Done.」
Marika
「Now then... It's your turn, Ryousuke.」
Marika
「Now then... It's your turn.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah.」
I accept the form.
Gotta make sure I don't make any mistakes.
all
％Ｂ
「Here we go...」
I was able to fit everything neatly into the spaces.
Marika
「Hehe... Perfect.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. Now all I need to do is press my stamp... and...」
I place my seal.
Our names have been placed onto the marriage registration form.
all
％Ｂ
「Now then... My new father-in-law. Could I ask you to be our witness?」

Kouji
「Fine, fine. Look at you two, flirting in front of the parents...」

Marika
「We're not flirting that much, you know～」
％Ｂ
「Y-Yeah... Right?」
Yumi
「Fufu... You two don't even realize it yourselves.」
I-Is that really true?
Marika
「Auh～」
I guess we must've been releasing a lovey-dovey aura without even realizing it...
all
Kouji
「Hmm... I'm not good with these kinds of documents. Bring me my reading glasses.」

Yumi
「Why didn't you just wear them to start with?」
Kouji
「That'd make me look like an old man.」
Yumi
「You're right. You're forever young, after all.」
They're talking amicably.
Actually, these two are pretty lovey-dovey too...
Kouji
「And there we go... Okay, done.」
My father-in-law's signed and stamped the space as a witness.
％Ｂ
「Thank you very much. I'll stop by my parents' house tomorrow and get my father to do the same.」

We need two witnesses, so we've decided to have each of our fathers do it.
Marika
「All that's left after that is to submit it to City Hall.」
Kouji
「Which means that Marika's become a bride now... We're gonna drink all night, then!」

Marika
「D-Don't make me drink too much!」
all
Kouji
「What? What's wrong with a bit of family drinking?」
Yumi
「That's not a good excuse, you know.」
Kouji
「It's fine. Go get us some beer.」
Yumi
「Yes, yes.」
Marika
「I'm sorry about this.」
％Ｂ
「It's all right. I like drinking with him.」
I've become able to think that recently.
all
Eventually, my mother-in-law comes back with beer and glasses in hand.

％Ｂ
「Let's drink together, Father.」
Kouji
「S-Sure...」
Yumi
「I think I'll have some too.」
Marika
「Oh, then me too～ Just a little tiny bit...」
％Ｂ
「Uhh, then... A toast, I guess?」
Marika
「Yeah, let's do it. A toast to our families joining together!」
We clink our glasses together.
Marika's dad instantly drains his glass.
Marika and her mom just take tiny sips.
all
Yumi
「Have you fixed up your new home yet?」
％Ｂ
「No, not at all so far.」
We moved into our new house last weekend.
Marika
「I'll be going on break starting this week, so I guess I can start tidying up then...」

％Ｂ
「I'll get some time off next week too, so we'll be able to manage it before the ceremony.」

all
The ceremony's finally next weekend.
It had been so far off for so long, but it's suddenly so close.
Kouji
「It's still like playing house for now. You need to get it together, to put me at ease sooner.」

Marika
「Huh? Was that encouragement just now? That's rare.」
Kouji
「It-It wasn't encouragement or anything. It's just, well, we live close by. Come around whenever you can.」

Yumi
「It looks like he's lonely because you're going to be gone, Marika.」
Marika
「Whaaat～ ...Really?」
Kouji
「I-I never said that! Children leave the nest someday. Everyone knows that. Absolutely everyone...」


all
He looks away and mutters.
It's enough to let me know just how much he cares about Marika.
％Ｂ
「We'll stop by as much as we can. Right, Marika?」

Marika
「Yeah! We'll come over for sure～」
The four of us drink.
It's a warm place to be.
