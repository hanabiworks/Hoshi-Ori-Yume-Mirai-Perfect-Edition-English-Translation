I'm at the mall to buy some everyday necessities.
％Ｂ
「Tissues, detergent... What else do I need again?」
I have to stay on top of restocking stuff like this, since I'll be living alone for a while still.

％Ｂ
「I'm almost out of shampoo, so I should get some...」
％Ｂ
「...Huh?」
I spot a familiar-looking girl walking in front of me.
％Ｂ
「Ousaka!」
She turns around, and it's just who I thought it was.
％Ｂ
「Yo!」
Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「Fancy seeing you here. Out shopping?」
Sora
「...For books. What about you?


」
％Ｂ
「Me? I'm going to the supermarket to pick up some everyday supplies. Living by myself's a pain 'cause I have to buy all this stuff myself.」


Sora
「...Those are cheaper at the drugstore.」

％Ｂ
「Are they?」
Sora
「...There's a super-cheap drugstore over there. I'll show you.」
％Ｂ
「Wha, you sure? You're going to the bookstore, aren't you?」
Sora
「...I can get books afterward. No issues.」
％Ｂ
「Okay. Yeah, could you show me, then? I still don't really know the stores here that well, since everything's different.」


Sora
「...This way.」
all
％Ｂ
「Man, that place really was cheap!」
The drugstore Ousaka showed me had everything I needed, and it was cheaper than at the supermarket too.

It sold shampoo and conditioner in sets, and stuff like two-liter bottles of tea for 98 yen.

And luckily enough, there just happened to be a limited-time sale on tissues when we got there.

％Ｂ
「That was a good place. Thanks for showing me.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「You're going to the bookstore, right? I'll come with you.」
Sora
「...You sure?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, I might as well. I wanna get a magazine or something to read when I've got time to kill. Come on, let's go.」

Sora
「...*nod*」
all
Ousaka and I bought a book and a magazine respectively, and we were given vouchers for a lottery with our purchases.\n\r

They're apparently doing it in the middle of the street.
％Ｂ
「Five vouchers for one try. How many'd you get?」
Sora
「...Four.」
％Ｂ
「I got two, so I guess that means there's only one try between the two of us... No, wait a second.」
I think I got a few back at the drugstore too.
％Ｂ
「Let's see... One, two, three... I've got four more here, so that makes ten total. All right, we can do one try each now.」

Sora
「...I don't think we'll get anything impressive.」
％Ｂ
「Now don't be that way. Let's try our luck.」
all
We head to where the lottery is. They have the prizes out on display.
％Ｂ
「Let's see, the special prize is... a hot springs vacation!? Look, "Indulge yourself with soothing hot springs under a sky filled to the brim with stars. For one pair"!」

Sora
「...Ooh.」
Her eyes are sparkling.
She must be excited about the "sky filled to the brim with stars" part.
all
The people in front of us spin the lottery wheel.
A white ball pops out.
Lottery Staff
「And heeere's your consolation prize!」
They leave in bitter defeat after being handed a packet of tissues.
％Ｂ
「So the consolation prize is tissues... Yeah, that's pretty normal. Like you said, I doubt we'll get anything too... Wait, what? Ousaka?」

Lottery Staff
「Yes, we're ready for the next person!」
Sora
「...Two spins.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, she's already in line...」
Sora
「...
Ryou, hurry
Hurry
.」
％Ｂ
「R-Right...」
all
She's just raring to go, despite her skepticism earlier...

Lottery Staff
「Oh, a couple. No one's won the special prize hot springs vacation yet, so good luck!」

％Ｂ
「Uh... No, we're not...」
Sora
「...」
Ousaka's gone red.
I'm kinda surprised she has reactions like this...
％Ｂ
「Uhh... Who's gonna go first?」
Sora
「...I'll go first.」
％Ｂ
「All right. Good luck!」
She's so motivated...
Sora
「...Hmh.」
She spins the wheel with gusto.
A blue ball pops out.
Lottery Staff
「Oh, congratulations!」
％Ｂ
「Ohh! That's awesome, Ousaka!」
Sora
「...Mhmh.」
She turns back toward me and gives me the usual smug look and thumbs-up.
Did she seriously win the special prize!?
Lottery Staff
「The blue ball is the fifth-place prize. Three boxes of tissues!」
Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「Well, uh... That's better than just a small packet of tissues... Yeah.」
Her smug look immediately became an incredibly dissatisfied expression.
I get why though.
％Ｂ
「All right, leave the rest to me. I'll get revenge for you.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
all
Lottery Staff
「Now then, Mr. Boyfriend, this is your chance to show off your cool side in front of your girlfriend!」

％Ｂ
「No, we really aren't dating...」
I wish they'd stop... It's kinda messing with me...
％Ｂ
「Phew... All right!」
I pump myself up and grab the handle.
Will Ousaka be happy if I actually win the special prize?

Oh, but... say I do end up winning it. Who's gonna go on the trip...?

I'll have been the one who won it, but Ousaka's the one who wanted it in the first place...
It's for a pair, so...
...So Ousaka and I would go together...?
all
No, but there's no way...
She'd probably go with a family member or something.
No...! But it's Ousaka. Maybe─
「You gave me your voucher, so I'm going with you.」
─I could see her saying something like that...!
No...! But it's Ousaka. Maybe─
「You gave me your voucher, so I'm going with you.」
─I could see her saying something like that...!
all
Lottery Staff
「Excuse me, sir, if you would spin it...」
％Ｂ
「Wha...!? Oh... I'm sorry...」
I psych myself back up again and spin the wheel.
The ball is... yellow!
Lotter Staff
「Ohhh!? It-It's...!」
Sora
「Hgh...!?」
Did I do it!?
Did I pull it off!?
％Ｂ
「...It's... a phone strap.」
I won the fourth-place prize. A phone strap with a glass bead shaped like a star.

％Ｂ
「...Yeah, I guess I shouldn't be surprised.」
Unfortunately, I didn't get the prize she wanted.
Or so I thought, but...
Sora
「...」
Ousaka's been staring at the star strap this whole time, holding the three boxes of tissues she won in her hands.\n\r

Man, she sure loves stars...
％Ｂ
「...Wanna trade?」
Sora
「...?...」
％Ｂ
「You'd rather have this, right?」
Sora
「...You won that
, Ryou

. I won this.」
She holds the boxes of tissues to her chest.
％Ｂ
「Here, then let me be the one to ask. Could you trade those tissues with me, for this strap?」

Sora
「...I need no pity.」
％Ｂ
「No, it's not pity. I came here 'cause I needed everyday stuff anyway. If anything, I want those tissues more than this strap.」


Sora
「...But you already bought five boxes.」
％Ｂ
「...」
She's right. I bought a five-box set of tissues in that limited-time sale at the drug store earlier.

％Ｂ
「But it's not like it's ever a bad thing to have more tissues, right? I was actually feeling kinda worried about only having five.」

％Ｂ
「So come on, please. Trade those tissues with me for this strap.」

Sora
「...～～...」
Oh, look at that. She's conflicted.
Sora
「...If you want to... that badly
, Ryou

...」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, it'd really help.」
I take the tissues from Ousaka and hand her the star strap in exchange.

Sora
「...Ooh...」
She stares at the strap, her eyes alight.
％Ｂ
「You like it?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「I'm glad.」
Sora
「...
Ryou
Mm
...」
％Ｂ
「Hm?」
Sora
「...Thanks...」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. Thanks for the tissues too.」
％Ｂ
「All right... What now? You gonna go home?」
Sora
「...How about you?


」
％Ｂ
「Let's see... It'd kinda be a pain to walk around here with all these tissues... Wanna go eat something?」

Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「Great. Anything you wanna eat?」
Sora
「...Burgers.」
％Ｂ
「We ate burgers just the other day. You hooked?」

Sora
「...*nod* It was good.」
％Ｂ
「Really. All right, let's get burgers, then!」
The burger place was as crowded as ever, and there weren't any open seats.

We got our food to go like last time, and started heading toward a side path without many people.

I feel like we might accidentally make some kind of "burgers = eat while you walk" formula in Ousaka's head this way.

Ousaka picked out something from the menu herself this time.
She decided on a double burger.
％Ｂ
「Hamh... ngh, ngh...」
Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「What's up? Not gonna eat?」
Sora
「...I will... Amh...」
She's timidly eating a little bit at a time.
I know why. It's the pickles.
％Ｂ
「Just take the pickles out when you get to them.」
Sora
「...*nod*... Amh... mgmgh... Nh...!」
She stops walking and turns robotically toward me yet again.
Her lips are scrunched shut.
Looks like she's reached the pickles.
％Ｂ
「Found them?」
Sora
「...Mm...」
She holds out her half-eaten burger to me.
There are some pickles sticking out. I can see a small bite mark in them.

Sora
「...Mmm...」
％Ｂ
「Wha?」
She pushes her burger toward me.
％Ｂ
「...You don't want me to eat it, do you?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
She starts moving her burger toward my mouth as I'm hesitating.

％Ｂ
「...Like this?」
Sora
「...*nod nod*...」
It's like with the yakisoba bread. I guess she just doesn't care that much about this kinda stuff...

％Ｂ
「...Then... I'm gonna eat them, okay?」
Sora
「...*nod nod*」
％Ｂ
「Hamh...」
I grab just the pickles with my teeth and pull them out from the burger.
A sweet-and-sour indirect kiss.
％Ｂ
「Crunch crunch... Crunch... There, I ate them.」
Sora
「...Mm...」
She checks to see the pickles are gone, nods in satisfaction, and starts eating again.

And here I am, secretly really nervous...
It was the yakisoba bread before, and now pickles from a burger...
That was my second indirect kiss with Ousaka.
Does she really not think anything of that?
I feel like that kinda makes me sad in a―
Sora
「...Mnh...!!」
％Ｂ
「Hm? What's wrong?」
Sora
「...」
She scrunches her mouth closed again, and looks at me resentfully.\n\r

And then... a small crunch...
％Ｂ
「Oh yeah, it's a double burger, so it's got two burgers' worth of pickles.」

Sora
「...～～～～～」
She plunks her fists on my shoulders in protest.
Ahh... Spending time with her like this is kinda nice.
