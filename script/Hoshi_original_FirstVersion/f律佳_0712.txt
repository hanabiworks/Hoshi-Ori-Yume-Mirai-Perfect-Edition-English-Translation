「...All right.」
I've arrived at our meet-up spot.
Rikka's not here yet.
It just wouldn't be cool of me as a guy to make the girl wait when we're going on a date.
％Ｂ
「How long's it been since the last time I swam in Shionagi's sea?」
I feel like I remember it being a bit colder here than back in Kanagawa.
％Ｂ
「And man, is it hot today...」
The sun smiles down on me from above.
There's sweat beading on my forehead just from me standing here.
Summer's suddenly in full swing after exams.
I can hear one or two cicadas. Their calls seem to amplify the heat.

It's way better than rain, though.
I move into the shade to wait for Rikka.
A few minutes later...
It's decently before the time we agreed on. I spot a girl in a one-piece dress.
Her eyes go wide when she sees me, and she runs over.
％Ｂ
「Morning.」
Rikka
「Good morning. Did I get the time wrong...?」
％Ｂ
「No, I just got here early 'cause I couldn't wait. I should say the same for you, Rikka. There's a lot of time left before when we were supposed to meet up.」


Rikka
「...I... also couldn't wait.」
％Ｂ
「Looks like we're the same, then. Haha!」
Rikka
「Hehe, you're right.」
I can see the necklace I gave her glittering around her neck again as she smiles.

I look down at her hands. She's carrying a wicker basket.
％Ｂ
「Is that...?」
Rikka
「It's lunch. Let's eat it together once we're there.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, that sounds great. Can I take a peek inside?」
Rikka
「Hmm～ ...I won't stop you, but I'd be happy if you could think of it as a nice surprise for lunch.」

％Ｂ
「If you say so. That's just getting me even more excited. Here, I'll hold it.」

Rikka
「Thank you. Hehe, I put a lot of effort into it, so expect good things.」
I take the basket from her.
It's heavier than I expected.
She probably made a lot of stuff.
I'm getting excited for lunch already.
％Ｂ
「Let's get going, then.」
I hold her hand with the hand that isn't occupied with the basket, and we start walking to the bus stop.

％Ｂ
「Ohh～ There are a lot of people here...」
I step outside onto the sand after getting changed. The newly opened beach is bustling with excited visitors.

Speaking of exciting, what's really getting me going... is Rikka in her swimsuit.

Thinking about how I'm gonna get to see that soon is making me go crazy.
％Ｂ
「I wonder what it's gonna be like...」
Rikka's got a nice figure, so I doubt there's anything that would look bad on her.

I can feel the heat of the sun from the white sand beneath me.
The soles of my feet are starting to get hot.
％Ｂ
「Hmm～ ...She's taking a while.」
I feel like it's been a while since I got done changing...

I wonder how long it usually takes for girls to get changed.
Maybe something happened in the changing room?
...I guess I'll go check on her.
I can't go inside, so I step toward the women's changing rooms so I can at least get close.

％Ｂ
「...Hm?」
I feel something tug a bit on the waistband of my swim trunks.
Rikka
「...」
％Ｂ
「...」
Rikka's looking up at me, leaning over as if she's trying to hide herself.

In contrast to her pale skin and white bikini-and-pareo swimsuit, her face is bright red.

I'm lost for words at the sight.
％Ｂ
「Uh... Lots of people in the changing room?」
Rikka
「There weren't that many... Um, you see... I was embarrassed.」
％Ｂ
「Embarrassed?」
Rikka
「～～～! It's my first time wearing a swimsuit with so little fabric...!」

Rikka
「I knew I should've gone with the one I picked instead of Segawa-san's suggestion...」

％Ｂ
「You bought that with Segawa?」
Rikka
「I haven't been to the beach since I was little, so I only have a school swimsuit.」

Rikka
「I wasn't about to come here in a school swimsuit, so I asked Segawa-san to come with me to buy one yesterday.」

％Ｂ
「So the reason you didn't look too enthusiastic about going to the beach was...」
Rikka
「Because I didn't have a swimsuit, and I've never really gone before...」

I see, so this is what she was doing with Segawa yesterday.
I remember Segawa saying something about me on my knees before her in gratitude... Yep.
You've done excellent work, Segawa!!
Rikka
「How are other people okay with so little fabric? ...This is the same as just wearing underwear.」
Rikka
「And... I don't have as big of a chest as Segawa-san and the others...」
She points her gaze downward, looking disheartened.
％Ｂ
「I'd like your chest no matter what it was like.」
Rikka
「...What?」
％Ｂ
「Oh, I don't want you to misunderstand. I didn't mean that in a dirty way, and I'm not trying to sexually harass you or anything.」

％Ｂ
「Your chest wasn't why I wanted to date you.」
％Ｂ
「I like you 'cause you're you, and that part of you's just another thing I like.」

％Ｂ
「So if it's my opinion you're worried about, you don't need to compare yourself with others. I'm not interested in anyone other than you.」

Rikka
「Hehe. That was embarrassing to say, wasn't it?」
％Ｂ
「Just a bit.」
Rikka
「But... I see. If you're okay with it, then I am too. I'm not interested in anyone other than you either.」

Rikka
「You're the only one I want to have see this.」
She smiles brightly.
％Ｂ
「That swimsuit looks really good on you. You said you bought that for today, right? Thanks.」

Rikka
「Ah, uuhh... It's still embarrassing, but I'm happy you like it.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, I do. You're really cute too.」
Rikka
「...Thank you. Ehehe... I'm glad I gave this a try.」
Looks like Rikka's happy too.
Still, the pareo.
She looks incredibly cute in it.
But at the same time, I want to see what's underneath.
％Ｂ
「Rikka, I have a bit of a request...」
Rikka
「What is it?」
％Ｂ
「Would it be okay for you to take off the pareo?」
Rikka
「...! I-I won't...」
％Ｂ
「No matter what?」
Rikka
「This is already enough to make me feel like my face might light on fire. I couldn't possibly go any further.」
％Ｂ
「Hahhh... So it's a no～」
I can't stop my shoulders from slumping.
I know I shouldn't, but I just don't want to give up on it.
Rikka
「...Do you really want to see it that badly?」
％Ｂ
「I do.」
Rikka
「What an immediate answer. Geez, you perv... Don't stare too much, okay?」
She places her fingertips on the knot holding her pareo up.
The pareo rustles as it falls away.
Revealing...
％Ｂ
「Ohh...」
A sight so wonderful I can't stop myself from making a sound.
Rikka
「I told you not to stare...」
％Ｂ
「Whoops, sorry. I couldn't help it. Yeah, you look really good down here too. You're really pretty.」

Rikka
「I-I see...」
She twists in embarrassment as she holds her hands over her crotch.
％Ｂ
「...?」
I sense something and look around.
A bunch of guys are all staring at Rikka. \n \n\r

A few of the guys have girlfriends too.
But I can't really feel smug and superior about this.
I pull Rikka by the hand, away from the other guys.
Rikka
「...What's the matter?」
％Ｂ
「Sorry. I know I was the one who asked you to do that, but I kinda didn't like the idea of other guys looking at you. I'm not that much of a man, am I?」

Rikka
「Oh... N-No, I don't want anyone other than you to look at me either...」
％Ｂ
「Let's go have fun over there.」
Rikka
「Okay. But what are we going to do?」
％Ｂ
「Good question...」
We didn't bring anything like a beach ball or swim rings, so we'd need to rent something at a beach house if we wanted one.

And I don't know if that's how you're supposed to have fun with your girlfriend at a beach either.
％Ｂ
「Swimming's the most obvious choice, but is there anything you wanna do?」
Rikka
「What did you do at the beach when you were young?」
％Ｂ
「I'd race my friends to see who could swim to the buoy first, played beach volleyball... Oh, I played with sand too.」

％Ｂ
「It's different from sandboxes in the park 'cause the sand here absorbs water and hardens better. Plus, there's water right there and there's as much sand as you could possibly want.」

Rikka
「You mean making sand castles...?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, that's it. Digging tunnels and stuff too.」
Rikka
「I think I might want to try that...」
％Ｂ
「Let's make a sand castle, then.」
And so we've decided what to do.
Rikka
「Hey, let's have lunch.」
％Ｂ
「Huh? It's lunchtime already?」
Rikka
「Hehehe. You were really focused.」
％Ｂ
「I kinda couldn't stop once I got going.」
all
The sand castle ended up being a way bigger design than we initially were going to do, and I've only just about finished the foundations.

％Ｂ
「Oh, that looks good.」
Rikka's already laid out the contents of the lunchbox.

I sit on top of the sheet she's prepared.
％Ｂ
「Can I eat?」
Rikka
「You need to wash your hands first. They're covered in sand. Hehe, you're like a child.」
％Ｂ
「Oh... I'll go wash them off in the sea.」
Rikka
「Salt water's just going to make your hands sticky when it dries. Here, use this. I wet this towel under tap water.」

％Ｂ
「My, how very perfectly prepared.」
Rikka
「...」
She pulls the towel away when I try to take it.
％Ｂ
「Rikka?」
Rikka
「You can't eat with your hands dirty, can you?」
％Ｂ
「Nope.」
Rikka
「Well, I don't have a choice then... because you have... to eat.」

Her face is red. She sounds like she's trying to make an excuse for something.
％Ｂ
「...?」
Rikka
「Um, well... What do you want to eat first?」
％Ｂ
「Uh...」
That means she'll feed me... right?
％Ｂ
「The egg sandwich looks good.」
Rikka
「Okay. Here, open your mouth.」
％Ｂ
「Aaahh～」
％Ｂ
「Amh, hamhamh. Mhm, that's great! The egg's real fluffy, and there's just the right amount of salt.」

Rikka
「I'm glad. What do you want next?」
％Ｂ
「Mmm～ I have a request.」
％Ｂ
「I want you to go, "Aaahh～" when you feed me.」
Rikka
「Wha... That's a bit embarrassing... This was already embarrassing enough, but I thought you might like it, so...」

％Ｂ
「Really... That's a shame, but if you don't want to...」
It's already great enough that she's feeding me.
I'd probably end up incurring some kinda divine wrath if I asked for anything more.
％Ｂ
「I want some fried chicken next.」
Rikka
「The fried chicken, okay...」
She grabs some with her chopsticks.
Rikka
「...Here. Say "aaahh～"...」
％Ｂ
「Wha?」
Rikka
「A-Aahhh～～」
％Ｂ
「Ahhh～ Mgmgh. This is great too! Maybe it's 'cause you're feeding me?」

Rikka
「I see... Hehe.」
％Ｂ
「But you know what, I'll wash my hands after all.」
Rikka
「Wha... Did I do something wrong? Is being fed bothersome?」

％Ｂ
「No. To be honest, I wish I could have you feed me the whole time.」
％Ｂ
「But it'd be unfair if it's just me. I wanna feed you too.」

Rikka
「Me? You're going to feed me?」
She must not have expected that.
She looks surprised, but there's also a bashful note of anticipation in her eyes.

I wash my hands off in the sea and wipe the salt off with the wet towel.
％Ｂ
「What do you want first?」
Rikka
「Uh, mh... The fried egg, then.」
％Ｂ
「Roger that. Open up. Say "ahhh～"」
Rikka
「Aahhh～ ...Amh, mgmgh... It's sweet and tasty, hehe.」
She smiles blissfully.
We continue trading off feeding each other, enjoying our lunch to the fullest.
all
％Ｂ
「It's finished!」
We continued making the sand castle after lunch until the sun was about to set.

There's an impressive-looking sand castle before us, about as high as my thighs when I'm crouching.
％Ｂ
「We ended up playing with sand the whole day today, I guess.」
Rikka
「Hehe... You were as excited as a child making this castle. I think I can see why you say you want to be an architect now.」

％Ｂ
「Haha, yeah, maybe this is where it all started.」
It's great to make other people happy, of course.
But I think it also has to be something that I can enjoy working on just as much.

Which is why the thought that it might've all started with something like this makes sense to me.

％Ｂ
「Sorry, though. You probably had other things you wanted to do too.」
Rikka
「I didn't have any qualms about watching you work so hard on this sand castle. And it was fun for me too.」
Rikka
「I've never played with sand before. It's very fun. And besides, we can just come again, can't we?」

％Ｂ
「You're right. We definitely should.」
all
Most of the families have gone home already, leaving just a few couples walking here and there across the sunset-dyed sands.
The beach houses are starting to close down too.
Rikka
「We should get going too.」
％Ｂ
「But there's still one thing we have to add before that.」
Rikka
「Huh?」
％Ｂ
「The tunnel. You gotta dig a tunnel when you make a sand castle. I'll dig on this side, so you do the other.」

The foundation's packed tight, so it shouldn't crumble easily.
I estimate my direction so I'll end up going straight toward Rikka, and start digging.

Rikka
「Hehe, geez...」
all
She smiles in dismay and starts shaving sand away on her side.
We continue digging for a while, totally engrossed...
Rikka
「Oh...」
％Ｂ
「Oh...」
I feel a warm softness, completely different from the cold sand.
I extend my hand, and small fingers wrap themselves around my fingertips.
We hold hands in the newly opened tunnel and smile at each other.
Rikka
「Hehe, it's complete. What number construction is this for you?」
％Ｂ
「It's the first. This is the first thing I've built since I decided to become an architect.」
The models I've made up until now have always just been nothing more than models...
It may be made entirely of sand, without any reinforcing factors... and no one can live in this, but this is for sure a castle that I designed―this castle is mine and Rikka's.


％Ｂ
「I was able to finish it with your help. Thanks.」
I bring my face closer to hers, still holding her hand in the tunnel.
She slowly closes her eyes.
Rikka
「Ah... Mmh, chu. Hafh...」
％Ｂ
「Rikka... I love you.」
Rikka
「Mh, chu... Chmh... ah, fuah... Me too... I love you too...」
Rikka
「Chu, chu... Nh, hamh... ah... mmchu... chu, chuuuh...」

It was only supposed to be a little kiss, but it quickly changes to us pecking at each other's lips.

It's like I can feel Rikka's feelings and happiness through where we touch.

We kiss over and over.
No matter how many times we kiss, it won't be enough... Thoughts like that fill my heart.
Rikka
「Ah, nh... Chu, chuh... Chuh, chmh... Hahh, fh... nh, chu, chuph... chu!」
Rikka
「Chuph... Chu, chu, chu... Hah, ah...fh... I love you... I love you so much... Nh, chu, chu.」

Rikka
「Chu... Afh... Chu, mmchu... Chu, chu, chu... Chuuh... Oh.」

％Ｂ
「Looks like the sand castle crumbled, huh.」
Rikka
「We must have gotten closer without realizing. I didn't notice.」
％Ｂ
「Too focused on kissing?」
Rikka
「Uuuh... It's the same for you, isn't it?」
％Ｂ
「I cannot deny that. So...」
Rikka
「Mhm... Give me lots more.」
She smiles and pulls herself even closer.
We hold each other on top of the ruins of the sand castle.
Rikka
「Mm... chu... Chuh... Chu, mmchu... Chhhmh, chu, chuuuh...」

A deeper kiss than before... I trace my tongue across her teeth and tangle it around her tongue.
Rikka
「Afh... chuh... lrh... mlh... Nh, chu... Mmlh... pchu, chu... nnchu.」

Rikka
「Mmchu... chuph... Mlh... Chu, chuuuh... Chu, chu... Hafh, chu, chuh... Chuph... Ah, fh...」
Rikka
「Kisses are nice... I can really feel how much we love each other...」

Rikka
「...Chu... Chu, chuh... Amh, mlh, slrp... Chu, pchu... Chuph...」

Rikka
「Chuh, chu, chuh... Hah, ah... Nh, chuh... amh... Chuh... slrp... afh, mlh... Chuph... ah, nh...」

I slowly pull Rikka away from me as she starts getting more aggressive with her tongue.

Rikka
「...Why?」
Her moist eyes look at me worriedly.
％Ｂ
「I don't think I'll be able to stop myself if we go any further.」
My member's already completely up and at attention under my swim trunks.
Rikka makes a small sound and her face flushes... She must have noticed.

％Ｂ
「I want it to happen one day, but that's not something I can decide on my own, right?」
％Ｂ
「I'm sure you need to mentally prepare, and your feelings are important to me. So once you think it's okay to do things like that with me―」
Rikka
「Hehe... Thank you. But you see...」
Rikka
「Mmh, chu... Hahh. Your words, your attitude, your kisses... Everything you do lets me know how much you care about me.」


Rikka
「That's why... I want it to be you
, Ryousuke

. I want you
, Ryousuke

.」
％Ｂ
「Oh...」
％Ｂ
「Wanna... come over tomorrow?」
Rikka
「...」
Rikka
「Mhm... I do... Please take good care of me.」
