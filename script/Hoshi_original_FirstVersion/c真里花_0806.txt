％Ｂ
「I-I'm done...」
I make the final pinhole. I'm finally finished with my share.

％Ｂ
「How about you, Ousaka?」
Sora
「...Same here.」
Looks like we finished at pretty much the same time.
Ousaka's eyelids are drooping. She looks like she might fall asleep at any moment.
I bet I look the same way.
The two of us haven't slept much at all these past few days, so it's to be expected.

all
Natsuki
「Nnnghh... Stars in my eyesss...」
Misa
「Pisces is swimming...」
And that goes for everyone. They're all lying on the ground like corpses.\n\r

It's just a pile of the dead.
all
Marika
「Fnyaaahh... auh... I-I fell asleep～! What about the planetarium...!?」

That's the first thing on Marika's mind once she springs awake.
％Ｂ
「All that's left is to put it together.」
The parts are all complete.
All we need to do now is attach the twelve sides together.
Marika
「Phew... Thank god... That's great!」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. Looks like we'll be able to pull this off.」
all
Sora
「...But there's only ten.」
Ousaka counts the number of parts we have.
all
％Ｂ
「Don't worry. I'm sure he'll pull through...」
That's when I hear light footsteps.
They're coming from behind the classroom door.
％Ｂ
「...Here he is.」
...But were his footsteps always this cutesy-sounding?
Kaori
「Thanks for waitiiing!」
％Ｂ
「...!?」
Sora
「...Who?」
It's a woman with thick, flashy makeup, her legs emerging gaudily from her miniskirt.

％Ｂ
「...Kaori-san? Why are you here?」

It's Shuuichi's girlfriend. Kaori-san.
Kaori
「Here you go!」
She holds out two pentagonal sheets of plastic.
They're filled with pinholes.
Shuuichi
「Sorry for the wait, everyone.」
The person in question appears.
％Ｂ
「...You look pretty refreshed.」
Shuuichi
「We've slept about the same amount. But... I've got a special someone to give me strength.」

Kaori
「Aw, geez, Shuuichi!」
Shuuichi
「Kaori-san helped me in my time of need. You could consider those two pieces to be the product of our loving teamwork.」

Shuuichi
「We put in our own special constellation to celebrate too.」
％Ｂ
「What!? You added stars!?」
Shuuichi
「A heart-shaped constellation, glittering in the night sky... That's the eternal proof of the love between Kaori and me.」

Kaori
「Oh, geez! You're so romantic!!」
Shuuichi
「Now then, Kaori-san. Let's go. Let's take our time and enjoy the Tanabata Festival today.」

They tightly link arms and jauntily walk away.

％Ｂ
「...」
I take another good look at the pieces.
They're pretty much how we need them to be, but there's a huge heart mark in the center...
Sora
「...I'll cover it with black tape. There are no stars like these.」

Ousaka wrests the pieces from my hands and immediately erases the stars of love.
Those sure were short-lived.
all
And so, the Tanabata Festival finally begins.
Natsuki
「We're doing a stargazing aquarium! You there, yes you! There are fresh fish and pretty stars waiting for you! C'mon, just give it a try and see!」



Touko
「Okaaay, don't be shy, come on in. Don't go any further than the colored cones, okay? We're not responsible if the floor falls out under you.」


all
Marika
「Welcome! The stargazing aquarium is this way～ Please be careful, as the path is only dimly lit.」

Our stargazing aquarium's a roaring success.
There's been a constant stream of guests pushing their way through ever since the start of the festival.
Rikka
「Please move clockwise through the path. A narration will begin in five minutes, so please read through your pamphlets and relax while you wait.」


all
And the moment anyone steps foot into this space, they're immediately intoxicated by the phantasmagorical atmosphere.

Shuuichi
「Whoaaah... This is incredible...」
Kaori
「It really is... It's wonderful～」
Shuuichi and Kaori-san stopped by to see how it was going. They've got their necks craned up at the ceiling, lost for words.

％Ｂ
「So you came.」
Shuuichi
「Yeah. Looks like you're doing great. And we wanted to see our work, too. But still...」


He looks around at the room again.
Shuuichi
「This is incredible. Great work, Ryousuke.」

Shuuichi
「This is incredible. Great work.」

％Ｂ
「It's thanks to all of us... Including you, Shuuichi.」

It isn't flattery.
Shuuichi
「Of course it is... So where's Kaori-san's and my stars of love?」

％Ｂ
「Huh? U-Uhh...」
％Ｂ
「O-Over there... I think? It's a bit hard to tell, but...」

Shuuichi
「You're right, that might look like a heart after all! Please look, Kaori-san! Our eternal love glimmers in the sky!」


Kaori
「Oh no... I think I might cry...」
％Ｂ
「H-Hahaha... Good for you guys...」
all
...Let's not say anything about what really happened.
It's the most I can do to atone.
Azuma
「Hoh, now this is really something.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, Teacher!」
Azuma-sensei and the staff from the architectural firm come in after Shuuichi leaves.

％Ｂ
「So you really came?」
Azuma
「Of course I did. I was curious.」
Firm Staff A
「Oh, there's that path of light!」
Azuma
「Hm. You made it by projecting stars onto the ground too. You've got the light shining onto just the paths, making this area feel like the ocean.」


％Ｂ
「I adapted all of your ideas. We'd end up overrepresenting the stargazing angle if the ground was entirely stars. This display's supposed to be "a fusion of sea and sky."」


Azuma
「It's quite well done. You've done well.」
％Ｂ
「Thank you very much!」
It makes me so happy that the Mr. Azuma I respect so much praised me.
I'm glad I didn't make any compromises.
Azuma
「I'll be taking my time here today.」
％Ｂ
「Okay. There will be a narration starting up in just a bit too.」

all
I say my goodbyes and watch them advance down the path.
Marika
「Great for you～」
％Ｂ
「Thanks. This is all thanks to everyone's hard work. I'll let them know that he praised it afterward. It's amazing!」


Marika
「Hehehe... Your eyes are wet, you know. Are you getting a little emotional?」

％Ｂ
「A-Am I? No, this is just 'cause I haven't slept...」

I wipe the tears from my eyes.
Marika
「Huh? Is that...?」
all
Yumi
「Oh, my. It's so pretty! Here, dear. Look at this!」

Kouji
「H-Hm...」
Marika
「Mom, Dad! You came～」

％Ｂ
「Hello. Thank you very much for coming.」
all
Kouji
「I didn't come for your sake. I came to see what Marika made.」

％Ｂ
「Y-Yes, I know...」
Yumi
「Now, now, dear. You'll ruin the mood if you're that grumpy. All of Marika's hard work will go to waste.」


Kouji
「I-I wasn't trying to do that, but...」
Marika
「Yeah, you should have fun while you're here. Oh, look, the narration's starting.」

all
The music that Narusawa picked out starts playing as BGM.
Okihara-senpai's narration begins.
Misa
「Welcome to a world of stars and sea. This world is enveloped in the light of the stars, and the lapping of the waves...」

Misa
「Don't you think the ocean and space are quite similar? They are both worlds we humans cannot easily approach, due to the lack of air.」


Misa
「And it is because they are so unapproachable that they are overflowing with allure and mystery. Let us see these worlds, overflowing with that allure, together.」


Everyone here's entranced listening to Okihara-senpai's gentle narration.\n\r

It's incredibly comforting, combined with the atmosphere here.
People keep showing up after hearing about it. The line's so long that it's extending out the classroom.

Marika
「...This is amazing～」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. It really is.」
To think that all these people would come see... Just thinking about it's filling me up inside.

all
But the display's only just begun.
We need to work hard to see this through safely until the end, so as many people as possible can enjoy this.

Misa
「First, I would like to take you on a journey to the secrets of the deep sea. In the depths of the ocean are...」

％Ｂ
「Phew.」
I step outside.
We're all trading off taking breaks now that the narration's done and it's free time for viewing.

Mother
「I didn't think it'd be that incredible～ I wish your father could have seen this too.」

My mom came all the way to Shionagi just to see our work, and she's tearing up.
％Ｂ
「It's not that big a deal.」
But it definitely doesn't feel bad to hear her say that.
Yumi
「It really was well made. I can't really believe that our children made it.」

Mother
「It was good enough that you could charge money for it. Why don't you actually take about 500 yen per customer? I think you'd make a lot of money with this many people.」


％Ｂ
「Don't talk about money...」
Yumi
「Money's important, you know, Ryousuke-kun. You'll need to keep money in mind if you want to make sure Marika's happy.」


Yumi
「Money's important, you know. You'll need to keep money in mind if you want to make sure Marika's happy.」


％Ｂ
「Huh? Wha, um... Money?」
Marika
「Stop it, Mom～ Don't say things like that! I don't really care about money...」

Kouji
「No! I won't allow it! I'm not giving my daughter to a man who can't even make a decent living!」

Marika
「What are you saying, Dad!?」
Mother
「That's right. My son doesn't have the guts to be a NEET.」

％Ｂ
「...What kinda guts does it take to be a NEET?」
Marika
「That's right! He will not be a NEET! And even if he does end up unemployed... Then I'll be the one to feed him!」

％Ｂ
「What? No, I don't think that's what we're talking about...」
all
Kouji
「I... will nooooooott allow iiiit!」
Yumi
「Calm down, dear. Ryousuke-kun isn't a NEET. I'm sure he'll make billions.」


Yumi
「Calm down, dear. He isn't a NEET. I'm sure he'll make billions.」


％Ｂ
「Uh, I'm not going to be a soccer player or anything, so I don't know about billions...」

Marika
「Geez, no more talking about money!」
Yumi
「Okay. Anyway, would you like to go see other parts of the festival?」
Mother
「Oh, that sounds nice. It's just been so long since I've been to a Tanabata Festival.」

Marika
「I'll guide you, then!」
Mother
「Oh, thank you, Marika-chan. You're such a dependable girl.」

Marika
「Oh no, this is nothing...」
all
Kouji
「H-Hey, wait a minute! What am I supposed to do!?」

Yumi
「You can just go walk around too. Let's go then.」

Mother
「Okay then, Ryousuke. See you.」
Mother
「Okay then, see you.」
Marika
「See you later～」
％Ｂ
「Wha, uh...」
all
The women all hurry away, apparently having come to some mutual consensus.

Kouji
「...」
％Ｂ
「...」
Leaving the two men behind.
It's awkward.
So awkward I wanna die.
Kouji
「...Hmph. Fine. I'll just go kill time somewhere.」

Marika's father starts to walk away without so much as glancing at me, as if to escape.

But is that really okay?
I feel like if I just let him leave like this, things'll always be awkward between us.

...Okay!
％Ｂ
「Um, Father!!」
Kouji
「...Who do you think you're calling Father!?」
Wh-Whoa... I've already made him angry...
Guess I shouldn't have said that.
％Ｂ
「I'm sorry... Then, um... Shinozaki-san.」
Feels kinda weird.
But it's not like there's anything else I can call him.
Kouji
「...What?」
％Ｂ
「Y-You can apparently get coffee over there!? That may be for the best if you'd just like to kill time.」

Kouji
「...That so.」
Her father changes direction and starts walking.
I follow after him.
Kouji
「What are you following me for?」
％Ｂ
「No, I was just thinking of taking a break too...」
Kouji
「...That so. Like I care what you do...」
We get coffee at the stand and go to the inner courtyard.
There are seats set out, but it's all young people sitting in them, so I guess he didn't really feel like he belonged.

Kouji
「Phew... It's really busy here, isn't it...」
And so we're drinking our coffee on a bench a little further away.

％Ｂ
「Um...」
Kouji
「What.」
％Ｂ
「I like Marika-san.」
Kouji
「Bfffffhhh!」
I just up and say it.
He coughs and spits out his coffee.
％Ｂ
「A-Are you okay? Um, here, a towel... Oh, but this is the one I've been using since yesterday...」

Kouji
「Why would I want that!?」
％Ｂ
「R-Right... I'm very sorry...」
Kouji
「Hmmh...」
He just wipes his mouth and sits down on the bench with a thud.

Kouji
「So... what about it?」
％Ｂ
「...These feelings won't change.」
％Ｂ
「I'll always like Marika-san. Now and forever.」

Kouji
「S-So you say. You act like you know what you're talking about, even though you're a child. Things may be going well now, but I'm sure it'll take a wrong turn soon enough...」


％Ｂ
「My feelings will not change.」
Kouji
「That's what they all say. But once they graduate and get out into the real world, they'll...」

％Ｂ
「But I will still continue to like Marika-san.」
Kouji
「Uh...」
％Ｂ
「I'm not asking you to approve of me right away. But perhaps, could you... watch over me, to see if I'm a man worthy of being with Marika-san?」


I look right into his eyes.
Kouji
「H-Hmph... Talk is cheap.」
Kouji
「Well, you know, uh... I'll have you show me with your actions.」

％Ｂ
「Oh...」
That means he'll watch over us... right?

％Ｂ
「Th-Thank you very much!!」
I can't help but yell.
Kouji
「D-Don't shout! And it's not like I've approved of you!」

Kouji
「Honestly... Slurp... Hott... Hoooott...!?」
He drains his coffee in one gulp as if to end the conversation.
He starts walking away, but stops.
Kouji
「...But, well... That stargazing aquarium of yours was impressive. I'll acknowledge that.」


He then hurriedly leaves.

％Ｂ
「...So that means he's approved of me at least a bit, right?」
Joy fills my heart.
％Ｂ
「All right! Let's get back!」
The stargazing aquarium isn't over yet.
I'm gonna work hard until the end, and get lots, lots more people to enjoy it!

The day's events all end, and it's time for the nighttime festival.
Shuuichi
「Err, we now have the results from the attendee surveys.」
Shuuichi's up on a stage with a microphone, holding up a piece of paper.

all
％Ｂ
「There was a survey?」
Marika
「You can vote for the display you liked most. I made sure to vote for the stargazing aquarium.」

％Ｂ
「Really... I missed putting in a vote.」
all
Shuuichi
「After totalling the votes, the first place winner is...」
And then Shuuichi looks at me.
What? No way...
Shuuichi
「The collaborative display between the astronomy and naturalist clubs: the stargazing aquarium!」

all
Cheers resound.
Everyone nearby looks toward us.
％Ｂ
「S-Seriously?」
Marika
「We did it～ That's amazing!」
Shuuichi
「We would like the astronomy and naturalist clubs... as well as the members of the event committee who supported them to please step up onto the stage.」

You've gotta be kidding. That idiot even called me up onto the stage.
Marika
「Wh-What should we do?」
％Ｂ
「No choice but to go. We're all in this together.」

all
Okihara-senpai, Ousaka, and everyone who helped all get on stage under the gaze of the entire student population.

Technically, we have people who aren't in the event committee either here too, but that doesn't matter.
There's no way we could've pulled it off if even one of us weren't here.
Shuuichi
「Err, to commemorate your wonderful display moving the hearts of many of our attendees, we would like to present you with this award.」

He produces a certificate that says "Best Display."
Okihara-senpai accepts it, as the oldest student.
Shuuichi
「It was a splendid display. Congratulations. A round of applause for them～!」



Misa
「Thank you very much. It is an honor.」
Shuuichi
「Now then, if the winners would like to make any comments, they are free to do so!」
all
％Ｂ
「Okihara-senpai, maybe you should speak? This is a good opportunity to advertise the naturalist club. You too for the astronomy club, Ousaka.」



Sora
「...Uuuh.」
Ousaka makes a weird groaning sound, but she still steps up.
Okihara-senpai and Ousaka talk about their club's activities.
Ousaka's speech was pretty disjointed, but they both invited people to join their clubs.

It looks like the stargazing aquarium did a good job of getting people interested. Everyone's listening attentively.

I get the feeling that, judging by our performance today, there'll definitely be some people showing up to become new members of the two clubs.

After the stiff and formal progress speeches and addresses, the nighttime festival kicks off with a karaoke tournament.

Marika
「Everyone's so good～」
％Ｂ
「You think so? There's some really garbage ones.」
all
_00cutinBS
Shuuichi
「Kaori... My looove♪ You were so beautiful, reading books♪ You placed a bookmark in my heaaart♪」


Kaori
「Shuuichi, your song's so wonderful♪」
_00cutinBS
％Ｂ
「I can't believe he'd sing an original love song here... Shuuichi's way off the deep end.」

Marika
「Ahaha, it's really passionate～ Nirasawa-kun must really love his girlfriend.」

all
_00cutinBS
Shuuichi
「～～～ ...Thank you♪」
Kaori
「Kyaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!!」
_00cutinBS
They're a really noisy couple.
I feel a little jealous seeing them be that open about their affection for each other.
Marika
「...I want to sing too.」
She says it quietly, in a voice that clearly isn't joking.
％Ｂ
「Marika... You're gonna go up on stage?」
Marika
「...Oh, n-no one would want to hear me sing, would they?」
％Ｂ
「That's not true. I'd wanna hear you, at the very least.」

Now that I think about it, I've never heard Marika sing.
I wanna see it.
Misa
「I would also like to hear it! You have a very beautiful voice, Marika-san.」

Marika
「Huh? That isn't true...」
Sora
「...Me too.」
Marika
「R-Really～?」
Looks like everyone's all for Marika singing.

Natsuki
「I'll take photos, then! I'll make sure I capture your moment beautifully!」

Marika
「...Okay. Thanks. It might not be good, but I'll go sing loud and clear.」

all
Marika steels herself and heads toward the stage.
She's able to go right away. I guess everyone felt so awkward after Shuuichi's song that they didn't really wanna line up to go next.

Touko
「Good luck, event committee diva!」
Marika
「D-Don't raise their expectations～」
She blushingly takes the microphone.
I think I've heard this song before, before I transferred in. It's a bright, happy pop song.

Marika
「Th-Then... I will sing.」
She breathes in deep. And then starts to sing.

...To be honest, I'm shocked.
I've already heard that she was in a choir before.
But... I didn't think she'd be able to sing this loudly.
We've become lovers, and after being together for so long... there's almost no hint of that fragile child she used to be.


But I think that image of the old Marika still existed inside me.

A thin girl who could never come to school, was always in bed... and always looking forward to getting her printouts.

But that Marika's nowhere to be found now.
She's blushing, but she's standing tall and proud on the stage, under everyone's gaze, boldly gripping the microphone.

She's singing comfortably, smiling bashfully.
She's bright, she's cheery, and always optimistic. That's the Marika before me.

％Ｂ
（...I see.）
I'm happy from the bottom of my heart... I'm completely engrossed in her song.

And I'm proud that this girl is my girlfriend.

I find myself singing along.
And it's not just me. The event committee and the rest of the audience too.
The nighttime festival for Tanabata.
Marika gave it her all more than anyone else.
I'm sure we can all feel that in her singing voice.

Marika's voice swells louder.
She's doing her best to sing loudly, just like she said she would.

Her face is a bit red, probably from nervousness and embarrassment, but she looks like she's enjoying it.

She's trying her best. It's so pure... and so heartwarming.
And that's why everyone's singing along, intoxicated by her singing voice.

Rikka
「...It's a good song.」
Narusawa speaks without being prompted.
She almost never compliments people. But I'm sure everyone's thinking the same thing.

Getting to share this moment makes me so happy―
$$smh_OpenCHK
Marika
「Wah～ ...My heart's still thumping. I was so nervous～」

The nighttime festival came to a close, and Marika and I have come to the old school building.
We're planning on taking our time cleaning things up tomorrow, so everyone already went home...\n\r

But we're just here.
We just don't feel like going home.
It's like we want to stick around and enjoy the festival mood for a bit more.
Marika
「It was so embarrassing...」
％Ｂ
「It was a great song. Everyone was lost in it, not just me. Even Narusawa complimented you, you know.」


Marika
「Really～? That's kind of surprising.」

％Ｂ
「I guess music's all about putting your heart into it, huh?」
Marika
「Yeah. I packed lots of my heart in～」
She shows me an invigorated smile.
She must have really packed lots of her feelings into that song.
Marika
「Hahhh～ ...I think I might've calmed down a little after you said that. Nnnh～～～～ Fuauh.」

She stretches, and then lets a tiny yawn slip.
Marika
「A-Ahahaha... I'm kind of tired all of a sudden.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, me too.. Fuaaah... We haven't slept much these last few days.」

Marika
「Yeah, of course we're tired～ ...Nh, fuaaah...」

She yawns again. Her eyelids are almost completely shut already.
％Ｂ
「You can rest a bit. I'll be watching over you.」

Marika
「Mm, hm... Then, just a bit...」
Marika closes her eyes.
She immediately starts breathing evenly. She must've been really tired.
％Ｂ
「Good work. Man, you look comfortable...」

Just seeing her sleeping face fills my heart.
I want... to see this smile forever...
