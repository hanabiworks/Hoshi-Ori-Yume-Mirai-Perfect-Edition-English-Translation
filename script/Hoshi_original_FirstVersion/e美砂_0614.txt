「I apologize, I didn't know you were already here.」
Shinozaki and I get to the meet-up spot.
Okihara-senpai and Ousaka were already there waiting for us.
Marika
「We're sorry for making you wait!」
Misa
「Oh no, I myself only just arrived. It's just that Ousaka-san appears to have been waiting here for quite some time...」

Sora
「...You're late.」
％Ｂ
「Uh... M-My bad, Ousaka.」
Marika
「Did you wait for a long time?」
Misa
「She apparently has been here since a little past ten o'clock.」
％Ｂ
「Since 10... You were the one who said we were gonna meet up at 11.」

Misa
「I understand how she feels! I believe she may have just ended up arriving early because she was so happy about enjoying the day with everyone.」


Sora
「...」
Looks like Okihara-senpai's right.
She's not affirming or denying it, but she is a bit red.
％Ｂ
「We were planning on getting here a little early... but we had to double back after we realized we forgot the camera.」

Misa
「Isn't that camera Segawa-san's?」
％Ｂ
「Yes. We borrowed her digital camera for today.」
Misa
「So does that mean that Segawa-san will not be joining us today?」
％Ｂ
「She wanted to come too, but...」
Natsuki
「Whaaaat!? You're going to the Maldives this weekend!?」
％Ｂ
「Uhh... No, it's not actually the Mal―」
Natsuki
「I'll come, I'll come! Of course I'll come, are you crazy!?」
Natsuki
「I'll have to buy a swimsuit, then! Where'd I put my passport again? Oh, and I should bring some sunscreen too, right?」


％Ｂ
「No, it's not that we're actually going to the Maldives, she's gonna take us to a place in Japan that's―」

Natsuki
「Ahhhhhh!?」
...What is it now?
Natsuki
「I have to take photos of the soccer club's tournament this weekend...」
Her shoulders slump in despair.
Natsuki
「I'd love to take photos of you jumping around all over the Maldives... but as a member of the grad-alb committee, I have to prioritize my duties...」

％Ｂ
「I'm not gonna be jumping around. And like I said, we're not going to the actual Maldives.」

Natsuki
「What the heck? What's that mean?」
％Ｂ
「Because―」
％Ｂ
「So I explained to her what we were actually going to do, and she handed me this camera and told me to take photos in her stead.」


％Ｂ
「But I'm not used to carrying a camera around with me, so I ended up forgetting it in my room...」

Misa
「And so you had to go back to get it.」
％Ｂ
「I feel like she'd get angry at me if I tried to use my phone camera as a replacement.」
Marika
「She'd probably try to hammer the mindset of a cameraman into you...」
％Ｂ
「And so I'll be the cameraman today as Segawa's proxy. I'll take lots of photos!」

Sora
「...You can't.」
％Ｂ
「You're already putting me down...」
Sora
「...You just can't.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, come on. Yeah, you're right. I'm an amateur when it comes to photography. But, I might have some hidden talent...」

Sora
「...That's not what I mean. You'll see when we get there.」
all
She then starts walking to wherever she's taking us.
We all look at each other and follow after her.
Ousaka's brought us to the Shionagi Science Museum's planetarium, on the corner of the marketplace.

％Ｂ
「I get it... A planetarium.」
Marika
「She's right. I don't think you can use a camera here～」
Misa
「Photography would not be allowed in planetariums.」
all
Sora
「...This is the best place to see what's great about stars.」
％Ｂ
「You're right.」
Ousaka's definitely got a point. The planetarium's probably the best place to find out things about stars.

all
％Ｂ
「Still, I didn't know Shionagi had a planetarium. Was this built after I moved away?」

Marika
「Oh, come on. This was built back when we first started grade school. We went on a field trip right after it opened... Maybe you don't remember?」


％Ｂ
「Ohh... Now that you mention it... I kinda feel like I've been here, but I don't really remember it much.」


Marika
「What about you two?」
all
Sora
「...I come every time the theme changes.」
％Ｂ
「The theme?」

Misa
「They don't always project the same stars. Each exhibit has its own theme, and they apparently change it based on the season or the month.」


Misa
「I've heard that recently they've begun experimenting with various things... playing the works of famous musicians, wafting aromas through the venue, or doing hero shows for the children.」


Misa
「Right, Sora-san?」
Sora
「...Mm.」
Ousaka wordlessly sticks her thumb up.
％Ｂ
「Wow, you're very well informed. Do you come to this planetarium a lot too, Okihara-senpai?」

Misa
「This will be my first time going to Shionagi's planetarium. I've been interested in it for a while now, so I've done some research on their events to prepare for a future visit.」


Misa
「If an aquarium is a place to display fish, then a planetarium is a place to display stars. I have always felt a kinship with them, in that sense.」


Misa
「And so I'm currently very excited! I've been wanting to come here for a very long time!」

％Ｂ
「You seem very happy.」
Marika
「Yes, that's great～」
Misa
「Oh... I apologize, I'm getting all excited on my own...」
％Ｂ
「Oh no, it's fine.」
Still, I'm surprised that Okihara-senpai would get in such a good mood from Ousaka's recommendation.

Though I can understand it a bit, since studying the sea and the stars would both fall into the category of natural sciences.

Sora
「...」
Ousaka isn't reacting that much, but her cheeks are flushed again. She kinda looks a bit happy.

％Ｂ
「Oh...」
The room's lighting is gradually getting darker.
Sora
「...It's starting. Sit down.」
all
Marika
「I think Okihara-san's excitement is starting to rub off on me...」

％Ｂ
「Yeah... Same for me.」
I know I've been here before, but I barely remember any of it.
I'm essentially going to be experiencing this place for the first time.
Misa
「I'm very excited!」

Narration
『...Andromeda, Cassiopeia, Cepheus, and Perseus glitter in the northern heavens... According to legend, these four constellations were known as the four constellations of the Ethiopian royal family.』


Narration
『Today, we will recount the story of these four constellations to you. The love story of Queen Andromeda and the hero Perseus.』


Narration
『It is a tale from long, long ago... In ancient Ethiopia, King Cepheus and Queen Cassiopeia had a beautiful daughter named Andromeda―』

$$smh_OpenCHK
％Ｂ
「Man, that was great!」
Marika
「Yeah! The stars were so pretty～! And the story was so exciting too! That last scene where she kissed Perseus was great～」


To be honest, I didn't think I'd enjoy the planetarium this much.
It was something completely new to me, since I don't remember the last time I came here. It was really moving.
％Ｂ
「That was awesome, Ousaka.」

Sora
「...Mm.」
Marika
「Okihara-san, what did you―」
We look at Okihara-senpai and stop in shock.
all
Misa
「Sniff...」
Marika
「O-Okihara-san?」
She's... She's crying?
Misa
「Oh... I'm very sorry... I was just so moved, I...」
She pulls a handkerchief out from her bag and wipes her tears.
Misa
「It was a very wonderful spectacle.」
％Ｂ
「O-Oh, really...」
I can't believe it affected her so much it made her cry...
I'm a little shocked to see her tears. I've always thought of her as someone that's always bright and cheery.

Misa
「It's as you said, Marika-san. What a wonderful program. The stars were astonishingly beautiful. It was as if there were a real night sky before me. I am deeply moved.」


Misa
「The story was also wonderful. I feel like I may now understand what so many people throughout the ages have seen in the stars above.」

Misa
「I'm so very glad I was able to come here today!」
all
We leave the marketplace.
Marika
「There sure were a lot of couples there～」
％Ｂ
「Yeah... That's a planetarium for you, I guess.」
I bet seeing that as a couple would really set the mood.
Misa
「What does the planetarium have to do with more couples being present?」

％Ｂ
「Uh...?」
I stare back at her on reflex.
She looks genuinely confused.
％Ｂ
「What do you mean? ...It's the same for aquariums too, isn't it?」
Misa
「Now that you mention it, yes. Everyone comes to learn about fish together.」

Misa
「Oh, so you mean to say that planetariums are similar in that lovers come to learn about the stars together?」

％Ｂ
「Uhh...」
Marika
「...Maybe it's Okihara-san's way of making jokes?」
％Ｂ
「No, just look at her face... I think she's serious.」
I've been thinking she's a bit ditzy, but...
Misa
「Is that the correct way of thinking about it, Sora-san?」
Sora
「...Probably.」
Marika
「...Ousaka-san too...」
％Ｂ
「Looks like the two of them gave up an important piece of their humanity in exchange for the passion for the ocean and the stars...」

Marika
「I-I don't... think that's the case～?」
Shinozaki's words sound a little forced.
Sora
「...More importantly, now it's Misa's turn.」
Marika
「Yes, I'm very excited. I'd love to learn about the beauty of the ocean from you next, Okihara-san.」

Misa
「Yes, please allow me! I will now guide you to a planetarium of the sea.」

Marika
「...A planetarium of the sea?」
Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「Huh? I thought we were gonna go to Japan's Maldives...」
Marika
「What? What's that?」
％Ｂ
「Uh, well... Okihara-senpai was talking about it...」
Misa
「Now then, everyone! Let's start by boarding a train!」
Marika
「We can go to Japan's Maldives by train? ...Maybe it's like a hot springs or something?」

％Ｂ
「Hmm, maybe...」
all
Misa
「I promise that all of you will feel wonderful emotions!」

She smiles confidently.
After a two-hour train ride...
We've arrived at a small seaside town far from Shionagi.
The entire town's steeped in the salty smell of the sea.
It's proof that this is a fishing town.
％Ｂ
「So this is Japan's Maldives...」
The ocean's definitely close.
It's true that this ocean would continue out to the Indian Ocean, but...

Marika
「It's nice and quiet here. I kind of like going on little trips like this.」

Sora
「...*nod*」
I'm feeling slightly doubtful, but Shinozaki and Ousaka seem pretty relaxed.

They were happily chowing down on the prepackaged lunches they bought at the station during the train ride too. They're in full-on vacation mode.

％Ｂ
「Okihara-senpai... Is this where you wanted to take us?」
Misa
「Yes. Although to be precise, it would be closer toward the seashore.」
We follow her to the shore.
％Ｂ
「This place sure is peaceful...」
We're standing on a very typical shoreline.
I can see fishing boats moving across the water before us.
％Ｂ
「...So this is a planetarium of the sea?」
Sora
「I found a star.」
％Ｂ
「What? Seriously?」
Sora
「...See.」
％Ｂ
「Ohh, you're right.」
all
There's a pretty scarlet sea star amidst the lapping waves.
Ousaka's crouched down nearby, staring intently at it.
Misa
「That would be a red sea star.」
Sora
「...Such a pretty shape... It's really like a star.」
Misa
「The Japanese word for sea star refers to a person's hand, but they are first and foremost stars of the sea.」


Sora
「...Stars of the sea!」
Ousaka's eyes light up.
Misa
「The French word is "étoile de mer," which literally translates to the same phrase.」
Sora
「...Ohh!」
Her nostrils flare. Looks like she's getting even more excited.
Misa
「There are theories that say that the five-pointed symbol we often use for stars originates with this shape.」

Sora
「...Sea stars are amazing!」
％Ｂ
「So does that mean that you were referring to sea stars when you said this was the planetarium of the sea?」

all
Misa
「Oh, no, I was not. This is indeed our destination, but this sea star would not be what I wished to show you...」


She looks around.
Misa
「Oh, it seems they are here!」
all
An old man comes walking over to us.
From the wrinkles on his face, he looks like he's maybe sixty... no, seventy years old.
His slightly darkened skin speaks to his experience.
Misa
「Hello. It's very nice to see you again.」
Fisher
「It's been a while since I've seen you last, Misa-chan.」
％Ｂ
「Misa-chan?」
Seems like she's on pretty good terms with this old guy.
％Ｂ
「A high school girl who's acquainted with fishermen...」
Don't see that every day.
Misa
「I'd like to introduce you all. This is Keizou-san. He's a fisher in this town.」

all
％Ｂ
「It's very nice to meet you.」
We lower our heads to Keizou-san.
He might be the one Okihara-senpai called on the phone the other day.

Keizou
「I've already heard from Misa-chan. So you all want to see it too.」

％Ｂ
「It?」
Keizou
「The weather is good today, and the ocean is calm too. I'm sure we'll be able to see it for sure once the sun goes down at this rate. Well, just take your time and wait 'til then.」


The old fisher then smiles and leaves.
％Ｂ
「Once the sun goes down...」
I look up at the sky.
The sun's just about passed its zenith.
Sora
「...We can study sea stars until then.」
％Ｂ
「That sounds good. Let's all compete to see who can find the prettiest one!」
Marika
「Wow～ That sounds fun! I'm not going to lose!」
all
We decide to enjoy ourselves while we wait.
And now that I think about it, this is also another way of experiencing the naturalist club's activities.

％Ｂ
「So what were you two talking about, Okihara-senpai?」
Misa
「You will just have to wait and see.」
She smiles mysteriously.
all
The sun slowly sinks below the horizon.
Our surroundings gradually dim.
Sora
「This sea star's really pretty. It has seven colors.」
％Ｂ
「Hmm, but I can't really tell with how dark it is. Are there even sea stars that are colored like that?」

Sora
「No mistake. Rainbow.」
all
We're all crouched down, intent on our sea star hunt.
Though we can barely spot them anymore because it's gotten pretty dark.
Marika
「...Huh?」
％Ｂ
「What's up?」
Marika
「Oh... I feel like I saw the ocean light up just now... Maybe it's just me～?」

％Ｂ
「You sure it wasn't just some light reflecting off the water?」
Marika
「Maybe... but I feel like it wasn't... Oh, it happened again.」

％Ｂ
「Hmm? I bet it's just some light from a car or something that's...」

Sora
「No.」
％Ｂ
「H-Hey...」
She's staring intently at the surface of the water, brow furrowed.

Sora
「The ocean itself is sparkling.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, come on. You too, Ousaka? There's no way the ocean would―」

all
％Ｂ
「...It totally is.」
Marika
「Wha...What's going on～!?」
Sora
「...Hahh...」
％Ｂ
「What the heck... Y-You're kidding me!」
The ocean's lighting up.
The water's glittering and sparkling across the coast!
％Ｂ
「...It's like there are stars shining inside the ocean.」
Misa
「These are sea fireflies.」
％Ｂ
「Sea fireflies?」
Misa
「They are bioluminescent arthropods that are found ubiquitously throughout coastal regions in the Pacific Ocean. They are tiny crustaceans that are only a few millimeters long.」

％Ｂ
「Uhh... They're crustaceans, so does that mean they're related to shrimp and crabs?」
Misa
「Yes. They are nocturnal, and as you can see, they are noted for this blue luminescence. They sleep within the sands during the day, and become active like this during the night.」


Misa
「The luminescence is thought to be a way to scare off predators, or to communicate danger to others of their kind. And the males are also said to luminesce for mating purposes.」


％Ｂ
「So they're actually like fireflies...」
all
Sora
「...Pretty.」
Marika
「Yeah... It's like we're seeing that planetarium again.」

all
％Ｂ
「I get it now... So this is the planetarium of the sea that you were talking about?」

Misa
「Yes, it is.」
She smiles happily.
Misa
「Both of my parents are marine scientists. I have been taken by my parents to see many different seas ever since I was young.」


Misa
「Calm seas, rough seas, endlessly blue seas... I could feel the breaths of Earth itself through all of them.」

Misa
「And the sight that most profoundly affected me was the sight of sea fireflies glittering in the darkened waters of the Maldives.」

Misa
「I looked up sea fireflies as soon as I returned to Japan. When I learned that it was possible for me to see the same sight somewhere close to where I live, I jumped up and danced for joy.」


Okihara-senpai dancing... I kinda wanna see that.
Misa
「I have been here so many times already. At times with my parents, at times alone. Keizou-san was very helpful on these trips.」


Misa
「Isn't it mysterious? There are so many countries, words, and cultures that exist in this world. But we can all be moved the same way like this.」


Misa
「I have wanted to know more and more about the mysterious ocean ever since then. That is the reason why I am so endlessly drawn to it.」


Marika
「Yeah, I think I can understand how you could get engrossed after seeing this when you were small～」

Misa
「It may be very late... but I now understand why my parents showed me all of those seas.」

％Ｂ
「Because... they really loved you?」
Misa
「That may also be true, but I do not believe it to be the only reason.」

Misa
「My parents' dream and most fervent wish was to communicate the emotions that the ocean evokes with others. That is why my father involved himself with the construction of Marinpia Shionagi.」
Misa
「They wanted me to understand the wonder of the mother of life, the ocean. And they wished for me to become someone who could show that wonder to others. I believe those were their intentions.」


Misa
「After showing all of you these sea fireflies today, I feel as if I have inherited some of my parents' feelings. I'm filled with happiness.」


Misa
「If I could borrow your strength for the Tanabata Festival too, and communicate even the slightest fraction of the wonder of the ocean... Nothing would make me happier.」


％Ｂ
「If it's you, Okihara-senpai, you can do it. Let's do it for sure!」

Marika
「I'm sure that you'll be able to move the hearts of everyone at the Tanabata Festival!」

％Ｂ
「We'll work hard and help out as much as we can! Let's make both the naturalist and astronomy clubs' displays a success!」

Misa
「Thank you very much!」

Marika
「Let's work hard together, Ousaka-san.」
all
Sora
「...」
Marika
「Ousaka-san?」
％Ｂ
「What's wrong, Ousaka?」
Sora
「...」
Ousaka doesn't turn to look at us. She just silently continues to watch the sea fireflies.
