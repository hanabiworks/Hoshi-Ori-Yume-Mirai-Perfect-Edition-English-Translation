「I have a once-in-a-lifetime request for you, Narusawa-san.」
Rikka
「...I'm not letting you borrow my notes.」
Once-in-a-lifetime request, shot down.
％Ｂ
「Wha...!? Um, seriously! I'm begging you!」
Rikka
「I'm not saying it to be mean. I have my own studying to do for exams.」

％Ｂ
「C-Couldn't you do something about that, please!? I'm begging you! Narusawa-sama! Rikka-sama!」

I clap my hands together and bow.
Rikka
「Wha, don't call me weird names! People are looking at us!」

％Ｂ
「Please, come on! The exams have stuff that I haven't learned at this school 'cause I transferred in. I'm seriously in trouble at this rate!」


％Ｂ
「I heard from Sora that you have to take supplementary lessons if you fail. I won't be able to help with the Tanabata Festival if that happens... Come on, please! Please! I'm begging you!」


Rikka
「Geez... Fine. But give them back as soon as you're done copying the parts you don't know, okay?」


Natsuki
「Of course! I'm in your debt, Rikka-sama!」
％Ｂ
「...」
Rikka
「...」
％Ｂ
「Segawa... You too...?」
Natsuki
「I only need math and physics... so please, Rikka-sama! Please let me borrow your notes!」

Rikka
「What is wrong with you two...?」

After-school club activities are on hold starting today to allow for studying.\n\r

So Sora and I decided to meet up on the roof for lunch break.
％Ｂ
「...But you're only allowed to be on the roof for astronomy club activities, right? You sure we should be up here to eat lunch?」


Sora
「...No issues.」
She pulls out a notebook.
She flips it open to a page with a diagram of what looks like a pie chart split into twelve segments, and points to the center.

Sora
「...Studying sundials.」
I see... Astronomy club activities indeed...
％Ｂ
「By the way, you sure you don't need to be eating with your friends?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
Sora
「...I'm always with my friends in class. But I can only see you during lunch break right now.」




Sora
「...And they all were really happy to let me go when I told them I was going to be eating with you.」




％Ｂ
「Really... Well, it's only until exams are over anyway.」
Sora
「...*nod* I want them to be over soon.」
％Ｂ
「Hm?」
Sora
「...Because we can watch the stars together again once they're over.」
She's so casual about saying something so sweet.
Sora
「...Are you okay for exams?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, I got Narusawa to lend me her notes. Okihara-senpai said she'd go over her old exams with me too, so I'm feeling like I'll be able to manage.」


Sora
「...I wish I could teach you.」
％Ｂ
「The sentiment's more than enough.」
％Ｂ
「Anyway, I'll do my best to not fail any exams. And I'll be looking into stuff for getting the planetarium idea to work out too.」

Sora
「...You don't need to overwork yourself. Focus on studying.」
％Ｂ
「I know. Don't worry, I know my limits.」
％Ｂ
「I've got my schedule planned out more or less. I'm gonna eat after I get home today, and then study until about ten.」


％Ｂ
「I'll take a bath after that, and then do some research for the planetarium for about an hour. And then I'll study some more. That's pretty much the plan.」


Sora
「...How late are you going to study until?」
％Ｂ
「Until I can't do any more, obviously.」
Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「Don't be so worried. I'll be fine. Though I am worried about how I'm gonna wake up the next day...」

I'll probably be fine if I set like five alarms, each one five minutes apart.

Sora
「...I'll wake you up then.」
％Ｂ
「Hm?」
Sora
「...I'll send you a message on LIME in the morning. I'll call you if you don't respond. How about that?」

％Ｂ
「You're not starting with the phone call?」
Sora
「Actually typing a reply to the message will wake you up.」
％Ｂ
「I get it... but you know, I might not reply on purpose 'cause I wanna hear your voice.」

Sora
「...No issues.」
％Ｂ
「You sure?」
Sora
「Getting to hear your voice in the morning would make me happy too.」



She flushes a little bashfully.
