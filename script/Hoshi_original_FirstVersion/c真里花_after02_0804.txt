The day of our ceremony―
A cool ocean breeze mingles with the bright sunlight. It's a refreshing summer day.

Mother
「Oh, you've actually cleaned up rather well. I'm seeing you in a new light now.」

Father
「Hmhm. I see what they mean when they say the clothes make the man.」
％Ｂ
「What are you talking about...?」
Father
「Oh? Or maybe you're saying it's more correct to say the clothes make the father?」
Mother
「Oh my! We should start saving money for our grandchild right away!」
％Ｂ
「No, that's not what I... Anyway, I'm gonna go check in on Marika.」

Mother
「Okay. I'm sure she's very pretty.」
Father
「We'll go drop by and say hi later.」
I step away from my parents and head toward the bride's chambers.
％Ｂ
「Here's Marika's room. She said she was done getting ready... Hey, I'm coming in!」


Marika
「G-Go ahead～」
％Ｂ
「Oh...」
When I open the door...
Marika
「...Ehe.」
I see Marika there, standing in a pure white wedding dress.
％Ｂ
「...」
I'm struck dumb by her beauty.
I was there during the fittings, and when we decided on this dress too...

But she's shining far more brightly than back then.
Marika
「What's wrong? You're just standing there...」

％Ｂ
「Well... I was just thinking about how pretty you are.」
Marika
「A-Am I? Does it look good on me～?」
％Ｂ
「It looks really good. You're absolutely beautiful.」
Marika
「Tha...Thank you～」
She turns red and looks downward.
She really is pretty.
I almost can't take my eyes off of her.
Marika
「...I'm glad.」
Marika
「Because I want to become your bride... looking as pretty as I possibly can.」
％Ｂ
「You're prettier than anyone else. More than anyone else in the whole world.」
It's not a lie. It's not flattery.
I genuinely believe it.
Yumi
「Marika, I'm coming in～」
Marika
「Oh, Mom.」
Yumi
「Come on, dear. Don't be embarrassed, let's see Marika during her happiest moment.」
Kouji
「R-Right...」
My mother-in-law, wearing a kimono, and my father-in-law, wearing a tuxedo, walk in.

Yumi
「Oh my, Marika... You're so pretty!」
Marika
「Ahaha～ Thank you very much～」
Yumi
「Don't you think so too, dear?」
Kouji
「H-Hm... It looks good on you.」
Her mom's face is alight.
Her father looks a little embarrassed still, but he doesn't look displeased.

Yumi
「Fufufu...」
And next, they look at me.
Yumi
「And Ryousuke-kun... you look great too. Don't you think so too, dear?」

Yumi
「And... you look great too. Don't you think so too, dear?」

Kouji
「Hm... Well, you know... Um...」
Kouji
「You look good, Ryousuke.」
Kouji
「You look good.」
％Ｂ
「Oh...」
Those words hit me hard.
％Ｂ
「Thank you very much. I'll do my best today.」

Yumi
「Fufu... Don't be too nervous now. We'll go greet the others, then. Let's go, dear.」


Kouji
「R-Right.」
Yumi
「Oh, and by the way, your friends are here. I'm sure they'll come here too soon enough.」

％Ｂ
「Our friends... So they're already here.」
I look at the time.
We've been preparing since morning, and it's about time for everyone to arrive.

A while after Marika's mom and dad leave...
％Ｂ
「Hm?」
I hear something kinda familiar.
That's...
Natsuki
「Long time no see～」
％Ｂ
「Oh, Segawa!!」
Natsuki
「Man, I've been hearing about you two over LIME this entire time. Do you know what Marika said to me after you proposed to her?」

Marika
「W-Wah～ ...That's a bit～」
Natsuki
「Hehe... I'll keep that secret, then! But she was so happy. And I was happy for you two too.」


Natsuki
「I'll take shot after shot to celebrate your day today, as your cameraman! Leave the memories to me!」

％Ｂ
「Sorry about that. I wish you could just relax and eat, but...」
Natsuki
「It's fine! And besides, sitting still just isn't me. I bet I'd be going crazy from wanting to take photos!」


％Ｂ
「Hahaha, fair enough.」
Segawa's a genuine professional cameraman now.
She's apparently working as an assistant at a studio.
Which means that taking photos like this is part of her job.
％Ｂ
「We're counting on you today.」
Natsuki
「Just leave it to me! I'll make perfect photos out of this wonderful day in your lives!」


Marika
「I'm glad you're here～」
Natsuki
「Oh, right. The others are all here too!」
More and more of our friends come in as we talk.
Misa
「Hello, you two. Thank you so very much for inviting me today.」

Sora
「Congratulations.」
Touko
「Wow～ You look so cute～! We'll have to change into our dresses soon too.」

Rikka
「The venue really gives the wedding feel too.」
Marika
「Thanks for coming, everyone.」
％Ｂ
「This place has a really big changing room, so you guys can take your time changing in there.」

I rented out the venue's changing room, since I figured it'd be for the best if we could take as much time as we wanted changing.

The girls are all going to dress up there before attending.
Seeing all of their faces makes me feel like I've suddenly gone back in time.\n\r

It's so nostalgic.
Shuuichi
「Hey, come on. Aren't you forgetting about someone?」
％Ｂ
「Hm?」
Shuuichi
「Yo. Been a while.」
％Ｂ
「Shuuichi...!」
％Ｂ
「"It's been so long!" ...Not. We went out for drinks just the other day.」

Shuuichi
「Guess we did. It was pretty painful for me and the 15,000 yen I have as my allowance... but it was all for the sake of celebrating you getting married.」


％Ｂ
「R-Really...」
Shuuichi
「But now it's your turn to taste the same pain. By the way, what's Ryousuke's allowance gonna be?」

Shuuichi
「But now it's your turn to taste the same pain. By the way, what's his allowance gonna be?」

Marika
「Hmm... I don't think I really put that much thought into it... Since we both have jobs...」

Marika
「We'll set aside enough for living expenses and savings, and then you can use the rest however you want♪」
％Ｂ
「Ohhh, thanks so much!」
Shuuichi
「Kh... Look at you showing off! But just wait until you have a kid!」

％Ｂ
「A kid? You mean...」
Baby
「Waaahhh! Waaaahhh!」
I can hear a baby crying somewhere.
Is that...?
Shuuichi
「Ahhhh, Kanon-chan!!」
Shuuichi sprints over.
Kaori
「Congratulations～」
Kaori-san appears, holding a baby.
Marika
「W-Wah～ ...She's so cute～!」
Kaori
「This is Kanon～! You can call her Non-chan～」

Kaori-san takes the baby's hand and waves it.
She's an adorable baby.
Shuuichi got married before us.
And now he's a father.
I'm happy that Kaori-san came too.
Marika
「This'll be a great ceremony.」
％Ｂ
「Seriously.」
I'm genuinely happy that there are so many people here to celebrate our union.

Solemn music plays in the wedding venue.
The attendees are quietly waiting for the moment.
I wait for her alone at the altar.
The doors open slowly.
Two people step out.
They slowly walk down the wedding aisle.
My father-in-law, looking nervous.
And Marika in her wedding dress, gracefully walking along with her hand in her father's.

I clench the gloves in my hand on reflex.
This must be what it feels like to have your breath taken away.
Marika's shining.
Her face is hidden beneath her veil...
But she looks beautiful. She's a genuine angel.
I can feel the purity of my love for her.
The choir hymn begins.
The attendees happily sing along too.
Seeing them all celebrate our special moment fills my heart with joy.

Marika
「...Ehe...」
Eventually, we both step forward and look into each other's eyes.
I can see her smile brightly.
Her eyes are a little damp.
And the same goes for mine.
How could they not be? With how happy I am...
Priest
「The groom, Ryousuke.」
Priest
「The groom.」
The priest's voice echoes through the church.
Priest
「You are now to marry the bride, Marika, and take her as your lawfully wedded wife. Do you vow to love your wife from the bottom of your heart?」

％Ｂ
「I do.」
Priest
「Do you vow to be true to her for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, until death do you part?」


％Ｂ
「I do.」
％Ｂ
「I, ％Ｂ... vow to love you, Marika, as my wife. For better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health... until death do us part.」
We've decided to recite our vows ourselves.
We wanted to put our promises into our own words, with our own voices.
Priest
「The bride, Marika.」
Priest
「You are now to marry the groom, Ryousuke, and take him as your lawfully wedded husband. Do you vow to love your husband from the bottom of your heart?」

Priest
「You are now to marry the groom and take him as your lawfully wedded husband. Do you vow to love your husband from the bottom of your heart?」

Marika
「I do.」
Priest
「Do you vow to be true to him for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, until death do you part?」


Marika
「I do.」
Marika
「I, Marika... vow to love you, Ryousuke, as my husband. For better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health... until death do us part.」


Marika
「I, Marika... vow to love you as my husband. For better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health... until death do us part.」


Her words don't falter in the slightest.
I can keenly feel her determination and love.
Priest
「You may now kiss the bride.」
I grab her slender hands tight.
Her hands have always been this small. Ever since we first met.
But Marika wasn't helpless.
She's been grabbing hold of all sorts of things with these hands, all this time.
I carefully lift her veil.
Marika's smiling at me, looking straight into my eyes.
Her smile seems several times more dazzling than before.
％Ｂ
「...Marika. Thank you for marrying me.」

Marika
「I should be the one saying that.」
Marika
「I'm so happy...」
We gently kiss.
And so, we seal our love.
Marika
「...Mh...」
At this moment... We become husband and wife, in the most legitimate way.

Wedding Announcer
「And now, the bride will read a letter of gratitude to her parents.」

Kouji
「Y-Yes.」
We already told him this would be happening, but Marika's dad still looks a little apprehensive when he stands up.

Kouji
「Be strong, Marika.」
Yumi
「Don't cry so much that you can't read it, okay?」
Marika
「Ahaha～ I'll be okay～」
Marika slowly unfolds the letter that she had prepared.
I step next to her with a microphone in hand.
Her voice is clear, and strong.
She gently calls out to the two people who are so precious to her.
She's smiling, but crying like a little kid as she finishes reading.

Warm applause fills the venue.
Kouji
「Gh... Hghh... Hnghhh...」
Yumi
「...Sniff... aahh...」
Her mom and dad are both openly crying.
Especially her dad. His nose is even running.
Marika
「Mom, Dad. I'm going to be happy with the person I love.」

Her last, quiet statement.
I lower the microphone and grab Marika's hand.
I'm never going to let this hand go.
After that...
Our happy wedding ceremony passes in the blink of an eye.
％Ｂ
「I'm sure you're tired, Marika.」
We're back in the waiting chambers, and I'm showing my appreciation for my bride's efforts.
％Ｂ
「Must've been rough being in that dress the whole time, right?」
Marika
「Ahaha, just a bit～」
Marika
「But it was fun. I almost wish I could wear this forever.」
％Ｂ
「It gets me a little sad knowing that it's only gonna be for today.」
Marika
「Exactly～ Everyone told me how pretty I was too.」
Marika
「I think I might've been told I'm pretty enough to last me a lifetime today...」
％Ｂ
「I'll say it even more. Today and in the future.」
Marika
「Oh, I'm so happy～ ...Please do, then!」
Marika
「But... It's embarrassing when you say it with a straight face like that... You're pretty drunk, aren't you?」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, I ended up being forced to drink a ton...」
％Ｂ
「Our parents, people from work, our friends, everyone kept pouring, so it's not like I was just gonna say no.」
Marika
「Hehe... I'm sure you're tired.」
％Ｂ
「Well, there's still the reception after this, so I'll have to keep drinking.」
％Ｂ
「I hear the others are planning something for us.」
Marika
「Whaaaat? ...I'm excited～」
％Ｂ
「Though we have to wait a bit, since there's apparently still stuff they have to prepare.」
％Ｂ
「But sitting here like this for a while isn't so bad.」
Marika
「Yeah, I want to drink it all in... for a little longer.」
I feel the same way.
I want to be enveloped in this happy mood for just a little bit more.
Marika
「...U-Um.」
％Ｂ
「Hm?」
Marika
「Actually～」
％Ｂ
「What?」
Marika
「You know how I read that letter for my parents at the end?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, that was amazing. I got emotional too.」
Marika
「Th-Thanks～」
Marika
「So, um... I actually wrote another letter.」
％Ｂ
「What!? You mean...」
Marika
「It's for you, Ryousuke.」
Marika
「It's for you.」
％Ｂ
「For me?」
Marika
「A letter from the bride to the groom... I guess.」
％Ｂ
「Really...」
She even prepared something like that...
Marika
「There's just still some things I can't normally say face to face. So I wanted to take the opportunity to tell you... Is that okay?」


％Ｂ
「Yeah, of course. I wanna hear it.」
Marika
「Okay, then...」
She carefully takes out a small card.
Marika
「Dear Ryousuke,」
Marika
「To my husband, starting today,」
She addresses me tenderly.
Marika
「It has already been over ten years since I first met you back in grade school.」

Marika
「To be honest, I don't remember our first meeting very clearly.」

Marika
「I was suffering from my asthma at the time. I remembered that there was a boy who tried hard to help me, but it wasn't something that was too clear in my memories.」


Marika
「But, with every passing day, your presence grew bigger for me.」
Marika
「We parted after you moved away, but you were always in my heart after that.」

Marika
「Your smiling face when we met again.\nYour serious face when you first told me you liked me. Your sparkling face when you're facing your dreams.」


Marika
「Your diligent face when you're focused on work.\nYour nervous face when you proposed to me.」

Tears fall from her eyes, as if she couldn't hold them in any longer.
Marika
「I love all of the faces you make so very much. I'll never forget them for as long as I live.」

Marika
「I feel genuinely blessed that I am able to be the bride of someone as kind and attractive as you.」

Marika
「I am sure we will encounter problems throughout our marriage, but I will always, always love you.」

Marika
「I wish that one day I can give birth to your child, and create the world's happiest household with you.」

Marika
「I may still be inadequate, but I will do everything I can, so that I can offer you even the slightest amount of strength. I would like to smile together with you forever.」


She lays the letter down.
She looks at me with teary eyes.
Marika
「Thank you... for loving me.」
Marika
「To Ryousuke. The one I love more than anyone else in the world. From, Marika.」
Marika
「To the one I love more than anyone else in the world. From, Marika.」
％Ｂ
「Marika... Thank you.」
Marika
「Hnnhh～ ...I was able to say it～」
I gently stroke her shaking back.
I'm going to make Marika happy.
I've made the vow so many times already, and I make it again.
It means everything to me.
