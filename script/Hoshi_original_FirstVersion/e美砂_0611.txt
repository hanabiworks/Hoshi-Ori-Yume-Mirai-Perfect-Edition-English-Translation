 The next day.
I'm heading toward the third-year classrooms to go see Okihara-senpai.
％Ｂ
「Oh... Okihara-senpai!」
And I just happen to spot her from behind in the hallway.
Misa
「My, my. Hello. How very rare for us to meet in a place like this.」

％Ｂ
「I was actually just about to head over to your classroom.」
Misa
「Did you have something you wished to discuss with me, perhaps?」
％Ｂ
「Yes, I wanted to speak with you.」
Misa
「Well, well. Thank you very much for going so far out of your way to do so.」

She bows her head low.
％Ｂ
「W-Well, um... You don't have to go that far to... You're an upperclassman to me, so it's okay to be less formal.」

Misa
「Yes, but this is a happy occasion. And so, what did you wish to discuss?」

％Ｂ
「Uhh... It's actually about what we spoke about yesterday... when I said I wanted you and Ousaka to teach us about what's interesting about your activities this weekend.」

Misa
「I'm very sorry. I have not yet decided...」
％Ｂ
「Oh, no, that's not why I'm here! You already said that you would tell us on the day of, and I'm completely okay with that...」


％Ｂ
「I actually came looking for you today because I was afraid I might have caused you some trouble with that request.」

Both she and Ousaka said yes more or less immediately yesterday.
But Okihara-senpai seemed a little troubled too.
And that's been stuck in my mind...
Misa
「That you... caused me trouble?」
％Ｂ
「Yes, it seemed that way, so I was a bit worried.」
Misa
「Not at all!」
She shakes her head vigorously.
Misa
「There is absolutely no way I am troubled. If anything, I'm very happy to hear that you wished to know more about my club activities.」


％Ｂ
「...Is that true? It just seemed like, um...」
Misa
「When we spoke yesterday, I thought about where I could take you so you could understand what I find so interesting about the ocean.」

Misa
「There were just too many places that I could have recommended, and I couldn't pick just one, and so I was thinking very hard on the matter.」

％Ｂ
「...Are there really that many?」
Misa
「Far too many to pick just one. That would be why I looked troubled.」

％Ｂ
「It's okay to be more casual about it...」
Misa
「It is not! If I am to invite all of you somewhere, I would like it to be the most wonderful place possible.」


Misa
「Please wait just one moment. I'll narrow it down to ten right now, and so from those ten...! I'll divide them up between shallows, pelagic, and deep sea...!」


％Ｂ
「Uhh... J-Just a second, please. Uhh, let's see... How about something like this, then?」


％Ｂ
「Out of all of the seas that you've seen, which one moved you the most?」
Misa
「The sea that moved me the most?」
Misa
「That would certainly have to be the Maldives!」
％Ｂ
「The Maldives!?」
A foreign country...
Misa
「My parents took me on a vacation there when I was five years old. They say that the Maldives's name comes from the Sanskrit words for "garland of islands."」


Misa
「The Maldives has 26 atolls, with approximately 1,200 islands within them. Oh, an atoll would be the name for a ring-shaped coral reef.」


Misa
「And so the "garland of islands" is a phrase that compares the many rings of coral reef islands in the Maldives to a garland of flowers!」


Misa
「With its exceedingly transparent waters and islands of white sand, it is as if all life on Earth itself began there. The instant I saw that sea, I was overfilled with excitement, and found myself brought to tears simply by―」

％Ｂ
「Um... M-May I interrupt?」
％Ｂ
「I understand that you were very moved by the Maldives... but you aren't actually considering that as one of the options for this weekend, have you?」

Misa
「Oh, of course I am.」
％Ｂ
「I-I see. I would certainly love to go...」
...I'd have to get a passport first, though.
％Ｂ
「B-But, if it's possible to restrict the location to somewhere within Japan... or more like near Shionagi, and still be able to experience those kinds of emotions...」

Misa
「Near... Shionagi?」
％Ｂ
「Well, I'm sure it wouldn't be possible to experience the emotions you felt at the Maldives, though.」

Misa
「Oh no, it is very possible!」
％Ｂ
「Wha?」
Misa
「So you would like me to take you to a location where you can experience the same emotions as you would when seeing the Maldives, in Japan?」

％Ｂ
「Y-Yes... If such a place exists, that is.」
Misa
「Then please, allow me to do so!」
Does... Does a place like that exist?
all
She pulls out her phone and starts making a call somewhere as I stare at her blankly.

Misa
「...Hello? This is Misa... Yes, thank you very much for your help on that occasion.」

Misa
「I was wondering if my friends and I could visit this weekend... Yes, that... Would that be okay? Yes, then I will call again at a later date.」


Misa
「Thank you very much. Please excuse me.」
She smiles after hanging up.
Misa
「We are good to go!」
％Ｂ
「Seriously!?」
Misa
「Yes. I promise to take you all to a very wonderful place.」

％Ｂ
「Ohh...」
I can't believe a place like that really exists in Japan...
I'm starting to get excited for the weekend.
all
...Oh, maybe I should bring a swimsuit and stuff?
