「Come on, man... That didn't work at all.」
％Ｂ
「...You think so too?」
Shuuichi
「You're up against someone pretty tough. Maybe it was too much for you.」

％Ｂ
「D-Don't give up yet! I just haven't gotten serious yet!」

Shuuichi
「Why didn't you just start serious!? Don't set yourself up to fail!」

But despite my bluffing... I have absolutely zero strategies.
I wish I could think of something...
Shuuichi
「Why don't you just give up if it seems like she's not interested? It's a shame to give up on Yukimura's big name, but...」

％Ｂ
「...Wait just a little more. You never thought it'd be easy to get her to join, right?」

Shuuichi
「No, I didn't, but... Well, if you don't want to give up, then I won't stop you.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah. Let me handle this. I'll figure something out.」
all
％Ｂ
「It's great that I've told him that and all... but this is gonna be pretty difficult.」
Either way, I need to start by getting Yukimura interested in what the event organization committee does.\n\r

It'd be great if there were something that could catch her interest...
Marika
「Sorry, I got a little tied up.」
％Ｂ
「It's fine, I was only just about to start. All right, let's give it our all today!」

Marika
「Yeah, let's do it!」
all
％Ｂ
「That all for today?」
Marika
「Um... Yeah, it looks like that's everything for us.」
Shinozaki's checking the paperwork we've received against our list.
Looks like we've managed to gather all the paperwork without a hitch.
I'm planning on going to try to persuade Yukimura again after this... but I still don't know what to do.
Maybe I should try asking Shinozaki for advice?
Ask her.
I'll think about it on my own.
There's a limit to how much I can come up with on my own.
Let's get Shinozaki's opinion.
％Ｂ
「Shinozaki, can I get your opinion on something?」
Marika
「Mine?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. I'm actually thinking of getting Yukimura to join the event committee.」
Marika
「...Yukimura-san? Why?」
％Ｂ
「I want her to be a part of our group more. So I was thinking of what the best way to get her to join the event committee would be.」


Marika
「Hmm... But she's said no to every club that's tried to get her to join, hasn't she? I wonder if she'd join...」

％Ｂ
「I'm asking her to join to help her say no to those clubs too. I think those clubs might stop trying to recruit her if she joins the event committee.」


Marika
「That's true. The event committee's a lot of work, so I don't think anyone could be in another club at the same time.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, that's the issue... She was like, "Sounds like a pain," and didn't seem interested at all yesterday.」

Marika
「Yeah, we're busiest around the Tanabata Festival. I can see why Yukimura-san might not want to.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, exactly... So I was wondering if you had any ideas.」

Marika
「Let's see... It'd be easy if there were something about the committee's activities that interested her...」

％Ｂ
「That's the biggest issue. I want to find something that would make her interested...」

Marika
「Hmm... Let's see... Umm, umm...」
...We've stopped walking.
I guess if I'm gonna ask Shinozaki for her opinion, it'd need to be somewhere we could calmly and carefully discuss things.

Marika
「Oh, isn't that... Yukimura-san?」
all
_00cutinBS
％Ｂ
「Huh? Oh, you're right.」
Things might go differently if it's with Shinozaki.
Let's try calling out to her.
I've promised to Yukimura that I wouldn't talk about the old school building to anyone else.
I can always try asking Shinozaki for advice later if I end up failing a few more times.

％Ｂ
「Let's turn this paperwork in and wrap things up for the day, then.」
Marika
「Yeah, let's do that.」
I want as much time as possible to try to convince her.
Finishing up my work quickly is for the best.
all
_00cutinBS
％Ｂ
「Wait, that's... Yukimura.」
But then I spot the exact individual I'm thinking of.
Maybe trying to persuade her together with Shinozaki might end up being some kind of a breakthrough.
_00cutinBS
％Ｂ
「Yo, Yukimura. What are you doing here?」
Touko
「Mmm... Taking a walk, I guess. Are you two doing committee work? Having stuff to do every day sounds rough.」

Marika
「Hello, Yukimura-san. Do you like taking walks?」
Touko
「Yeah, I do. I like to just wander around without any goal in mind. Though I don't like how hot it is around this time of year.」

％Ｂ
「It's only gonna get hotter. What are you gonna do then?」

Touko
「I'll try my best to walk in the shade. I can enjoy air conditioning if I walk from store to store too.」

Marika
「Ahaha, that sounds fun. You might want to eat shaved ice while you're walking around in this heat too.」

％Ｂ
「Maybe we should all go get some together sometime? I bet there'd be lots of stalls selling shaved ice at the Tanabata Festival.」

Touko
「Mmm... If I feel like it, maybe.」
But whenever we try to invite her to do something, she doesn't seem too interested.
Man... What should I do?
all
％Ｂ
「...Hm?」
Marika
「It's a piano... It's probably coming from the music classrooms. It must be Narusawa-san.」
％Ｂ
「Narusawa's piano playing always sounds so pretty. Shinozaki, wanna go listen for a bit?」

Marika
「Mhm, I think I might want to. Yukimura-san, do you want to come too?」

Touko
「I'm fine. Why don't you two enjoy your date together?」
Marika
「W-We aren't on a date...! We were doing event committee work...!」

Touko
「Ahaha! Denying it like that just makes me even more suspicious! I think you should be more honest with yourself.」

Marika
「I'm telling the truth...! I'm just helping out...!」

％Ｂ
「Hey, Yukimura. I asked Shinozaki to help me. Don't make fun of her when she's only being helpful, all right?」

Touko
「Okaaay. I got lectured.」
Marika
「Um, I don't mind...! Anyway, Yukimura-san, let's go to the music classroom together, okay?」

Touko
「I already told you I'm not going. You two go enjoy it by yourselves.」
Marika
「I won't force you if you have other plans... but Narusawa's piano playing is really nice. Let's go listen together.」


Touko
「Mmm... I'm not that interested, though.」
Marika
「I know you'd think it's wonderful if you listened to it. Right

, Hino-kun

? Don't you think so?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. I've got absolutely zero sense for music, and I still think it's great.」
Marika
「I'm sure you'd like it too, Yukimura-san. Come on, let's hurry.」

Touko
「I-I never said I'd...! Wait, don't pull me...!」

％Ｂ
「Sorry, Yukimura. Tag along with us.」
Marika
「She might finish playing if we don't hurry. I'm sure Narusawa-san would want you to listen to her play too.」


Touko
「Gh... Okay, fine...! Just for a little, okay!?」
Marika
「...I knew it was Narusawa-san.」
Narusawa seems to have noticed we're here, but she doesn't stop playing.\n\r

Her ability to focus is impressive.
Touko
「I said I didn't need to come... Could you let go of me already?」

Marika
「I won't. You'll run away if I do, won't you～? Let's listen until the very end.」

Shinozaki's being unexpectedly stubborn about this.
Yukimura seems to have realized too. She sighs, and grudgingly listens to Narusawa's performance.

all
Narusawa's piano playing has this strange way of pulling you in.
I dunno anything technical about music, so I can't really put it into words well... but it just feels warm.

％Ｂ
「It's like it's not just that she's good at playing... It's more like she's talking to my heart...」

Marika
「Oh, I get what you mean. It sounds like the sound of the piano is communicating with us.」

Touko
「...She must've practiced for a really long time.」
％Ｂ
「I bet. She's probably practiced more than we could ever imagine.」

Marika
「She must love playing the piano. She couldn't have gotten this good otherwise.」

The more practice she's put in, the more she shines as she plays.
Narusawa's performance must be backed by her passion and love for the piano.
all
Marika
「That was really wonderful, Narusawa-san.」
Rikka
「Th-Thank you... but it wasn't anything that impressive. Anyway, why are you all here?」

Marika
「I'm sorry. Come on, you two! You need to clap! Don't be rude to Narusawa-san.」

Rikka
「...They don't need to do that.」
Touko
「Well... It's like Flower-chan said. I think it was a wonderful performance.」

Marika
「Ehehe, wasn't it?」
Rikka
「This is a surprise. I didn't think you'd come, Yukimura-san.」
Touko
「I wasn't planning on being brought here either. But, well, I got to see a nice performance, so I'm glad I came.」


Rikka
「Really.」
Touko
「Mhm, I think it's amazing that you have something you can pour your heart into like that. You've put in lots of work, haven't you, Piano-chan?」

Rikka
「Y-You're still calling me that!? I told you not to because it's embarrassing!」

Touko
「Whaaat, why? You're Piano-chan because you love the piano. It's simple, isn't it?」

Marika
「Ahaha, it's so cute. I think "Piano-chan" is perfect for you, Narusawa-san.」

Rikka
「I think your "Flower-chan" is a better fit than mine is for me! I don't want that embarrassing nickname.」

Touko
「Mmm... So that just means they're both perfect, right?」
Rikka
「Do something about this. You're the one who brought her here, aren't you?」

％Ｂ
「Wha? I thought it was perfect too. You don't like it?」
Rikka
「Of course not. Would you want to be called "Architecture-kun"?」

...No, I wouldn't. I have no idea what that would even imply.
It makes it sound like I'm a building or something.
Touko
「Now, now. Don't be so angry. Architecture-kun... I think I'll pass on that one. It's a bit hard to say.」

Rikka
「I can't believe the first nickname anyone's ever given me is "Piano-chan"... It's unbelievably embarrassing.」

％Ｂ
「You've been playing piano for a long time, right? You ever just not wanna play anymore?」

Rikka
「...I've always played, so it's just a part of my life. Besides, I only play because I want to.」

Marika
「But it's still amazing that you've played for so long. I remember I used to get frustrated when I couldn't lower my times back when I did competitive swimming.」


％Ｂ
「Same here. I'd get nervous if things weren't going well in soccer and stuff.」

Rikka
「Everyone has different experiences. I'm not special.」
Marika
「You're really into studying architecture right now, right
, Hino-kun

? Professional stuff like that's really cool.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah. There's a ton to learn once you get started. It's super fun.」
Rikka
「...You really should be "Architecture-kun."」
Marika
「A-Ahaha... What should I do? Do you want me to call you "Architecture-kun" too?」

％Ｂ
「...Please don't.」
Touko
「Anyway, I've got things I need to do, so I'm going home. Thanks for the great performance, Piano-chan.」

％Ｂ
「Uh, Yuki...」
I could just tell she was lying.
She's probably just using that as an excuse to leave.
Marika
「Yukimura-san had things to do...? Maybe I shouldn't have brought her along with us...?」

Rikka
「...I would've at least liked for her to have done something about that nickname before she left.」

Is it just me, or does Narusawa seem happy?
Maybe she actually likes that nickname, even though it's embarrassing.
all
Rikka
「You're all rather good friends, aren't you? I understand you and Shinozaki-san, 
Hino-kun, 
 
but I was surprised Yukimura-san was also with you.」

％Ｂ
「You said that earlier too. Why?」
Rikka
「...She likes being alone, doesn't she? That's how it feels.」

％Ｂ
「I dunno if she likes being alone, but I guess it does seem like it's rare for her to be with other people.」

Marika
「I thought she'd be scarier until I talked to her for the first time, but she's a really nice person. I want to be better friends with her.」

Rikka
「You shouldn't try to force it. I doubt she'd like it.」

％Ｂ
「What?」
Rikka
「It might be different if there were some kind of support... but I wonder.」

Narusawa says it as if she were talking to herself.
Something that supports Yukimura... I wonder what that could be.
I don't know much about her yet... so I have no idea.
all
％Ｂ
「...I'm gonna go. Sorry Shinozaki, but you handle the rest.」
Marika
「Huh? Handle the...? Ah, wait!」
％Ｂ
「...Huh? It's locked.」
I assumed she had gone to the old school building after leaving the music classroom.
Maybe she really did have something to do?
_smh_st_01
_smh_st_btn01
_SMH_ST_01
.........
......
...
％Ｂ
「...She's not picking up.」
_smh_st_04
Maybe... she fell asleep again?
I guess I'll at least let her know over LIME that I came by.
I wanna let her know beforehand that I wanna talk tomorrow too.
％Ｂ
「Hmm... Not today, I guess.」
There's no response from Yukimura.
It's almost time to leave, so I guess I should give up for today...
％Ｂ
「...No response.」
I made no progress at all today.
I was able to interact with her when Shinozaki and Narusawa were around... but I'm still pretty far from being able to understand her.

％Ｂ
「Flower-chan. Haha, it really is perfect for Shinozaki.」
Yukimura's actually pretty good at picking nicknames.
Narusawa's "Piano-chan" is a gimme, but it's definitely perfect.
％Ｂ
「Wonder what Yukimura would be... Kitty-cat?」
...Sounds scandalous.
She'd probably think I was super gross if I called her that.
％Ｂ
「Let's not. I'd be an idiot to destroy our relationship like that after we've gotten just a little closer.」

It wouldn't be a good idea to do anything to upset someone when I'm trying to get closer with them.\n\r

Not like I've ever called girls by nicknames before anyway.
％Ｂ
「...Getting close to someone's pretty hard.」
It takes a step in the right direction to do so.
How do I go about figuring out which direction's the right one?
I guess all I can do for now is just keep talking to her.
I think I'll try going to Yukimura's classroom tomorrow.
