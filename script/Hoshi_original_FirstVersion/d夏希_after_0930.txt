Ryousuke・Natsuki
％Ｂ
「Hey, um! Oh...」
Natsuki
「So, um! Oh...」
％Ｂ・Natsuki
％Ｂ
「Hey, um! Oh...」
Natsuki
「So, um! Oh...」
We synced up again...
％Ｂ
「You can go first.」
Natsuki
「No, mine isn't that important, so you can go first.」

％Ｂ
「Okay. Then, ahem... So, my submission won in the firm competition!」

Natsuki
「Wha... Really!?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah! And the client liked it too, so apparently Azuma-san's going to let me take charge of most of the design with him supporting!」


Natsuki
「That's amazing! Congratulations!」
％Ｂ
「Thanks, Natsuki!」
I hug her tight and kiss her again.
％Ｂ
「I feel like I've finally been able to take my first step forward as an architect now!」

Natsuki
「It's because of all of your hard work
, Ryousuke

. That's great.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah! Oh, okay, you next.」
Natsuki
「Well, you see... They announced the results for the contest today. It's supposed to be up on the website, but I was thinking maybe we could look together?」


％Ｂ
「Oh, right! That was today. Let's look right now!」
all
I place my laptop on the table and open up the contest website.

I move the cursor to the results page button.
Natsuki
「W-Wait a second! I need to take deep breaths and calm down...」

Natsuki
「Suuuh... Hahh... Suuuuhhh... Hahhh...! O-Okay... Then... please!」

all
I click the button.
The results page appears after a bit of loading.
％Ｂ
「Hm...」
Natsuki
「Hm...」
％Ｂ
「Hmmmmh!?」
Natsuki
「Hmmmmh!?」
"Grand Prize Runner-Up: 
Shionagi City, 
％Ａ Natsuki. 
Title: 'Friends'"
We look at each other.
％Ｂ
「Hey... You...!」
Natsuki
「I... won an award...?」
I click the link with the submission title. 
It leads to a familiar-looking photo.
It's without a doubt the one Natsuki took at the Tanabata Festival.

「You did iiiiitt!」
Natsuki
「I did iiiiitt!」
％Ｂ・Natsuki
％Ｂ
「You did iiiiitt!」
Natsuki
「I did iiiiitt!」
We stand up without thinking, hug, and jump into the air.
Natsuki
「I did it! I got an award! An award!」
％Ｂ
「And it's the grand prize runner-up! Holy crap!」
She got the second-place award in a contest that even a professional would be proud of getting an award in!

％Ｂ
「This is actually amazing, isn't it!?」
Natsuki
「I can only say this now, but I was actually pretty confident about that photo, you know! It was a really good photo, if I do say so myself!」

％Ｂ
「Yeah. And you were right, 'cause it got the grand prize runner-up! You're amazing!」


Natsuki
「Eheheeeh!」
％Ｂ
「All right, we're celebrating tonight! Let's go out and get something good to eat! Sushi or barbecue, anything's fine!」

I've taken a big step forward at work, and Natsuki won the grand prize runner-up award in the contest.
If that's not a good enough reason to splurge for once, then I don't know what is!
％Ｂ
「By the way, what's the grand prize winner? I can't believe a photo that's better than yours could even exist.」

Natsuki
「That's true, it'd have to have been better than mine... Wait... Ahhhh!」

She suddenly screams at the screen.
％Ｂ
「Wh-What's wrong!?」
Natsuki
「...Look.」
She points at the screen.
"Grand Prize: Shionagi City. Nishioka Youko. \nTitle: 'Happiness'"
％Ｂ
「Nishioka Youko... Wait a second... Is this Nishioka-sensei...?」
Natsuki
「Nooot faaaair! She never told me she was participating too! That's so sneaky!」

Natsuki
「And when the heck did she have the time to take a photo for this anyway!? She hasn't done any shooting at all lately because we have so much work!」


％Ｂ
「L-Let's take a look.」
all
I click on the title, "Happiness."
An image fills the screen after some loading.
Natsuki
「Whaaaaaaaaaaaa!? She's sooooo sneakyyy!」
The contest grand-prize winner, titled "Happiness."
The photo is of Natsuki and me kissing at the surprise wedding ceremony at our class reunion, with all of our fellow alumni smiling at us.


％Ｂ
「Th-This is... yeah, definitely sneaky...」
So this is what she meant by "I'll be using this afterward"...

I just thought she was going to display it in her store window...

Natsuki
「Sigh～ ...I lost～ ...I never would've thought it'd end up like this.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah... She got you good.」
But Natsuki doesn't look bitter about it at all.
And I don't feel bitter either. I have no complaints about this photo winning the grand prize.
Because when this photo was taken, the two of us really were the happiest people in the world.

We've added yet another new photo to our album of memories.

It's a photo that's a little embarrassing to look at...

But we'll show it to the kids we'll have one day.
And we'll tell them that their mom and dad joined hands in happiness, surrounded by all of these smiles―
