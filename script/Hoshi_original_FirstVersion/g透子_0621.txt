Marika
「I'm glad we found something nice.」
We looked around at a lot of different places, and I eventually settled on two matching memorial capsules we found at an accessories shop.

They have a cute-looking design, with embedded star-shaped pieces of glass.
They also have screw-in tops, and they're designed so you can put a piece of paper with a message inside.

％Ｂ
「I really appreciate you coming. I bet I never would've been able to find these by myself.」
Marika
「Don't mention it. Ehehe, I'm glad I was helpful.」

％Ｂ
「I'll make it up to you sometime. I feel bad not doing anything after all the help I've been getting.」

Marika
「Ahaha, you don't need to worry about that. It's not like I did that much.」

％Ｂ
「No, but...」
Marika
「I wasn't that useful the time you made us lunch. So now we're even.」

％Ｂ
「...Thanks.」
Marika
「I'll be going, then. Good luck.」
all
I watch Shinozaki as she leaves.
I know she said not to worry about it, but she really did help me out a lot... so I'll do something for her sometime.

Touko
「Out shopping together on your day off? ...You two are as close as ever, aren't yooou?」
％Ｂ
「Hgh!? Y-Yukimura!?」
Touko
「Sorry, I was watching you two. I didn't want to get in the way of your date.」

％Ｂ
「Uh, well...」
Touko
「You sure it's okay to let Flower-chan go home like that? Isn't the boy supposed to walk the girl home at the end of a date?」

％Ｂ
「It wasn't a date! She was just helping me with some shopping!」

Touko
「C'mon, you should hurry and go chase after her before she leaves. Don't waste your time talking to me, why not go to her?」

％Ｂ
「...?」
...Is Yukimura angry?
If she's in a bad mood in this situation... Could that mean she's jealous?
This might be a good opportunity for me.
I might be able to find out how she really feels now.

％Ｂ
「I'm not going. 'Cause I wanna talk to you about something.」
I calm myself down.
I recall the feelings that I communicated to her yesterday.
％Ｂ
「Let's change locations. Come with me.」
％Ｂ
「It's a little earlier than I was planning... but there's something I wanna give you.」
I pull out the wrapped present I purchased earlier.
I want to use this to get Yukimura to consider me at least even a little.
％Ｂ
「This is for you. I picked it out for you, and I want you to have it.」

Touko
「...Why for me? Why would you give me a... There's no reason for this.」

％Ｂ
「Because I want to give you one. That's reason enough, right?」
Touko
「...I don't get it. This is too sudden... I don't know how to respond to this.」
％Ｂ
「Why are you in such a bad mood?」
Touko
「...I'm not in a bad mood. You're free to do whatever you want with whoever you want.」

％Ｂ
「So I'm the reason, right? You didn't like that I was with Shinozaki?」

Touko
「N-No, that's not it! Don't put words in my mouth!」

％Ｂ
「Then tell me. Tell me why you're in a bad mood.」
Touko
「...I already told you I'm not in a bad mood.」
％Ｂ
「If you're jealous, then that makes me happy. Because... I've already told you how I felt yesterday and the day before.」

I hold out the present again.
I want Yukimura to accept this, and my feelings too.
％Ｂ
「If you don't accept this, I'm throwing it away. There's no point if you don't accept it.」

Touko
「...You're unfair.」
She grudgingly accepts the present.
She slowly unwraps it to reveal the small capsule inside.

Touko
「...? Why did you give me this...?」
％Ｂ
「There's a piece of paper inside for you to write a wish on. This one's mine.」
I show her my own capsule.
I unscrew the top half and take out the piece of paper inside.
I wrote my wish on it back in the accessories store.
My wish was... "To have courage."
Touko
「I-I... What am I supposed to do with something like this...!?」
％Ｂ
「This is my wish. I wrote my own wish on here, so I can tell you how I feel.」

Touko
「...And what am I supposed to wish for?」
％Ｂ
「I... didn't really use this as a wish. It's more like something to get me started. Because... I knew I had to tell you how I feel.」


％Ｂ
「You're free to make whatever wish you want. If you don't have anything in particular to wish for, then you can leave it blank. And if you don't need it... then throw it away.」


Touko
「...Why are you so determined?」
％Ｂ
「What?」
Touko
「I don't get it. You're so serious about this... I just can't understand why.」

I can tell how she feels from her voice and her face.
She seems hesitant and doubtful. It's completely different from her usual relaxed demeanor.

Touko
「Aren't you afraid? Doesn't thinking about being separated make you scared and worried!?」


％Ｂ
「...」
Touko
「That's why I was alone! But then you... got closer and closer to me, and...!」

％Ｂ
「...Am I close to you?」
Touko
「You're the closest to me, aren't you!? You were closer than anyone, and you'd chase after me when I ran away...! It became natural for us to be together every day!」


I'm happy.
I was just that important to her.
Hearing that's a huge step forward for me.
％Ｂ
「I've been... looking forward to going to the old school building every day too. I went to go see you every day... as if it were natural.」

Touko
「You're too close...! You getting closer to me... scares me...!」

％Ｂ
「There's no reason to be scared, is there? I...」
Touko
「No! I don't want to hear any more!」
I remember what Narusawa said.
What's important... is that I support Yukimura.
Yukimura's had to say goodbye over and over after all her transferring.
I think I understand how she feels at least to some extent, since I have similar experiences.

％Ｂ
「It'll be okay. I'll always be with you.」
Touko
「You don't... You don't know that for sure, do you!? There's no end to the ways we could end up separated!」

％Ｂ
「But that doesn't mean we wouldn't be able to see each other. We can see each other no matter where we are, if we put our minds to it.」

Touko
「Hgh... I've heard that so many times already! But I've still always been alone... Nothing changes if I'm not around...! I don't want to feel that way anymore!」


If goodbye is inevitable... then you should just never become deeply involved in the first place.
That way, you won't feel pain, sadness... or the loss from being separated.

Touko
「So don't... come any closer to me. Just leave me alone!」

％Ｂ
「No. You saying that's only gonna make me care about you more.」
I can't pull back.
I've already gotten this far. I don't think she'll open up to me unless I capture her, even if it's by force.

"I wish to have courage."
For both myself and for Yukimura.
If I have courage and take a step forward... I'm sure our relationship would change.

％Ｂ
「Can't you believe in how I feel about you? It doesn't have to be all at once... But I want you to consider me.」

Touko
「How am I supposed to believe!? You can't tell me to believe in something I can't see... It's not that easy!」

％Ｂ
「You're right. I don't think it'll be easy. But... the only thing I can do right now is be honest about telling you how I feel.」

Touko
「...」
％Ｂ
「I'll tell you over and over until you believe. I like you, Yukimura.」

％Ｂ
「The way you smile like you're playing a joke on me, the way you have so much fun playing with stray cats... I like everything about you. I care about you more than anyone else, and I just can't leave you alone.」


％Ｂ
「I... only feel this way about you. That's why... I want to keep seeing you smile from now on.」

I pack all of my feelings into those words.
A wind tinged with summer blows past us, cooling the heat from my confession just a little.

Touko
「...Sigh. Things have gotten so troublesome. I can't believe you're causing me this much trouble... You better take responsibility, okay?」

％Ｂ
「Wha...?」
Touko
「I've never met a boy as persistent as you. Coming to see me day after day after day.」

％Ｂ
「It was for the event committee at first, but... at some point that just became an excuse to come see you.」

Touko
「And then you suddenly said you liked me... I thought you were just messing with me, but then you said you were serious.」

％Ｂ
「I was pretty serious about that, you know. You're the one who was teasing me about it.」

Touko
「I... didn't know what to say back then. I didn't know... how I should respond to your feelings.」


％Ｂ
「...So you've been thinking about it since then?」
Touko
「Of course. That was... the first time a boy's said he liked me that seriously, you know.」

Yukimura's cute when she blushes like that.
Though I bet I'm bright red from embarrassment too.
Touko
「There's never been anyone... who's gotten this close to me. Especially a boy... I just kind of got scared.」

I think about the time we've spent in the old school building.
She really was thinking about me properly. Joy wells up in my heart.

Touko
「But... I can't. I've... been thinking this whole time about how this needs to end.」

％Ｂ
「Wha...?」
Touko
「You see, my next move is probably going to be decided soon. So... the time we can be together is already limited.」

％Ｂ
「Your next...!? You mean you're gonna go somewhere far away!?」
Touko
「That's right. That's why I can't accept your confession. It has nothing to do with my feelings... It's outside of our control.」

...I can't let myself freeze up in shock.
If I give up here, then this is just going to be exactly the same as all the goodbyes Yukimura's already experienced up until now.

I think back hard on Yukimura's expression and her words.
I'm going to confirm just one last thing, and then take my final step forward.
％Ｂ
「...You're not moving tomorrow or anything, right?」
Touko
「No, it isn't that soon. But... I think I might be gone by the time fall comes.」

％Ｂ
「Then there's still time. I'm not giving up.」

Touko
「...Didn't you hear what I just said? I'm not going to be here anymore.」

％Ｂ
「I heard you. I understand what you said, and that's my response.」
Touko
「There are other girls you're friends with, aren't there? So then... why me?」

％Ｂ
「Who knows. I didn't even realize I liked you until it was too late, and now I can't give up anymore. Do I need any more of a reason?」


Touko
「I... don't understand with a reason that vague. It needs to be more clearly defined, or else... I won't understand.」

％Ｂ
「I can define it starting now. I want to define it together... by spending time with you.」

Touko
「...You really do say unfair things, you know that?」
％Ｂ
「I'll make this a summer you'll never forget. So could you... give me your time for this summer?」

Touko
「...Sigh. You won't give up no matter what?」
Her smile looks exasperated, but also just a bit happy.
I burn that smile clearly into my heart.

Touko
「Wishes... are something you make on Tanabata, aren't they? So then... it's still too early to make a wish right now, isn't it?」

Touko
「The school's Tanabata Festival. I'll make a wish then... So could you wait until then?」

％Ｂ
「...You mean your answer's not a yes or no?」
Touko
「I still don't really know how I feel myself... so I want a little time. I'll be together with you until then.」


There's a little more than a month until Shionagi Academy's Tanabata Festival.
I still have a chance.
If I can get Yukimura to like me back properly by then, then that'll be that.

We may have a limited amount of time, but I won't rush.
I'll just slowly close the distance between the two of us, bit by bit.
％Ｂ
「Okay. That's fine. I'll do my best so you can give a proper answer. Let's get along.」


Touko
「...Mhm.」
I grip her hand a little strongly.
She's gripping back strongly too. It doesn't look like my confession's had a negative effect, at least.

Touko
「Hey... Are you free tomorrow?」
％Ｂ
「Huh? Yeah, I don't have any plans...」
Touko
「Then... I want a do-over of our date yesterday. I want to go on a date... together with you, with the proper feelings.」

％Ｂ
「...Of course we can. There's nothing I want more than to be together with you tomorrow too.」

all
I'll do things my way, and she'll do things her way.
Let's start by both facing the same direction, and move forward together.
