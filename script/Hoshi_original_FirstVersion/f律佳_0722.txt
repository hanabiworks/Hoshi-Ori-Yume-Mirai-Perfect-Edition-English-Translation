Rikka's response last night was...
『Thinking about telling my family is a bit embarrassing, but I'll let you handle it.』

『Thinking about telling my family is a bit embarrassing, but I'll let you handle it.』

I get how she feels.
Just imagining talking to my family about my love life makes me feel itchy.
We decide to hold off for now, and decide to switch our meet-up place from Rikka's house to the crossroads near her building.

...But.
Meguru
「Good morning!」
％Ｂ
「G-Good morning...」
Why might Meguru-san be here?
Rikka looks at me apologetically as I stumble for words before her bright and cheery greeting.


Rikka
「She apparently more or less figured it out yesterday.」
Meguru
「It's because he called you Rikka, and you two just talked like you were dating.」

Meguru
「So you are dating Onee-chan, right?」
％Ｂ
「Oh, yeah. I am.」
Meguru
「Got it! So you're Onee-chan's first ever boyfriend. Fufu～ Really now～♪」

Rikka
「Meguru. It's rude to stare.」
Meguru
「Oh, please excuse me. I just got emotional knowing that he was your boyfriend.」

％Ｂ
「I don't mind.」
Meguru
「Ehe, you're so nice! It looks like you've found a wonderful boyfriend, Onee-chan.」

Rikka
「Wha... You're bringing me into the conversation now?」
Meguru
「Hehe, you're blushing. Well, Onee-chan?」
Rikka
「Ah, uuh... He's... a very wonderful boyfriend.」
Rikka looks overwhelmed.
all
Meguru
「Please call me Meguru. Since Onee-chan's a "Narusawa" too.」

％Ｂ
「Meguru-san?」
Meguru
「Mmm～ ...I don't really mind that, but I think "-san" might be a bit too formal since I'm younger...」

Meguru
「You're Onee-chan's boyfriend, so I'd be happy if you could be more familiar with me.」

％Ｂ
「I'll call you Meguru-chan, then.」
Meguru
「Okay. Please call me that, then. And I'll call you...?」
％Ｂ
「You can call me whatever you want.」
Meguru
「Onii-san?」
％Ｂ
「Bffh!」

Rikka
「Wh-Wha, Meguru!?」
Meguru
「...Would be jumping the gun a bit, wouldn't it? Oh, may I call you Hino-senpai?」
Meguru
「...Would be jumping the gun a bit, would't it? Oh, may I call you Senpai?」
Meguru
「I've always wanted to call someone that, since I haven't gotten to go to school that much in Japan.」

％Ｂ
「That's fine.」
Meguru
「Thank you very much. I hope we can be good friends, Senpai.」
all
Rikka
「Ryousuke, you look far too happy. It's gross.」
Rikka
「You look far too happy. It's gross.」
％Ｂ
「I can't help it! There haven't been any girls who've called me Senpai until now!」

Rikka
「You want to be called Senpai that badly?」
％Ｂ
「It's every guy's dream to be called that at least once.」
Rikka
「Boys really are strange. Or maybe it's just that you have peculiar fetishes... Let's get going, Pervert-senpai.」

％Ｂ
「Okay...」

Meguru
「Have a good day, Onee-chan, Senpai! I'll be coming by for my meeting a little after noon.」

Rikka
「Okay. We'll be waiting. We're going.」
％Ｂ
「See you.」
all
Meguru-chan waves at us as we go.
all
We turn the corner so we can't see her anymore.
Rikka links arms with me.
Rikka
「Mmh... You were acting all happy because of Meguru. What part of being called Senpai's so great anyway... I can't understand it.」

％Ｂ
「Men are much simpler creatures than you think they are, Rikka.」
I pet her head.
Rikka
「Oh... Hehehe～ ...Ehehe～♪」
She closes her eyes happily and sticks even closer.
Rikka
「And girls might be much simpler creatures than you think too.」

We've got another busy day of preparing for the Tanabata Festival ahead of us.
all
Meguru showed up at school after twelve o'clock.
Ishizuka-senpai and I are sitting in on the meeting.
Meguru
「Chopin's Prelude No. 15 and Piano Sonata No. 2, Badarzerska's Maiden's Prayer, Liszt's La Campanella and Liebesträume No. 3.」
Meguru
「It's the same as we agreed upon over mail, so there are no issues.」
Chopin's pieces are Meguru's specialty among her performance repertoire. She won first place and the soloist award at a Chopin-themed international Asia contest.
She also recorded those pieces for her first album that released last month.
People call Chopin the poet of piano playing.
He's well known for his lyrical melodies, but his sonatas also showcase his irregular, forceful, and passionate side.
He was an introvert who disliked being out in public. His compositions might have just been the way he expressed himself instead.

The emotion... The heart that the genius Chopin packed into those compositions is incredibly difficult to understand...

And Meguru's the only person I know who can express those inner subtleties with the ease she does.
It must be one genius understanding another. It's a performance I couldn't mimic.

And that is the stark difference between a genius and a normal person.
I've been listening to that difference ever since I was young.
Meguru
「I apologize in my mother's stead for her not being able to participate, despite being invited every year. It seems she's again busy with the music festival...」

Ishizuka
「We're already grateful beyond words that you are participating, Meguru-san.」

Ishizuka
「I have heard the Salzburg music festival is quite the sight, and many music lovers all over the world go.」

Meguru
「Yes, that's true. The city is already notable for its music, but the five weeks of that festival are very special. Plazas, streets, churches, theaters... The city overflows with music of all genres no matter the place.」
Meguru
「It's as if the entire world has been enveloped in music.」
Ishizuka
「Wow～ That sounds so nice～ I'd love to go at least once.」
Meguru
「Yes, please do. The music is one thing, but the shores of Salzkammergut are also very beautiful. I highly recommend going.」
Meguru
「I especially like Ebensee and Hallstatt. They're within a three-hour train or bus ride, and they're both very scenic and relaxing places.」

Ishizuka
「I will be sure to go there on vacation after graduating. But was it okay for you to not participate in the festival, Meguru-san?」

Meguru
「I did already play a bit before coming back to Japan. I had offers for work in Japan, and I also had personal reasons for wanting to come back.」

She looks at me and smiles.
And I smile back at her.
Ishizuka watches our exchange, and her expression changes to that of an epiphany.
Ishizuka
「Narusawa-san, you're also very good at piano. Perhaps you two could do a duet or four hands performance as sisters? I'm sure it would get people talking.」

Meguru
「Onee-chan and me...?」
She sounds surprised and happy.
...And in comparison, I'm taken aback.
Performing with Meguru...
...Someone like me...
Meguru
「Mamaaa! How do I play this part?」
Sayaka
「That part's a little difficult. Can you do it, Meguru?」
Meguru
「I'll do my best! Because I'm definitely going to learn to play like Onee-chan!」

Rikka
「...」
Sayaka
「Rikka?」
Rikka
「Oh... I-I'd like it if you could teach me that part too. I want to review it together with Meguru.」

Rikka
「But there isn't enough time to adjust the program at this point...」
Ishizuka
「We don't need to worry about that. We always make sure to have some extra time at the beginning and end of the fest when we plan things.」

Ishizuka
「There'll be enough time for one piece if we shorten those intervals a bit. Those parts are usually a bit boring since it's just talking, so I was thinking we should do something else anyway.」

Ishizuka
「I'm very sorry to request this of a guest, but would it be possible to ask you to play one more piece?」


Meguru
「Yes. I would love to.」
Ishizuka
「Really!? Thank you very much! What about you, Narusawa-san!?」
Rikka
「I... I'm sorry. Please let me think this over for a bit.」
Meguru
「Oh...」
Rikka
「I don't know if I'll be able to set aside enough time to practice with my committee work. I wouldn't want to let the quality of my work fall by the wayside for this, so...」

Ishizuka
「If that's what you're worried about, then we can reallocate the work and assign a portion of your work to the others.」

Rikka
「But I would still feel bad, and I would personally like to devote my efforts to the committee. Let's discuss this again at a later time, if I find myself with enough time. And if I don't, I will let you know as soon as I can.」
Ishizuka
「...If you think so, then I won't force you. Think about it, okay? And so would that work for you too, Meguru-san?」

Meguru
「Yes. It would depend on the piece we play, but it should be fine if it's one I already know.」

Ishizuka
「Thank you very much. I'm very much looking forward to working with you on the day of.」
That's the end of the meeting.
Meguru
「...」
Meguru stands up from her seat. She looks very sad.
An instinctual part of me, a part of me I can't even begin to reason with, tightens around me.
It constricts my emotions.
I love Meguru... I love her so much, but...
I...
I can't look Meguru in the eye.
Rikka and I are walking along together after getting some materials from the student council.
Rikka came to help out again after she finished with her work with the concert team.

But she's acting strangely.
Not in the same way as yesterday, with her period.
She seems the same as usual, but she seems kind of down...
％Ｂ
「Something wrong?」
Rikka
「What?」
％Ｂ
「You just seem kinda depressed.」
Rikka
「Was I making a face like that?」
％Ｂ
「I guess it's more like your mood than your face.」
Rikka
「...Hehe. I can't hide anything from you, can I?」
It's almost been a month since Rikka and I started dating.
We're together almost every day. I've started to pick up on a lot of things.
And judging by how she doesn't try to deny anything, it looks like I was right.
％Ｂ
「You can talk to me.」
Rikka
「I want to think about this on my own for a bit. I haven't really organized how I feel about this myself yet...」

％Ｂ
「All right. But feel free to talk to me whenever you want, if I can help.」
Rikka
「Okay. Thanks.」
If she wants to think about it on her own, then I should let her.
If she still can't solve whatever it is, or she looks like she's having trouble, then I can just offer my aid again.

I transfer what I'm carrying into one hand and use the other to pet Rikka on the head.
Rikka
「Hyah! ...What's this for?」
％Ｂ
「I felt like petting you. Plus, your hair smells really nice when I do this.」

％Ｂ
「I like how your hair smells.」
Rikka
「Geez... You're such a freak.」
She says that, but she brings herself closer and smiles.
We slowly walk to the second chemistry classroom.
all
Sora
「...For you two.」
She holds out some homemade-looking phone straps with spheres attached to them.

The spheres are all different designs and sizes.
They look familiar.
％Ｂ
「It's the solar system.」
Sora
「...*nod* Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune, Uranus.」


Misa
「Sora-san and I made them. We wished to do something to thank all of you for helping the two of us this whole time.」
Misa
「We discussed what we should do, and we were inspired by the Shionagi Friends idea to create an easy-to-understand series of celestial bodies!」

％Ｂ
「Oh, I see. They're very well made.」
They're shaped nicely, painted neatly, and they've even been varnished.
％Ｂ
「But they're all different sizes.」
all
Sora
「...Hgh!」
％Ｂ
「Wha!? Sorry! I didn't know that'd hurt you so much!」

Sora
「...I wanted to make the sizes even more different. But Misa stopped me.」

％Ｂ
「What's that supposed to mean?」

Misa
「Sora-san apparently wished to make all of the planets to scale with the Earth one. But that would mean that Jupiter would be over eleven times larger...」
Misa
「It would be inconvenient for use as a strap if it were too large, so as unfortunate as it is, I had her forgo the idea.」

So the sizes are this disparate even after that...
Jupiter and Saturn are way too big.
Sora
「...I couldn't lie to myself any more than I already did.」
％Ｂ
「I get it! I really get it! You did a good job, Ousaka!」
all
Touko
「By the way, some are already claimed. I'm Jupiter～」
％Ｂ
「Well, if you're fine with that... but are you sure?」
Touko
「Why wouldn't I be? Don't you think it's really big and cute?」
％Ｂ
「All right. That's fine, then.」
Yukimura picked the one I wanted least.
all
Natsuki
「Mine's the scorching hot planet of passion, Mars!」
％Ｂ
「You're just saying that 'cause it's red.」
I'm pretty sure Mars is supposed to mostly be below freezing temperatures.
all
Marika
「I'm Uranus, Okihara-san is Neptune, and Ousaka-san is Saturn.」
％Ｂ
「You guys all decided already?」
all
Sora
「This is you, Ryou.」
Sora
「This is you.」
Ousaka pulls one out separately from the planets...
％Ｂ
「Oh. Is this the Sun?」
It's the radiant center of the solar system.
I'm a little worried if it's okay for me to get one this majestic, but if Ousaka pulled this one out separately, then she must have made this one specifically for me.


％Ｂ
「Thanks. I'll put this to use right away.」
I attach it to my phone.
Sora
「This one suits you, Ritsu.」

She turns to Rikka, who had been standing silently beside me, and shows her a strap with an orangish sphere on it.

Sora
「Venus... The goddess of love and beauty.」
Rikka
「...I haven't been able to help you all that much. Are you sure it's okay for me to have this?」

Sora
「*nod* Because you're a member of the Shionagi Friends too, Ritsu.」
Rikka
「Th-Thank you...」
She hesitantly accepts the Venus strap from Ousaka.
I hope this cheers her up a bit...
I can't really tell from her expression, but she does attach the strap to her phone.

all
％Ｂ
「Wait, so then who's Earth and Mercury?」
Sora
「...Currently searching.」
％Ｂ
「Well... I guess the last of the allies usually do show up in times of trouble.」

Sora
「...*nod*」
So we'll leave those seats open for when that happens.
％Ｂ
「Thanks, Ousaka. And thank you too, Okihara-senpai.」
Misa
「I'm very happy that you like them.」
Sora
「I hope you treasure them.」
％Ｂ
「I'll always keep it on my phone.」
all
This is pretty nice.
It's like we've all bonded this way.
The Sun shines magnificently in my hand.
