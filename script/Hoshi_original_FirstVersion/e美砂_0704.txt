The next day.
Shuuichi
「Now then, let's begin today's meeting!」
It's finally time for the before-finals event committee meeting.
Shuuichi
「Err, as you all know, finals are coming up! The committee will go on hiatus during the exam period. After that, we will begin preparing for the Tanabata Festival in earnest...」


Shuuichi
「And so, I think we should decide on everything that needs to be decided on today.」

all
Looking at Shuuichi's words another way...
This meeting's gonna be our last chance to get permission for the naturalist club to use the old school building.

Yamashita-sensei's here again, which means that Shuuichi must see it that way too.

And of course, I have every intention of succeeding.
I've asked Okihara-senpai to attend again today for that reason.
Misa
「...」
all
We're gonna convince everyone here to let us use the old school building by the time this meeting ends.
No matter what!
Natsuki
「Now then... It's finally time.」
Marika
「Uuh... I wonder if it's going to be okay～」
％Ｂ
「Yeah... I'm just gonna do as much as I possibly can.」

Misa
「Thank you very much.」
％Ｂ
「You can count on me.」
all
All that's left is to see just how far I can get.
Shuuichi
「...And so, the student council has asked that we pay greater attention this year to the management of our venues. They ask that each of us keep it in mind.」


Shuuichi
「Err, and lastly, I'd like for us to continue discussing the matter of the naturalist club using the old school building.」

all
Marika
「It's finally time...」
％Ｂ
「Yeah... Finally.」

Natsuki
「You better make yourself look cool.」
％Ｂ
「I will.」
all
I look at Okihara-senpai.
Misa
「...
Ryousuke-san
Auh
.」
％Ｂ
「It'll be fine.」
I give a gentle nod to her worried expression.
all
％Ｂ
「I would like to restate my opinions on this matter!」
I raise my hand and speak in a loud, clear voice.
Shuuichi
「Would that be okay with you, Yamashita-sensei?」
Yamashita-sensei
「...Let's hear it.」
％Ｂ
「Thank you very much.」
all
I stand up and take a heavy stack of materials out from my bag.

Yamashita-sensei
「Hoh.」
There's a lot of stuff in here that I don't need since I've already memorized it... but this is just another part of my plan.

This stack of papers will serve as an indicator of just how much research I've done.
％Ｂ
「There was previously a detracting opinion regarding our request to use the old school building. That there may not be many people who would be interested in going to an aquarium in the first place.」


％Ｂ
「And Marinpia Shionagi, which closed down in May this year, was brought up as an example.」

Event Committee Member D
「...」
％Ｂ
「And that would indeed be an understandable opinion. The general public is aware that the reason for Marinpia Shionagi's closure was due to a lack of interest stemming from a deterioration in quality.」


％Ｂ
「In order to begin our discussion of usage rights to the old school building―」
％Ｂ
「I would like to first clear up this misconception.」
Misa
「...Misconception?」
all
％Ｂ
「I have here some materials.」
I hold a flipbook up over my head. I've placed scaled-up copies of figures from the books I borrowed from the library inside.

I made this last night.
It came out pretty nicely, if I do say so myself.
Making these kinds of things is actually my specialty.
％Ｂ
「This is a graph displaying Marinpia Shionagi's attendance counts over time.」
Event Committee Member A
「It's nice that you have a graph, but...」
The committee members are all wearing awkward smiles.
Event Committee Member B
「But it seems like the number of customers actually did go down over time.」
That's right. The graph I've readied shows a gentle downward slope.
％Ｂ
「Yes. Marinpia Shionagi's attendance count did indeed decrease over time. That much is undeniable.」

Event Committee Member C
「...So then it did close down because of a lack of interest, didn't it?」
％Ｂ
「That might be your conclusion after seeing only this graph. But what if we compare this to similar plots from other aquariums? Such as in this graph.」


I flip a page.
％Ｂ
「I have here a comparison of Marinpia's attendance counts and the same statistic from five other aquariums of similar scale. It should be evident that the downward slopes of all five other aquariums is much steeper than Marinpia's.」


％Ｂ
「We can infer from these two graphs that attendance counts for aquariums decreased nationwide. One can imagine this to be an effect stemming from changes in the economy, declining birth rates, and other lifestyle factors.」


Event Committee Member A
「But... Marinpia Shionagi's attendance counts didn't go down as much as the other aquariums...」

％Ｂ
「That would be my point exactly!」
Event Committee Member A
「...!?」
％Ｂ
「In comparison to the rapid decrease in attendance counts shown at other institutions, Marinpia's decline is remarkably slow.」

％Ｂ
「One can see from these graphs that, despite a steep decline in aquarium attendance nationwide, Marinpia was able to stand firm and significantly reduce its losses in attendance.」


％Ｂ
「To further prove this point, Marinpia's official website still has guests commenting on how they regret the aquarium's closure. There is no end to the voices that wish for it to be reopened.」


Misa
「Oh...」
all
％Ｂ
「I have readied copies of just a few of these comments here. Can you still say that Marinpia was unpopular after seeing these?」

％Ｂ
「In fact... I believe it wouldn't be exaggerating to say that Marinpia Shionagi was an incredibly popular aquarium on the national scale.」

Natsuki
「Fufun, not bad.」
％Ｂ
「But then why did such a popular aquarium close down? It is generally understood that there was an extended period of losses in its business due to a deterioration in quality. Unfortunately, that is the truth.」


％Ｂ
「However, the reason for its losses is not due to a decrease in attendance.」

Yamashita-sensei
「Hoh.」
％Ｂ
「The real reason is clear once Marinpia Shionagi's expenditures are examined. Marinpia's expenditures are clearly higher than those of the other institutions, especially relative to its profits. It was managed in a way that made it prone to losses.」


％Ｂ
「It was able to make profits back when the economy was better due to the number of attendees... but the situation reversed completely over these last few years.」


％Ｂ
「And that can be largely traced back to the fact that the parent organization that managed Marinpia is a nonprofit organization.」

I hold up my next set of materials.
％Ｂ
「This is a registry of Marinpia's directors and staff at the time. There are about forty names written here.」

％Ｂ
「Forty employees for one aquarium. This would be close to two to three times the number employed by other aquariums.」

％Ｂ
「This would be just one example of how Marinpia Shionagi's expenditures were extremely large in comparison to other institutions of similar size. How might this have happened?」

％Ｂ
「That would be because Marinpia Shionagi was used for retirement positions by civic officials and educators. This would result in an environment that offered little in the way of knowledge pertaining to typical business costs.」


Marika
「Wh-What～ ...Really...」
all
That's right... This is the truth behind Marinpia's closure that I heard from Azuma-san.
According to him, Marinpia's construction was fraught with financial issues from the beginning.
Azuma-san said that his work for them ended up being pretty much for free as a result.

And the reason he still accepted the job was because, in addition to his own pride as an architect, he could feel the curator's passion as a marine scientist, one Professor Okihara... And that's the gist of the story.


Azuma-san talked to Okihara-san's parents over and over to do whatever they could to design as much in the way of facilities as possible with what little budget they had.

But their efforts completely backfired.
Their planning went so well that the staff became complacent, and didn't attempt to improve the aquarium any further.

％Ｂ
「There would also be the issue of operating costs. Due to its status as a nonprofit organization, Marinpia's investments in its facilities were severely delayed.」


％Ｂ
「As an example, the filtration units. Using the newest models would have significantly curbed operating costs, but Marinpia refused to invest in their higher upfront prices, causing them to spend more money in the long run.」


％Ｂ
「That would be just one of the reasons that caused Marinpia's deterioration in quality.」
％Ｂ
「―And so to summarize. Marinpia Shionagi did not close down because of a lack of public interest.」


％Ｂ
「And thus it would follow that Shionagi City still has a sizeable population of people that are still interested in aquariums and are eagerly awaiting to appreciate them.」


Misa
「...
Ryousuke-san
Ahh
...」
all
Yamashita-sensei
「...I see. I understand very well the real reason behind Marinpia Shionagi's closure.」

Yamashita-sensei
「But don't you think that's a different matter from getting permission to use the old school building?」

％Ｂ
「...」
Yamashita-sensei
「You're right that there may be a large number of people who regret Marinpia's closure.」

Yamashita-sensei
「But since it isn't guaranteed that those people would all come to see the naturalist club's aquarium, I don't believe that constitutes a reason to allow you to use the old school building... What do you think?」


Marika
「That's...」
％Ｂ
「...Yes, that's true. It may be as you say, Yamashita-sensei.」
Natsuki
「Wha... You're agreeing with him!?」
Misa
「...」
all
％Ｂ
「But, I thought you might say that... and so I took the liberty of carrying out a survey.」

Yamashita-sensei
「...A survey?」
％Ｂ
「Please look at this.」
I hold out a sheaf of papers to him.
％Ｂ
「These are responses to a survey I asked several grade school teachers to take.」

％Ｂ
「The survey asks the following questions: "Was Marinpia Shionagi useful for educational purposes?"」

％Ｂ
「And, "If we were to create an aquarium for our school's Tanabata Festival, would you recommend your students to come see it?"」

Yamashita-sensei
「You... had grade school faculty members take these?」
％Ｂ
「Yes, I did. I asked my homeroom teacher from back when I used to go to school here to help me.」


Marika
「Oh... So that's why you asked about Miyazawa-sensei?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. He remembered me... and he actually faxed these out to other schools to help me out.」


％Ｂ
「Thanks to him, I was able to get responses from nearly one hundred teachers.」

Misa
「This many teachers helped...?」
％Ｂ
「It just speaks to how many teachers thought positively of Marinpia.」

％Ｂ
「And over 90 percent of teachers responded that Marinpia Shionagi had a large impact on their students' educations.」


all
Yamashita-sensei
「Yes... It seems they did. They say the aquarium was the best possible location for instilling respect for life, a wonder for ecological sciences, and stimulating their intellectual curiosity...」


Marika
「Woooow～! They loved it, Okihara-san!」
Misa
「...」
Marika
「Okihara-san?」
all
Yamashita-sensei
「And it says they would love to recommend the children to come to the aquarium if one were to be done for the Tanabata Festival.」

％Ｂ
「And in this way, we can expect a very large number of children to come to our display on the day of the Tanabata Festival.」

％Ｂ
「We believe it would be ideal to use one of the larger classrooms in the old school building instead of the cramped second chemistry classroom―」

Misa
「E-Excuse me!」
Okihara-senpai suddenly stands bolt upright.
Misa
「As the president of the naturalist club, I would like to make this request of everyone present once again!」

％Ｂ
「Senpai...?」
Misa
「Please, if you could allow us to use the old school building for the purpose of the naturalist club's display...!」

Misa
「I would like to create an opportunity for the people who live in Shionagi to learn about Shionagi's ocean, to make contact with it...!」

Natsuki
「Misa-san...」
Misa
「I saw a dream within Marinpia Shionagi. It was a very majestic dream of the ocean. I want to communicate those wonders to others, even if it's just slightly!」


all
She bows her head deeply.
％Ｂ
「We would also like to request permission!」
Marika
「Please!」
all
Shinozaki and I follow suit and bow our heads.
Yamashita-sensei
「Hm...」
We've done what we can.
It's all up to what the people here decide.
Shuuichi
「Then let's put it to a vote.」
Shuuichi
「Those of us who are in favor of allowing the naturalist club to use the old school building, please raise your hands.」

all
％Ｂ
「...Come on!」
Misa
「Sniff... Hgh... Uuhh...」
％Ｂ
「U-Um... Okihara-senpai?」
Misa
「Hic... Sniff...gh... I...I'm... sorry... Sniff...」
％Ｂ
「No, it's okay...」
Misa
「I just... didn't think... things would turn out that way... and I'm... just... Sniff...」

％Ｂ
「Yes... That's true...」
Misa
「I just... I just couldn't believe so many people were in favor... I was... just so happy... Sniff...!」

％Ｂ
「We did get a unanimous approval, didn't we?」
Incredibly enough, the results of the vote were that every single person in the audience, Yamashita-sensei included, were in favor of us using the old school building.

Misa
「It's... all thanks to you
, Ryousuke-san

... Thank you... so very much... Sniff...」

％Ｂ
「Oh no, I feel like your final statement was the final blow.」

Misa
「No... It's because you did so much
, Ryousuke-san

... You gathered all of those materials...」

％Ｂ
「That isn't that big of a deal.」
Misa
「And... seeing you defend Marinpia to that extent... It made me... so... so genuinely happy... Uuuh...」

％Ｂ
「I-I'm very glad to hear that. Um, maybe you should wipe your tears...」

Misa
「Ye...Yes... Sniff... I apologize... I'm rather overcome with emotion...」
She wipes at her eyes with a handkerchief and finally stops crying.
Misa
「Please allow me to thank you once again. Thank you so very much, on behalf of the naturalist club, and Marinpia Shionagi.」


She bows her head deeply.
％Ｂ
「Please stop. I didn't do all that because I wanted you to thank me like this.」

％Ｂ
「It's because... I was bitter.」
Misa
「What? ...You were bitter?」
％Ｂ
「I was so bitter when I saw you crying after the last meeting. I couldn't cheer you up... and I couldn't forgive myself for that.」

％Ｂ
「I wanted you to smile, no matter what. And so that's why I...」

Misa
「It was... for my smile?」
％Ｂ
「Well, yes... To be honest, I think that might've been my main reason, instead of the naturalist club or Marinpia and stuff...」


Misa
「...」
％Ｂ
「Oh, but... actually, was that rude of me to say? I just, um... wanted―」

％Ｂ
「Whoa!?」
She suddenly hugs me tightly.
％Ｂ
「Wha!? S-Se-Se-Se-Senpai!?」
My heart thunders in my chest as she hugs me tightly.

％Ｂ
「U-Um―」
Misa
「Thank you very much... I'm very... very happy.」

％Ｂ
「S-Sure...」
I know she has a habit of hugging people when she's happy.
But this feels even more intense than usual...
Misa
「I can't say it enough... Thank you so very much... This made me so happy...」

％Ｂ
「O-Oh, no... I'm glad, but...」
When she presses her breasts against me like that... it's... I dunno...
％Ｂ
「Uhh... Thank you very much from me, too.」
Misa
「What?」
％Ｂ
「Oh, uh... N-No, I meant, I'm sorry.」

Misa
「...Why are you apologizing?」
％Ｂ
「Because... I didn't discuss with you beforehand about why Marinpia closed down.」

Okihara-senpai had thought that Marinpia had closed down because of a lack of interest, just like everyone else.

Misa
「My parents often had complaints along those lines. But neither of them are particularly the sort to discuss things like that...」


They probably didn't want her to have any unnecessary worries.
Not like there's any point in holding any grudges against them, though.
And it was true that the attendance counts decreased...
Misa
「...Thank goodness.」
％Ｂ
「Huh? ...Thank goodness?」
Misa
「Yes... Because this means that Marinpia didn't close down because everyone became tired of it and disliked it.」

％Ｂ
「Oh...」
Misa
「I thought it was due to a lack of interest, but it closed amidst many regrets, and there are still people who wish for it to reopen... I was very happy to learn that.」


Misa
「It's unfortunate that it closed down, of course. But as long as there are still people who loved Marinpia, I think it may be able to reopen someday...」


Misa
「Or at least, I believe so.」
％Ｂ
「I'm sure it'll happen... I'm sure you can do it.」
I gently pull away from her and firmly grasp her shoulders.

％Ｂ
「I didn't say it at that meeting, but there are several institutions that still have a significant number of attendees in the current state of the economy.」

％Ｂ
「Okinawa, Asahikawa, Toba, Kyoto, Osaka, Tokyo's Sumida...」


％Ｂ
「The aquariums and zoos in those cities all have been increasing their attendance counts these last few years.」
Misa
「Indeed... I have heard of this, yes.」
％Ｂ
「Those institutions all have their own unique characters that you can't experience anywhere else.」

％Ｂ
「For example, Okinawa has the largest water tank in the world, and its displays make ample use of the local geography and natural light.」

％Ｂ
「Asahikawa has its ecological-behavior exhibits, and Toba advertises the sheer number of the animals displayed.」

％Ｂ
「These aquariums with their own unique features have been able to steadily increase their attendances. In contrast―」

Misa
「You're saying Marinpia Shionagi didn't have that.」
％Ｂ
「Yes... It seems so. As unfortunate as it is.」

％Ｂ
「But, I'm sure that you would be able to make an aquarium like that someday. An aquarium that you could only find in Shionagi, with its own personal charm.」


Misa
「Oh...」
Okihara-senpai can create another aquarium in this town.
I believe―
Misa
「Thank you very much!」
％Ｂ
「Gh!?」
Sh-She's hugging me again...
Misa
「I will do my best! So I can live fulfill expectations someday

, Ryousuke-san

!」
She smiles radiantly.
％Ｂ
「Y-Yes... Um... That's great, but...」
Breasts... again...
％Ｂ
「Hahhh～」
I heave a sigh in front of my desk.
％Ｂ
「...Not good.」
Today's the start of the weekend.
Finals start on Monday.
And yet―
％Ｂ
「I haven't studied at all... Hahaha...」
I know I shouldn't be laughing.
But... what else is there for me to do?
％Ｂ
「If I fail and have to take supplementary lessons after finally getting permission to use the old school building...」

Now that'd really be no laughing matter.
％Ｂ
「I guess I should just do as much as I can...」
％Ｂ
「Hm? From Okihara-senpai?」
【Misa】「Thank you so, so very #Nmuch for today.」
【Misa】「I'm sorry for the #Nmessage. I simply #Ncannot thank you nearly #Nenough.」
％Ｂ
「Haha... All this thanking and apologizing. Busy busy.」
【％Ｂ】「You're very welcome. #NThere's no need to #Napologize.」
【Misa】「Yes, thank you very #Nmuch. Good luck with #Nstudying for finals. #NLet's begin working #Nhard together again #Nafter exams.」
【％Ｂ】「Likewise! As long as I #Ndon't fail, at least...」
【Misa】「Is... studying not #Ngoing well?」
【％Ｂ】「Yes, well... To be #Nhonest, things might be #Nlooking pretty bad... #NHaha...」
％Ｂ
「...Maybe I didn't need to actually tell her the truth?」
It's Okihara-senpai we're talking about. What if she calls me or something because she's worried...?
％Ｂ
「...Yeah, right.」
％Ｂ
「Aaagh!?」
Okihara-senpai's name is on the screen.
％Ｂ
「Sh-She's actually calling me...」
_smh_st_02

_smh_st_btn05
％Ｂ
「H-Hello?」
Misa
『Good evening. This is Misa.』
％Ｂ
「H-Hello... This is ％Ｂ.」
...Wait. She already knows who I am.
Misa
『Um... Are things really not looking good?』
％Ｂ
「Huh? Oh, um... well... not really, no.」
...I told her the truth again.
Misa
『Perhaps I could help, if you're okay with it?』
％Ｂ
「Huh? ...Help how?」
Misa
『Would you like to study together?』
％Ｂ
「Uh...」
Study together with Okihara-senpai?
You mean...
％Ｂ
「Y-You mean studying together!? Just us two!?」
Misa
『Yes. Just the two of us.』
Seriously!?
Misa
『I would be able to teach you better that way... How does that sound?』
％Ｂ
「I-I'd love to!」
Getting to study together with Okihara-senpai, just the two of us―it'd be absolutely perfect!

Misa
『I understand. Then I will be coming over tomorrow!』
％Ｂ
「Y-You're going to come over to my house?」
Misa
『If that is inconvenient, perhaps another location―』
％Ｂ
「No, no, no! You're welcome to come! Please come!」
Misa
『I understand. I'll be there tomorrow at nine o'clock in the morning, then.』

That early!?
Misa
『We'd like as much time to study as possible, yes?』
％Ｂ
「Y-Yes, that's true... I would, yes...」
Misa
『Then I will see you tomorrow.』
％Ｂ
「Y-Yes... Thank you very much!」
