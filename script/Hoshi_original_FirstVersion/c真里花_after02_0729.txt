The two of us left work early to go to City Hall.
We had to submit the paperwork for moving, and the marriage registration forms.
％Ｂ
「You know, now that we've submitted those... That was kinda anticlimactic.」
Marika
「They probably get at least a few of those a day. But we got a big smile from the person in charge. "Congratulations on your marriage."」


％Ｂ
「That was pretty nice. It kinda brought it home for me.」

Marika
「...So now we're legally husband and wife, right?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, we are.」
Marika
「Hino Marika... So my last name's going to be different starting today...」
Marika
「...So my last name's going to be different starting today...」
We haven't had the ceremony yet. We've only turned in a form.
But now we're finally husband and wife...
Marika
「It still doesn't really feel real, but it kinda makes me blush～」
％Ｂ
「Right? But...」
I turn to face her.
％Ｂ
「Let's do our best together from now on too, Marika.」
Marika
「Oh, y-yes, likewise!」
all
Marika also turns toward me and bows her head.
％Ｂ
「Wait. It's weird to be this formal.」
Marika
「Ahaha, you're right～ Wanna go home, then? Back... to our house.」


％Ｂ
「Yeah... Wanna hold hands?」

Marika
「I do～ ...Ahaha... Look at the two of us.」
We hold hands tightly and start on the way home.
％Ｂ
「Phew... We've managed to tidy up the living room.」
Seems like we've got the absolute bare minimum in terms of living space prepared now.
Marika
「Sorry～ ...Our room isn't ready at all yet...」
％Ｂ
「That's no surprise, considering all the boxes we still have to unpack. Let's do it bit by bit until this weekend. We're both off then, so we can finish it up all at once.」


Marika
「We have lots of work to do. I'll clean up here and there too.」

Marika
「Want to take a quick break? I'll make some tea.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, the stove's already set up. I only just plugged the fridge in, though.」

Marika
「I bought ice at the convenience store, so we can chill the tea using that. Oh, umm, I need to find cups～」


all
She runs around all over the place to prepare the tea.
Marika
「Great work today. Here's some tea.」
She sets out some barley tea for the two of us after a bit.
％Ｂ
「Thanks... Wow, this is a cutesy cup.」
all
It's a plastic mug.
There's colorful Smileman art on it.
Marika
「S-Sorry. But I couldn't find the box with the dishes...」

％Ｂ
「Oh yeah, that's probably in the bedroom... I feel like it's buried pretty deep in there somewhere.」

Marika
「These just happened to be in a box I opened... So I thought I'd just use them.」

％Ｂ
「But still... I'm surprised you've got something like this, Marika.」
Marika
「Yeah, I just couldn't throw it away. I bought these back in grade school.」

％Ｂ
「Huh. Was that after I transferred?」
Marika
「Yeah. I think so. I saw them at a store and just fell in love...」

％Ｂ
「Really... I like 'em. Let's use these from now on.」

Marika
「What? But we're adults. Don't you think they're a little childish?」

％Ｂ
「It's fine if we don't mind it. I think I'll have my morning coffee in this from now on.」

Marika
「Wow～ ...I didn't expect them to be useful after all those years.」
Marika
「Hehe... That's great.」
She strokes a finger along the rim of the cup.
Smileman's smile matches nicely with Marika's own.
all
％Ｂ
「Phew...」
I feel like the tea tastes particularly good out of this cup.

％Ｂ
「Now then... We're gonna be living here, starting tomorrow...」
Marika
「Yeah. I-I wonder if we'll do okay～」
％Ｂ
「Hm? What, you worried?」
Marika
「Oh, no! It's totally okay! W-Wah～ ...I'm so excited～」

％Ｂ
「Seems like you're forcing it a bit...」
Marika
「Y-You think so?」
％Ｂ
「Tell me anything that's on your mind, all right? We're not unrelated anymore.」

Marika
「Oh, y-yeah, you're right... Because now... you're my husband.」

Marika
「Umm, actually, I... I've never lived on my own before, so...」

Marika
「I've studied up and practiced a lot, but... I was worried about doing housework properly and stuff. I just can't get rid of those doubts.」


％Ｂ
「Yeah... You've been living with your parents all this time, after all.」
all
I'm sure she's worried now that she's suddenly living away from them.
％Ｂ
「But there's nothing to worry about at all. Remember how you'd help out with lots of stuff at my old apartment? That was crazy helpful.」


％Ｂ
「Just doing it like that'd be perfect. If there's something we don't know, then we can just learn it as we go.」

％Ｂ
「And besides, we both have jobs. I'll help out with my fair share of the housework.」

Marika
「R-Really～? Ehehe... Thanks.」
She smiles.
But she still seems a bit worried...
％Ｂ
「All right! How about we try a simulation?」
Marika
「What? A simulation?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. I bet we'll get a feel for how things go once we try it out.」
％Ｂ
「So... Let's do a simulation starting with us waking up in the morning. You wake up at around 6, right?」


Marika
「Yeah, because I need to be at work at 7:30.」
％Ｂ
「Eight o'clock for me, so you're a bit earlier... Okay, then let's just say it's seven in the morning right now.」

Marika
「Oh, okay. So then I'm already awake.」
％Ｂ
「I'll go to the bedroom for now then...」
all
I walk into the bedroom.
I wait a bit, and then walk out sluggishly.
％Ｂ
「Fuaaahhh～ ...Morning～」
Marika
「Oh, good morning! Here, some coffee for you!」
She smoothly holds the Smileman mug out to me.
Marika
「Breakfast's ready too!」
％Ｂ
「Huh. What's for breakfast today?」
Marika
「It's rice with miso soup, grilled fish, and kinpira lotus root and...」
％Ｂ
「Wait a second, Marika.」
Marika
「Huh? Wh-What is it?」
％Ｂ
「Can you really prepare that much food in the morning? You've gotta spend time doing makeup and stuff too, right?」
Marika
「Oh, right～ ...Y-Yeah, you're right...」
％Ｂ
「I think it's fine to make breakfast something simple, like bread and coffee.」

％Ｂ
「If it's something like that, then I can prepare it myself.」
％Ｂ
「It sucks that I won't be able to eat your cooking... but just make it up to me with dinner.」

Marika
「Okay! You're right!」
％Ｂ
「I'll be in charge of washing dishes and taking out the garbage.」
Marika
「Then please do～」
Marika
「Oh, I'll do the cleaning and laundry.」
％Ｂ
「You sure you can do all that?」
Marika
「Yeah, I can!」
％Ｂ
「But that seems like a lot... I'll clean the bathroom, then.」

Marika
「Can I leave that to you?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, the bath'll always be sparkly clean.」
Marika
「Wow, that makes me happy～!」
Marika
「Oh, then, then... Could we perhaps do a simulation of when we get home～?」

％Ｂ
「Sure we can. When do you get home?」
Marika
「I work later sometimes, but I think it's usually around \n7 p.m.～」
％Ｂ
「Around 8 p.m. for me, so you're a little earlier again. I'll step out for a second, then.」

Marika
「Oh, then I'll come meet you at the door.」
I step out onto the front porch for a moment.
％Ｂ
「Ahem...」
I wait a bit, and then open the door.
％Ｂ
「I'm hooome～」
Marika
「W-Welcome home! ...Umm... Umm...」

Marika
「D-Dear...?」
％Ｂ
「Hngh...」
She's got her head tilted just a bit, looking embarrassed.
She's just so cute...
％Ｂ
「I'm home, Marika.」
Marika
「W-Wah... I'm being squeezed...」
I hold her close. I just can't hold back my affection.
Marika
「I-I didn't expect this～」
Seems like she doesn't know what to do.
Marika
「Umm, would you like dinner, or would you like to take a bath...?」
％Ｂ
「I want you.」
Marika
「...S-So this can happen too...?」
Marika
「U-Umm, umm... Then... me.」

％Ｂ
「Whaaat? It's okay!?」
Marika
「Because I'm your wife starting today. I... want to support my husband.」

％Ｂ
「Oh...」
％Ｂ
「Then... Marika.」
Marika
「Y-Yes...」
I gently bring my hand up to her chin.
She turns her moist eyes toward me.
％Ｂ
「Mmh...」
Marika
「Chu... pf, mmph...」
And we kiss.
It's a meltingly sweet kiss.
％Ｂ
「That was... great...」
Marika
「It-It was～」
Marika
「Then... maybe we should make that a regular thing... kissing when you get home...」
％Ｂ
「I wanna kiss before we leave for work too.」
Marika
「Then... that can be our little promise.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah.」
Marika
「Mmh, chu...」
％Ｂ
「Mmlh... nnfh...」
％Ｂ
「H-Hey... Marika.」
Marika
「What is iiit?」
％Ｂ
「How about... we clean up the bedroom a bit?」
％Ｂ
「We can't sleep with it the way it is, and...」
Marika
「M-Mhm...」
Marika
「We... can't spend the night together... either...」
She goes red.
Marika
「Now that I think about it, we turned in the forms today... s-so today's... our first night together as husband and wife... right?」

％Ｂ
「Yeah... That's right.」
We look at each other.
I don't think I can stop myself anymore.
％Ｂ
「Marika...」
Marika
「Y-Yes～」
％Ｂ
「Um. I wanna do it. I really wanna... I know you might be tired, but...」

Marika
「Auh...」
My desires are bubbling up to the surface.
The existence before me is so precious it almost hurts.
Marika
「Mhm... I want to do it too～ ...I'm totally okay...」

She nods hesitantly.
This all feels completely new.
Marika
「E-Ehehe... Saying it loud's kind of embarrassing, isn't it?」

％Ｂ
「Kinda, but... this is just what it means to live together, I think.」
Marika
「Yeah. We'll always be together. Oh... maybe we should decide on a signal or something?」

％Ｂ
「A signal?」
Marika
「Y-You know... For when we want to do it. For when it's too embarrassing to say it...」

％Ｂ
「But we were just saying it.」
Marika
「It's fine because you're a man, Ryousuke... but I think it's different for women～」

Marika
「It's fine because you're a man... but I think it's different for women～」

％Ｂ
「Right, you have a point...」
％Ｂ
「But what would a signal be like? Like, if there's eggs in the food, then we wanna do dirty stuff?」

Marika
「Yeah, like that. Like... if the pillowcase is pink.」

％Ｂ
「That's really obvious. I feel like that'd be even more embarrassing than just saying it.」

Marika
「Whaaat～ You think so? I think it's cute!」
％Ｂ
「Why don't we just be honest and say we wanna do it? C'mon, try practicing.」

Marika
「What? Y-You want me to say it now? But it's embarrassing～」
％Ｂ
「Too baaad. I want you to say it, since you feel like it too.」
Marika
「A-Auh...」
She looks up at me with slightly damp eyes.
But her cheeks are bright red, and she looks a little excited.
％Ｂ
「C'mon, practice.」
Marika
「Uuuh, you're so mean... Then, umm... Umm, umm...」

Marika
「I... would like to have sex today～」
She goes bright red and looks up at me as she says it.
It has far more powerful of an effect than I expected.
％Ｂ
「...」
％Ｂ
「...That got me so emotional. Emotional... and turned on.」

Marika
「Huh? Oh...」
Marika freezes when she sees my crotch.
I'm already almost painfully hard.
Marika
「You're... like that already?」
％Ｂ
「It's 'cause your "I want to have sex" was just that sexy.」
Marika
「Did you like it that much? I think I might be happy about that...」

Marika
「Th-Then, umm...」
She runs her fingers through her hair briefly and turns back toward me.
And then she smiles brightly at me.
Marika
「Let's... have sex today.」
％Ｂ
「Hngh...」
She tilts her head as she asks.
I can actually feel the blood pumping toward my crotch.
％Ｂ
「I don't think I can wait any longer.」
Marika
「Aaah...」
I pull her close and kiss her.
Marika
「Aahn... nnh... nnh, aah... nnhh...」
I place my lips against hers and suck on her tongue.
She pushes her tongue forward too.
Marika
「Amh, nh... aah... mmchu, chu... I love you, I love you... Nnh... aah, aahh... Chu, chu, chuph... Afh, wow... Afh...!」

Our mouths are covered in saliva in no time.
I rub her breasts and butt as we kiss.
I get a little rough with my hands.
Marika
「Aahn, aah... You're kind of intense todaaay...」
％Ｂ
「Well, it is our first night.」
Marika
「Nh, do lots... I want... lots of your love... Ahn, nmh, nh... Fuah, ah, ah...!」


I blindly grope around in Marika's clothes as she shivers with pleasure.\n\r

My fingertips make contact with her underwear.
％Ｂ
「Marika... You smell really good...」
Marika
「Oh, Do... Do I really...?」
I can smell a faint fragrance as I massage her.
It smells like a mixture between something comforting and something arousing.
Marika
「Maybe it's because... I put on just a bit of perfume earlier?」
％Ｂ
「Did you?」
Marika
「Y-Yeah... You know, the one I got as a celebration gift... I don't usually ever use perfume... but I thought maybe I could try it just for today.」


Marika
「Because... I always want to be a pretty wife for you...」
％Ｂ
「Marika...」
I'm moved at her bashful words.
To think she was thinking about stuff like that.
Marika
「Because... I always want to be a beloved wife.」
My heart shivers with her each and every word.
％Ｂ
「I'll always love you. Always...」
Marika
「Mhm... I may be inept, but I hope we can get along from now on too.」

％Ｂ
「Likewise.」
We exchange formalities as we embrace each other, and blush as we look into each other's eyes.
Marika
「Ahaha～ ...This is kind of embarrassing, isn't it?」
％Ｂ
「Though we're gonna be doing something even more embarrassing in a bit.」
Marika
「...Mhm. Do it lots, okay?」
We kiss once more, and I start taking her clothes off.
