Some guests come by the firm in the afternoon.
They're a newlywed couple who want to ask Azuma-san to design a new house for them.

The husband's apparently a fan of Azuma-san's designs, and he's passionately told us about how it's always been his dream to live in a house designed by Azuma-san.


I have to say, it makes me happy when I hear Azuma-san being praised like that, as a self-proclaimed disciple and fellow fan of his.

Azuma
「I understand. I will do everything I can to take your wishes into account.」

Looks like Azuma-san didn't mind the praise either.

％Ｂ
「Now that I think about it... I never really thought of having Teacher design my own home...」

I've known that I wanted to work together with him, but I had never thought of anything like that.

I want to have a house of my own with Natsuki one day.
Having Azuma-san design that might not be a bad idea...
％Ｂ
「But I also feel like I might wanna design my own house to live in...」

Well, either way, I still don't have the money or the experience to build a house yet...

Azuma
「Hey. Stop muttering to yourself and come here for a second.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, yes.」
Azuma
「Listen up, everyone. That couple just now commissioned us for a new house.」

Azuma
「As you all know, we're currently busy with other work. But they specifically wanted our firm to handle this. I'm planning on taking this job.」


Firm Staff A
「I thought you would.」
Firm Staff B
「It's only natural.」
So things are only going to get busier from now on.
I hope I finally get at least a little work to do...
Azuma
「On that note, I'm thinking of having a competition within the firm for the design.」
Azuma
「The clients may have asked for me specifically, but I want to use everyone's ideas for the base design, and build things up from there.」


Which means Azuma-san's going to give my senior coworkers a chance to shine with their own ideas.

all
Firm Staff A
「A firm competition, huh? I'm just itching to put my skills to the test.」

Firm Staff B
「I won't lose this time, Chief.」
Ohh, they seem really motivated.
I'll need to go with the flow and be supportive.
％Ｂ
「Good luck, everyone!」
Azuma
「The heck are you saying?」
％Ｂ
「Uh... What do you mean...?」
Azuma
「You're participating too.」
％Ｂ
「Wha, m-me too!?」
Azuma
「I just said I wanted everyone's ideas, didn't I?」
％Ｂ
「You did, but... is it really okay for me to participate too?」
Azuma
「You're awfully doubtful, aren't you? You're always so annoying about wanting work, and what, now you're scared?」


％Ｂ
「Wha...!? Of course I'm not scared! I'm completely raring to go!」

Azuma
「Don't force yourself. You don't have to participate if you don't think you can do it.」

％Ｂ
「I will definitely participate!」
Azuma
「Then do it. The theme the clients want for their house is "sunlight through the trees."」


Azuma
「They want a design that incorporates the suburban landscape itself. They apparently want their entire home to be a warm, soothing place.」


Firm Staff A
「And so they want it to evoke the image of sunlight filtering through leaves to do that. That's quite the difficult theme.」

Firm Staff B
「I think it's a very worthwhile commission.」
Azuma
「I think so too. What do you think? Can you do it?」

％Ｂ
「Of course! You can count on me!」
all
There's no way I'm gonna let this opportunity slip away!
I'm gonna submit an amazing idea and get Azuma-san and the others to acknowledge my ability!

Later that night.
I decide to mention what happened today to Natsuki while we're eating dinner.
Ryousuke・Natsuki
％Ｂ
「By the way.」
Natsuki
「By the way.」
％Ｂ・Natsuki
％Ｂ
「By the way.」
Natsuki
「By the way.」
％Ｂ
「Oh... You go first.」
Natsuki
「No, you can go
, Ryousuke

.」
％Ｂ
「You sure? Okay then...」
I tell Natsuki about the firm competition.
Natsuki
「Wow, you get to participate in the competition too? That's great!」

％Ｂ
「Yeah. It's my chance to finally get Azuma-san to acknowledge my abilities. I'm gonna try pretty hard.」


Natsuki
「That's not enough! If you're gonna do it, then you have to make sure your design's the one that's used! You definitely can't lose!」


％Ｂ
「R-Right... Yeah.」
I feel like Natsuki's weirdly pumped up...
％Ｂ
「So what'd you wanna talk about?」
Natsuki
「I'm actually in a similar situation now.」
％Ｂ
「What's that mean?」
Natsuki
「There's going to be a contest soon. I was thinking of making a submission.」

％Ｂ
「A contest? Is it another one put on by the city?」
Natsuki
「No, it's a bigger one this time. One that even a professional photographer would be proud of winning an award for. Sensei told me to submit something to see how I size up.」


％Ｂ
「Wow...」
That definitely seems like a big deal, then.
I think I get why she seems so pumped in general now.
Natsuki
「The deadline's at the end of August, and the theme is "smiles." It apparently doesn't have to be photos of people, as long as it's something that makes you think of the theme.」


％Ｂ
「Smiles, huh? It's simple, but I bet that just makes it way harder.」

I think about that photo gallery I went to with Natsuki all those years ago.\n \n\r
The theme at that one was "lovers," but there were lots of different photos, from vivid, direct ones to imaginative, indirect ones.

Natsuki
「But that's just what makes it worth doing, right? My goal's to take photos "that make everyone smile," so it's the perfect theme for me.」


Natsuki hasn't shifted one bit from the ideology she settled on back in high school.
Natsuki
「You win your firm competition. I'll win an award in that contest. Let's both surprise our bosses!」


％Ｂ
「Yeah, let's do it!」
I'm starting to get pumped too, thanks to Natsuki.
All right. I'm gonna start brainstorming ideas right away.
all
％Ｂ
「Sunlight through the trees...」
I've decided to just list off any ideas I can come up with on a notepad.

％Ｂ
「The clients are newlyweds. And Natsuki and I are newlyweds too, right?」

％Ｂ
「Which means that, outward design aside, one idea might be to just design the interior pretty much along the lines of what we'd want...」


％Ｂ
「Hey. If we were gonna build a house right now, what do think you'd want?」

Natsuki
「Let me think... First off, I'd want a house that's big and wide open.」

％Ｂ
「A big and wide-open house... Which means we'd wanna use as much of the plot as possible.」

Natsuki
「It's still just us two for now, but we'll probably have kids eventually, so I think we'd need rooms for them for sure.」

％Ｂ
「Hm... And how many were you thinking?」
Natsuki
「We both didn't have any brothers or sisters, so I might want at least two.」

％Ｂ
「Which means we'd want at least two rooms for the kids, if we're thinking of the future.」

Natsuki
「But wouldn't they each just hole up in their rooms that way, and make it hard for us to communicate as a family?」


％Ｂ
「We can always make interior windows between the rooms.」

％Ｂ
「We'll be able to see the kids' faces even when they're in their rooms that way, and if we make an atrium in the middle of the house, we'll be able to talk to them no matter where they are.」


Natsuki
「Oh, I like that idea! And I'd want a window in the ceiling and stuff too! So we could see the stars at night! The sun would shine through during the day, and the moonlight would come in at night!」


％Ｂ
「A skylight, huh? Sounds good. Let's have one in our bedroom, and the kids' rooms too.」

Natsuki
「Is it really okay to stuff in a bunch of what we want like this?」

％Ｂ
「The clients are newlyweds too. I'm sure their wishes are basically the same.」


Natsuki
「Can I say lots more, then?」
％Ｂ
「Of course.」
Natsuki
「I want the bath to be big enough for all four of us to be in together! And I wanna be able to cook together with the kids in the kitchen too, and the bathrooms―」


Natsuki comes up with one idea after another, and I write them all down.
I can see our future together in these ideas.
It's a list that describes what the two of us want to do together as a family in the near future, when we have kids... This notepad is filled with our dreams for the future.


all
％Ｂ
「Phew... Sorry to make you wait.」
Natsuki's typing away on her phone when I come back from taking a bath.
Natsuki
「Mmm... I'll go in once I'm done sending this.」
％Ｂ
「Typing up some mail?」
Natsuki
「Mhm... Just something for the class reunion... Nirasawa's going to be coordinating things, but I'm still the person who started this in the first place, so I need to make sure I have an idea of everything that's going on.」


％Ｂ
「Guess it's a lot of work for you after all?」
Natsuki
「It's not that bad. Marika and Rikka are helping out too, and we're asking a professional too.」


％Ｂ
「A professional?」
Natsuki
「There are people whose job is to manage stuff like this on others' behalfs. I'm not doing too much work, thanks to the one who's helping us.」


％Ｂ
「What kinda stuff do they do for you?」
Natsuki
「They apparently do stuff like taking care of seeing who is and isn't going to come.」

％Ｂ
「Like, they'll send everyone in our graduating class invitations and stuff?」
Natsuki
「Mhm. They'll do some research for people who've moved away too. And they make stuff like this too.」


She shows me her phone screen.
Natsuki
「It's a special webpage just for the class reunion. You can make announcements about the date and place here, and you can apparently do online RSVPs through it too.」


％Ｂ
「Huh... I didn't know they had stuff like this now. I'm surprised you managed to find someone who does this kinda work.」

Natsuki
「They're people Sensei knows. Because big class reunions like to hire professional cameramen for commemorative photos and snapshots.」


Natsuki
「I've gone to those kinds of things a few times with Sensei before.」

％Ｂ
「Really now...」
But I don't think the fact that she's got connections with them detracts from the fact that they've managed to get this much done in such a short span of time...

They're really dependable...
all
％Ｂ
「Oh, the date's decided already?」
The date and place are already up on the website.
It's on August 30th, a Sunday.
The place is Shionagi First Academy's grounds... Wait, the grounds?
％Ｂ
「Is it gonna be like a garden party? You've gotten permission from the school already, right?」

Natsuki
「Nirasawa's the one who picked the place, so probably?」
％Ｂ
「Really...」
She may be the person who came up with the idea for the class reunion, but I dunno if she sounds particularly dependable for the planning...
