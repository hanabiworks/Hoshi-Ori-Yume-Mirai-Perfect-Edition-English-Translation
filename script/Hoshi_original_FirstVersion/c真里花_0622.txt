「Fuaaah...」
I'm still tired. Maybe I took in a bit too much sun yesterday.
It's a good thing it's still the weekend. I've been just lying around in my room all morning.

「Living alone's nice and all, but it's bad in times like these.」
I bet my mom would be yelling at me to go do homework or something if she were here right now.
I just can't help but take it easy on myself when I'm alone.

「That's my excuse... but Shinozaki's working at the pool in the morning again today...」

And compared to her, I'm still sitting in bed.
Is this what people mean when they talk about societal stratification?
...No, it's not.
I'm just lazing around like this, when Shinozaki's giving her all at her part-time job after doing the same thing I did yesterday...

％Ｂ
「Okay! Let's get up!!」
I leap out of bed.
I can't let myself lose to Shinozaki, after all.
...But what should I do?

「I know. The filters that Okihara-senpai talked to me about.」
She asked if it could be possible to make the water tank filters ourselves.
The naturalist club doesn't have enough, as one would expect, and they'd be pricey to purchase.

They apparently doesn't have to be anything too complex of a design, so she said that making our own would be ideal.

「Let's start with looking it up on the internet.」
％Ｂ
「I see. Looks easier than I thought. I think we could make it ourselves this way.」
Making a homemade filter looks doable.
I've found a decent number of web pages that explain how to make one.\n\r
It's actually pretty simple, so I think I might even be able to make one by myself.
％Ｂ
「Let's get the materials together first. Let's see...」

There are a lot of different methods, as expected, with lots of differences that I can't quite make any judgments over.\n\r

It might be best to discuss this with Okihara-senpai.
％Ｂ
「Guess I'll contact her over LIME.」
I send her a LIME message.
【％Ｂ】「I've tried looking up #Nthings for a filter #Nunit. I think it should #Nbe doable to make them #Nourselves. I'd like to #Ndiscuss materials...」
【Misa】「Thank you very much for #Nlooking into it. If #Nthat's the case, would #Nyou like to come #Nshopping with me?」
【Misa】「I was just about to go #Nsee if there was #Nanything we could #Npossibly use for the #Naquarium.」
【％Ｂ】「Okay. Would you like to #Nmeet up at the train #Nstation in 30 minutes, #Nthen?」
【Misa】「Yes. I will see you #Nthen and there.」

Our plans were settled immediately.
It really is a matter of motivation, I guess.
％Ｂ
「All right!」
I wanna try to get the materials together by the end of today, and start working on the filters tomorrow.
