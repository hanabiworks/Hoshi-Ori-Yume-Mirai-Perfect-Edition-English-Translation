「Please excuse uuus. How are things progressing, Senpai?」
Misa
「Welcome, both of you. There is no end to the ideas we can think of, thanks to Marika-san!」


Okihara-senpai and Shinozaki are steadily working through preparations together.
They're apparently coming up with ideas for the water tank design right now.
all
Touko
「Huh, so this is how these work. There are lots of interesting-looking gadgets here.」

％Ｂ
「Don't break anything, all right?」
Touko
「Don't worryyy. I wonder why seeing laboratory equipment gets me so excited?」

all
Misa
「They're very fun, aren't they? I can never help myself from becoming very enthusiastic during cooking classes or extracurriculars.」

I imagine Okihara-senpai working away while wearing an apron or a lab coat.
...Very soothing.
Misa
「Oh, I will get some tea ready. Please wait one moment.」
％Ｂ
「Oh no, there's no need.」
all
Wait a second. How can she get tea ready here?
...We are in the second chemistry classroom, aren't we?
Touko
「Hey, look, look! This is so cool! Doesn't it look like something you could make dangerous drugs with!?」

％Ｂ
「Wow, that is a weird shape. Wonder if they use it for complicated experiments or something.」
Touko
「It's so cool! I wanna try simmering weirdly colored liquids while wearing a really tattered lab coat!」

...Is that really the part of this that's exciting for her?
I still don't really understand Touko's tastes...
all
Misa
「Thank you very much for waiting. It's black tea, but is that okay with you?」
％Ｂ
「Oh, yes. That's fine.」
Misa
「I must apologize. I was short one cup... and so I will be using this to drink. You can use the cups.」


But that's no reason to pour the tea into a beaker...
I want Okihara-senpai to be a little prouder of her own image.
％Ｂ
「It's okay. I can drink from this.」
Misa
「Oh no, I couldn't possibly be so rude to a guest! It was my own fault for being ill prepared, and so I should...!」


Touko
「Mmm... I kinda wanna try that too. Drinking black tea from a beaker is kinda cool, don't you think?」

Misa
「What should I do... I had no idea beakers were so popular...」

％Ｂ
「I think it's more that it's just rare. You don't really get to drink tea from a beaker every day.」

Misa
「...I see, that is very true. I have also become interested! I will now go and repour the tea into four beakers!」


Marika
「Ahaha... I think I might want to drink from a normal cup～」
％Ｂ
「No, no! It's fine! I'll have that!」
all
I swipe the beaker out of her hand.
I down the tea in one go.
Touko
「Ahhh! That's not fair! You should've shared with meee! You can't drink all of it!」

％Ｂ
「Urp... Thank you very much for the tea.」
Misa
「Oh dear... Would you like more? Oh, I also have snacks.」

Touko
「Snacks!? I want snacks! You're the best, Jellyfish-senpai!」
Misa
「I'll bring them together with Ryousuke-san's tea. Please wait one moment.」

Misa
「Please wait one moment.」
all
％Ｂ
「Gasp!? We don't have the time to just sit around and drink tea!」
I got sidetracked by Okihara-senpai's serene aura.
Plus, Touko's suddenly asleep!
Misa
「I apologize for taking so much of your time while you two are so busy. It was just so fun to chat.」

％Ｂ
「Oh no, it's fine. Anyway, please continue your work.」
Marika
「Mhm, we'll handle it! We'll let you know if we come across any issues.」
all
％Ｂ
「Great. Come on, Touko, we're going! To the astronomy club next!」
Touko
「Nnnhh...! But I was so comfy sleepiiing...!」
_00cutinBS
％Ｂ
「Oh, there she is. Ousaka, I'm here to talk about the Tanabata Festival.」
_00cutinBS
The clubs are going to have to get started on their preparations soon, if they haven't already.
Ousaka's the only person in the astronomy club. She'd probably want someone helping her too...

％Ｂ
「I remember I ran into you while you were shopping the other day. You figure out what you're doing?」
Sora
「A talk show about stargazing and star-related topics.」
...Ousaka, doing a talk show?
...Is that really gonna work?
％Ｂ
「You got anyone helping you? You can't do it all yourself, can you?」
Sora
「...*shake shake*」
％Ｂ
「Let's see... It'd be great if there was someone you knew who was free...」

all
And that's when I hear the faint sounds of piano playing.
Touko
「I guess that's Piano-chan? Her playing's as nice as always.」
％Ｂ
「...Actually, there is someone who'd be the perfect helper for the astronomy club!」
Sora
「...Who?」
％Ｂ
「Hear me out, guys. Let's put together a strategy.」
all
％Ｂ
「...Excuse meee.」
Rikka
「Oh, do you need something?」
％Ｂ
「Sorry to intrude. I'm here 'cause I have a favor to ask of you.」

Rikka
「A favor? From me?」
The reason I came to this music classroom...
Is to recruit a certain someone who isn't a part of any club or committee―Narusawa―as a support member for the astronomy club.

Rikka
「...I'll at least hear what you have to say.」
％Ｂ
「It's about the Tanabata Festival.」
Rikka
「I refuse.」
％Ｂ
「...Couldn't you at least let me finish?」
Rikka
「It's going to be the same answer regardless. I have no intention of helping with the Tanabata Festival.」

％Ｂ
「Okay... It's a shame, 'cause you agreeing would help Ousaka's dreams come true...」

Touko
「If only we had someone else we could rely on... I thought Piano-chan might be able to do it well, since Fluffyhead's shy...」


Rikka
「O-Ousaka-san? What does Ousaka-san have to do with this?」
％Ｂ
「I wanted to ask you to help the astronomy club. See...」

all
％Ｂ
「...And that pretty much sums it up. You're the only person we can go to for helping the astronomy club.」

Rikka
「I'm the only... What am I supposed to do with that information? I don't even know how I would help...」

％Ｂ
「You don't have to do anything you can't. Please. Help make Ousaka's dream come true.」

I'm just throwing out this whole "Tanabata Festival display ＝ Ousaka's dream" thing out there, but let's just say it's a bit of a theatrical elaboration.

We're trying to appeal to Narusawa's emotions. We can afford to get a little pushy.
Touko
「We talked to Fluffyhead about it this morning... and she was a little down about it... I think she still might be a bit depressed.」


％Ｂ
「Ousaka's doing her best to not make us worry. I thought you might understand how she feels, doing all that by herself all this time.」


Rikka
「...I...」
％Ｂ
「I promise we won't ask anything ridiculous of you. Please help the astronomy club. Please, Narusawa!」

Touko
「From me too. You're the only one who can put a smile on Fluffyhead's face, Piano-chan.」

We both lower our heads, as we rehearsed.
Still, though... Touko's even better at this than I expected.
Maybe she's got acting talent or something?
Rikka
「...I'd only do what I can, okay? And I'll make my final decision after hearing everything...」

％Ｂ
「All right, got it! Then let's go to Ousaka right away! Touko!」

Touko
「Okaaay. Let's go then, Piano-chan.」
Rikka
「Kyah! W-Wait, Yukimura-san!? I don't remember you being like this!」

Touko
「Because it seemed fun. Anyway, just listen to what she has to say, and think about it.」

％Ｂ
「I'll let Ousaka know now.」
all
【％Ｂ】「Got you a helper.」
Rikka
「I didn't say I'd do it yet! I said I'd think about it after hearing...!」

％Ｂ
「My bad. Already sent it.」
【Sora】_st_0310
【Sora】「Job well done.」
I have been praised.
All that's left is to do a good job serving as the intermediary between Narusawa and Ousaka.
％Ｂ
「We're here, Ousaka. With the savior of the astronomy club.」
Sora
「Thanks. Appreciate it. Ritsu helping gives me peace of mind. Let's work hard together, okay?」

Rikka
「...This isn't fair
, Hino-kun

...」
Ousaka's got this mysterious aura she emits that stirs your protective instinct.
I imagine it's a Herculean task to decline a request with her before you like this.
Sora
「Hurry, Ritsu. Let's think together.」
Rikka
「O-Ousaka-san! I still haven't said I'd...! Wait, no, don't pull on my skirt...!」

all
Touko
「Oh dear. She got dragged away.」
％Ｂ
「The astronomy club should be good now. I'll let Shuuichi know.」
Touko
「Are you sure? Piano-chan never said she'd do it.」

％Ｂ
「I personally can't imagine her saying no, considering that.」
all
Narusawa's peering into the telescope at Ousaka's urging.
I think those two might get along better than I had expected.
...Hope things go well.
all
％Ｂ
「We can probably leave the rest up to Ousaka. I bet they'll make something great.」

Touko
「...Mhm, you're right.」
all
We ended up finishing our work a little later than usual, because of the naturalist club teatime.

It's already dark out. There aren't many students still here.
Touko
「Hey, doesn't being at school at night get you excited?」
％Ｂ
「Huh? What are you saying all of a sudden?」
Touko
「There are always so many students during the day, but it gets this quiet at night. Doesn't it feel like a completely different place?」

％Ｂ
「Oh... Yeah, I think I could see that.」
Touko
「Why don't we explore a little while we're still here? It'd be nice if you could tag along with some stuff with me sometimes.」

％Ｂ
「Explore... You mean explore the school at night?」
Touko
「Right. It's like a date.」
...Is that fun?
I'd understand if it were a haunted house at an amusement park, but being at an empty school at night doesn't sound even the slightest bit suited for a date.

Touko
「Okay, let's go, then. I wonder if we'll see something interesting!」

Touko
「Oh, look... Isn't that door open a bit?」
％Ｂ
「That's... the pool? Man, that's careless... Though I guess there's nothing you can steal from a pool.」

Touko
「Hey, let's go there! You don't get to be in a completely empty pool that often, right!?」

％Ｂ
「Agh, don't pull! I'll come with! Don't run, it's dangerous!」

The pool, with no one around.
There's nothing but the moonlight shining in through the ceiling windows and the slightest sounds of water. It feels strangely sacred here.

Touko
「...It's so quiet.」
Touko lets go of my hand and slowly walks along the poolside.
She stops a few steps in and stares at the serene surface of the water.

％Ｂ
「Touko? What are you...?」
Touko
「Hup!」
％Ｂ
「...Uh?」
Touko
「Ahahah! It's nice and cool!」
％Ｂ
「Wh-What the heck are you doing!? Just jumping in like that...!」
Touko
「It just seemed fun! You don't really get chances to jump into a pool while wearing your school uniform, right?」

Her smile seems brighter than usual.
She's dripping with allure. As well as water, of course.

Touko
「Mm? You're just staring... What's wrong?」
％Ｂ
「N-Nothing. I was just surprised...」
Touko
「Why don't you come in too
, Ryousuke-kun

? It feels really nice.」

％Ｂ
「Uh, but...」
I can't say anything.
It's true that I'm surprised at her sudden actions, but there's another reason.
Her white uniform's become transparent, and I can see her underwear through it.
The hem of her skirt flutters and floats in the water.
She's... incredibly pretty, with the moonlight illuminating her as she floats in the water.

Touko
「Geez, you're no fun. There's no one around, and it feels nice, so why not?」

％Ｂ
「That's not the issue here! You're soaking wet... How are you planning on going home like that!?」

Touko
「Oh, you're right. What to do... Well, it's summer, so I guess it should be fine?」

％Ｂ
「Should be... Come on.」
Touko
「We have this huge pool all to ourselves, though. We need to enjoy it as much as we can while we're here.」

％Ｂ
「Enjoy it? ...There are other ways of enjoying it, aren't there!?」

Touko
「Just splashing your feet in the water wouldn't be fun though. Besides, thinking about consequences and stuff's only going to make it less fun.」


％Ｂ
「...You've really got some guts, Touko.」
Touko
「Ehehe, praise me mooore.」
It wasn't meant as praise...
But Touko's in an incredibly good mood. I don't even have it in me to correct her.
Touko
「Wonder if there are any toys around... Like a beach ball or water guns or something.」

％Ｂ
「You know this pool's for class and club activities, right? ...It's not for fun and games.」

Touko
「They're so badly prepaaared. They should let us have at least a little fun here.」

...That seems a bit ridiculous.
I feel like she might start talking about how they should build a water slide or something at some point.
Touko
「...Well, it's cliché, but let's splash each other with water then. It's not fair if I'm the only one who's wet, right?」

％Ｂ
「What!? You're the one who jumped in on your own! Fairness has nothing to do with this!」

Touko
「Now, now. It's fiiine. Don't worry about the small stuff. Here, come on.」

"Come on," she says... What to do.
I guess I could have her wear my jacket on the way back.
But...
What would be the point if I got wet too?
Touko
「Hurry hurryyy. You shouldn't make a girl wait, you knooow.」
％Ｂ
「...Then let me at least take my jacket off. Since I was gonna let you wear that afterward.」

Touko
「Mm, okay. Ehehe, you're so niiice.」
I pull the top of my uniform off.
As for my pants... I can probably just wring them out afterward.\n\r
Gotta make sure to take my phone and wallet out of my pockets.
Touko
「Okay, come on iiiin.」
I take Touko's outstretched hand.
Jumping's dangerous, so slowly...
Touko
「Rragh!」
％Ｂ
「Agh!?」
％Ｂ
「Pfah!」
Touko
「Ahahahah! You okaaay?」
％Ｂ
「Cough, kaff...! N-No, I'm not...! Got water in my nose...!」

Touko
「Sorry, soorry. I didn't think you'd go face-first like that! That was a beautiful dive, though!」


％Ｂ
「Kaff... Aghh... That was awful.」
Touko
「It's because you tried to go in slowly. You have to do stuff like this with all your heart, or else it won't feel good.」

％Ｂ
「You put too much of your heart into this... This is too much...」

Touko
「Ahaha, you think so? Don't worry about the little things, okay?」
Her smile shines dazzlingly, reflecting the moonlight.
She genuinely looks like she's having so much fun. A smile floats onto my face too.
Touko
「I... never would've gotten to do something this fun or nice if I weren't with you
, Ryousuke-kun

.」

％Ｂ
「I know there's still lots of stuff like this. Let's discover them together.」

Touko
「...Mhm. Yeah.」
％Ｂ
「Hey. Wanna go to the pool together sometime? Let's wear some proper swimsuits and have a ton of fun together.」

Touko
「Huh? Sure... I guess it's because you want to see me in a swimsuit?」
％Ｂ
「...No, that's not why. I just wanna have fun without holding back...」
Touko
「But you've been glancing down this whole time. I just thought you wanted to see my swimsuit too, and not just my underwear.」

...So she realized.
You can't blame me, though. I can see right through her skirt, and it's just bobbing up and down right in front of me!

Touko
「Ahaha, just when you were saying something cool, too. I guess you should've been a little more careful?」

％Ｂ
「Sh-Shut up! I'm a guy, so of course I'd look! I can't help it!」

Touko
「Would you look if you ended up like this with a girl other than me?」
Uh... That's a hard-to-answer question!
I doubt I'd sound too convincing if I was like, "I wouldn't for anyone other than you, Touko!"

％Ｂ
「...I wouldn't get in a pool like this with anyone other than you. Or more like a normal girl wouldn't jump into a pool with her uniform on.」

Touko
「Ahahah! I see, so that's your answer! Yeah, that might be true.」
％Ｂ
「Right? So please, if you'd stop just doing crazy stuff without thinking about the consequences.」

Touko
「Okaaay. I'll try not to cause so much trouble.」
％Ｂ
「We have to worry about what we're gonna wear, and it'd be awful if we caught a cold or something. And... I don't want anyone other than me to see you like this.」

Touko
「Wha...?」
％Ｂ
「A swimsuit's where I draw the line! To be honest, I don't even like the idea of other people seeing you in a swimsuit... Anyway, that's why! Get it!?」

Touko
「M-Mhm... I'll be careful.」
％Ｂ
「Agh... It's gotten really late. I'm glad our clothes dried out faster than I expected, though.」

Touko
「...Yeah. We might've gotten a bit too excited.」
％Ｂ
「But it was fun. And now I can look forward to going to the pool together too.」

Touko
「...Mhm. Yeah.」
％Ｂ
「...Something up? You cold from getting wet?」
Touko
「Mmm... The opposite, actually. I'm all warm.」
％Ｂ
「Oh yeah, like how you get weirdly flushed after getting out of a pool. I hear it's something about how you feel hot from the difference in temperatures and your muscle fatigue.」


Touko
「...That's not really what I meeeant.」
She grabs my hand.
I jump at the suddenness.
Touko
「See? You're warm too now, right?」
％Ｂ
「...Yeah.」
We're squeezing each other's hands a little stronger than usual.
Even a minor detail like that's enough to fill me with happiness on our wonderful walk home.
