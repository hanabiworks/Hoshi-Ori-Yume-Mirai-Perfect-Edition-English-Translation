...It happened during lunch.
The boys in class were fighting over a leftover pudding cup.
I wasn't participating.
Because that pudding cup was Shinozaki's.
She wasn't here that day either.
Same as the previous day, and the day before that.
She was at school the day before that, but she left after eating lunch.
Right. We got pudding that day too.
Boy A
「Remember how she started coughing and spat out the pudding right away～?」

Boy B
「That was so gross! She should just never come to school, so no one catches what she has.」

When I think back on it now, those might've just been the naive words of children.\n\r

But I couldn't stay quiet back then.
％Ｂ
「Hey.」
Boy A
「Hm? What
, Hino

?」
％Ｂ
「That pudding isn't yours!」
Boy A
「Gyah! Hey, give it back!」
Boy B
「He's gonna eat it by himself!」
％Ｂ
「Shut up!! You can't catch asthma, you idiot!」

Boy A
「What the heck!!」
Boy B
「Get him!!」
％Ｂ
「Go ahead, try it!」
We got in a brawl.
We were yelled at by the teacher afterward, of course.
I was asked to stay after classes that day.
Homeroom Teacher
「Honestly. How did it turn into a fight?」
％Ｂ
「Because they tried to hit me first...」
Homeroom Teacher
「I mean before that. Why'd you try to take that pudding?」

％Ｂ
「Because... I just got annoyed because they wanted to have an extra pudding...」

Homeroom Teacher
「That's your fault then
, Hino. 
. 
Don't you think you should apologize?」

％Ｂ
「I don't think I'm wrong. So I won't.」

I was yelled at harshly, but I didn't say a single word of apology.
I thought that was why I was told to stay behind, but...
Homeroom Teacher
「Good grief. We'll have to talk about this again. Until you tell me the real reason why, and we understand each other.」

％Ｂ
「I told you, there's no real reason...」
Homeroom Teacher
「Now then, this would be the pudding cup that caused today's issue.」
My teacher pulled out the pudding from lunch.
The one that had been left over. Shinozaki's pudding.
Homeroom Teacher
「I'm going to put in this pudding along with today's printouts, so could you take them?」

％Ｂ
「...Was that supposed to be a pun just now?」
Homeroom Teacher
「What? A pun?」
％Ｂ
「"Put in" and "pudding." That was really lame, you know.」

Homeroom Teacher
「No, that wasn't my intention...」
％Ｂ
「But okay, sure. I'll take the printouts and pudding to Shinozaki.」

I said it bluntly on purpose. Being honest was kind of embarrassing.
Our teacher smiled kindly.
Homeroom Teacher
「Shinozaki doesn't have any friends at school, because she doesn't come that often. Could you be her friend

, Hino

?」
％Ｂ
「What are you talking about? We're already friends, you know.」

Homeroom Teacher
「...Ahahaha, I see. Then I'll leave the printouts and pudding to you.」

I was already pretty used to going to Shinozaki's house at that point.
Though I still wasn't used to the taste of the slightly high-class black tea I was given every time.
Yumi
「Oh, just a minute
, Hino-kun

. Marika says she's feeling okay today, so she'll come down.」

％Ｂ
「Oh... Okay.」
Shinozaki usually didn't come down from her room.
She arrived soon enough while I was fidgeting.
Marika
「Umm～ ...Sorry for being in pajamas...」
％Ｂ
「It's fine. Your mom said you were feeling okay. That's great.」

Marika
「Yeah, thanks. I think it's thanks to you

, Hino-kun

.」
％Ｂ
「Me? Why?」
Marika
「Because... I just think so.」
％Ｂ
「Hmm? Oh, right, here. Today's printouts, and... the pudding we had for lunch today.」


She looked surprised when I showed her the pudding cup. Probably because this was the first time I had brought something from lunch.

％Ｂ
「The teacher said to bring this to you. You like pudding, Shinozaki?」

Marika
「Yeah, I love it. I couldn't finish it because I started feeling sick halfway through last time... but I think I'll be fine now.」


％Ｂ
「Then here, eat it.」
Marika
「Huh? ...Now?」
％Ｂ
「It's your house, isn't it?」
Marika
「...Yeah, you're right. I'll eat it, then.」

Her mom immediately stopped by with a spoon. She must've been able to hear us.

Marika
「Let's eaaat... Ahm. It's really good!」

％Ｂ
「Right? It sucks when you can't eat good stuff like that. So, you know... um...」


％Ｂ
「Hurry up and get better, and come to school.」
Marika
「Wha...」
％Ｂ
「I'll be waiting for you.」
Marika
「...Hgh...」
％Ｂ
「Huh? Hey, Shinozaki...」
Tears welled up in her eyes right before my own.
％Ｂ
「H-Hey, don't cry. Why are you crying?」

Marika
「I-I'm not crying... Hgh... fueh...」
％Ｂ
「You're totally crying! Agh, you're getting tears in the pudding!」

Marika
「This pud, ding's... saltyyy... hgh...」
％Ｂ
「Don't cry～ Oh, I know! I'll sing a song for you! You know "Smileman"?」


％Ｂ
「With our smile puuunch, we can't be beat～♪ ...Come on, Shinozaki! Sing along!」

Marika
「With our smiiile... *sob*...」
％Ｂ
「Ahhh! Don't sing while you eat, you're getting pudding all over the place!」

Marika
「With our smiiile... Fueeeh, it's so salty～」
She ate all of that pudding, complaining about how salty it was, while sobbing and crying.

When I left the house and turned around, I could see Shinozaki waving timidly from the second-floor window.
Her eyes were red, but she was done crying. She looked happy.
I made a big show of waving back at her.
I could see her smile in response.
So I waved even more at her, moving my whole body.
I'd be happy about not having to go to school every now and then.
But I'm sure it's really rough to not be able to go all the time like Shinozaki. I'm sure it's lonely too.

That was around when I started thinking of ways I could cheer her up...

$$smh_OpenCHK
％Ｂ
「Oh, that's...」
I run into a pretty familiar girl on my way back from the bathroom during break.

％Ｂ
「Yo, Yukimura. What are you up to?」
Touko
「Hm? Nothing really. Just wandering around. I've got nothing to do because it's always just me.」

％Ｂ
「It's always just you... Don't you have any friends?」
Touko
「I do if you count people I just say hi to in the mornings.」

％Ｂ
「I'm talking about people you eat lunch with or hang out with.」

Touko
「Then nope, I don't.」
Yukimura doesn't seem bothered by that at all.
I don't really think that's a subject to be that cheery about...
％Ｂ
「Hey, you've got a cell phone, right? Let's trade contact info.」

Touko
「Huh? I have one... but why?」
％Ｂ
「I figured we could be friends.」
Touko
「...You really are weird. Why would you say you want to be friends with me?」

％Ｂ
「I thought it'd be fun if I had a weirdo like you as a friend.」

Touko
「Excuse me? How rude. Who do you think you're calling a weirdo, weirdo?」

She looks annoyed.
Yep. She seems fun.
Touko
「Look at you smiling when someone's calling you a weirdo. You're definitely the weird one.」

％Ｂ
「Sure, we can say that. Besides, I can't come hang out in the old school building if I can't contact you, right?」


Touko
「Right, you and I are both trespassers in the old school building. Okay, sure. I'll tell you my contact details.」

％Ｂ
「...I guess that's technically true, but couldn't you phrase it a little better?」

Touko
「Let's see... How do I do this again? I only ever use my phone for alarms and maps.」

％Ｂ
「You should make sure you can use it when you need to. It'll be trouble for you otherwise.」

Touko
「Like when?」
％Ｂ
「Like now, when people ask you for your contact details, or when you need to call someone. There are lots of situations.」

Touko
「Not really. You're the first person to ask for my contact details anyway.」
％Ｂ
「...Excuse me?」
Touko
「And it's not like I've ever told anyone mine, since it's not like I felt like it was necessary, other than for my family.」

％Ｂ
「Can I see that for a second?」
Touko
「Mm, sure.」
all
I take Yukimura's smartphone from her.
An absolutely ridiculous number of notifications are on the screen.
％Ｂ
「Agh, what's up with all this unread mail!? Don't you take care of your inbox!?」

Touko
「It's all just spam anyway, right? I don't really know about that stuff, so I just ignore it.」

％Ｂ
「Let's see, how do you transmit... There it is. Now we can trade numbers... Okay, done.」

Touko
「Huh? Done already? You're pretty good.」
％Ｂ
「...Thank you very much. Check to make sure I'm in there.」

Touko
「Huh? How?」
％Ｂ
「Here, you can see the addresses you have registered here. See how my name, number, and mail address are there?」

Touko
「I seeee. So this is how you register numbers... Oh!」
％Ｂ
「Hm? What's wrong?」
Touko
「The screen went black.」
％Ｂ
「Did it break? That doesn't seem likely... Is it out of battery? When'd you charge this last?」

Touko
「...No idea. I don't remember.」
％Ｂ
「You should make it a habit to charge your phone.」
Touko
「I just forget to do it because I don't use it much.」
％Ｂ
「What's the point of having a cell phone then? There aren't many things more useless than a smartphone with a dead battery.」

Touko
「I told you I use it for alarms and maps. I make plenty good use for it.」

％Ｂ
「...Whatever. You should set up a mail address too. I'll show you how to do it sometime, so think of an address you want in the meantime.」


Touko
「I don't care what it is. Not like I ever use mail anyway.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, but I'm gonna send you mail from now on. You don't wanna be buried in spam all the time either, do you?」

Touko
「Mmm... I'll think about it if I feel like it.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. I'll contact you when I wanna go to the old school building, then.」
Touko
「Mm. Later then～」
％Ｂ
「Make sure you charge that thing, all right?」
all
I'm worried about whether I'll be able to get in contact with her from now on...
I know I won't be able to today at least, since her phone's out of battery.

％Ｂ
「Oh, gotta get back.」
The first bell rings. Class is starting soon.
I put my phone away and hurry back to class.
After school that day...
Marika
「Oh, here it is. Here, this.」
I'm at Shinozaki's house like I promised.
She's brought out a big folder.
It's filled with lots of paper that's turned brownish from age.
They're the printouts from elementary school.
％Ｂ
「You still have all these? Well aren't you sentimental?」

Marika
「I couldn't just throw them away.」
She flips over one of the printouts.
It's absolutely covered in pencil drawings.
I drew them back in elementary school.
Marika
「You always drew lots of pictures on the printouts you were going to give me. I always looked forward to them.」


％Ｂ
「Looking at them now, I think they're still my finest work. Totally worth ignoring the teachers during class to draw them.」


Marika
「Huh? You drew all of these during class? That's not good～ You need to listen in class.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, seriously. I've become a worthless human being thanks to that...」

Marika
「Th-That's not true! You're great～」



It's fun watching her react so seriously to everything.
％Ｂ
「But still, even I'm impressed I drew this much.」
all
I take a look at the scribbles.
They're not just random drawings either. They essentially form a diary of the day's events.

Drawings of funny things that happened in class, sketches and anthropomorphized drawings of animals from when we went on a field trip to the zoo, and drawings of anime characters that were popular in our class.


You can tell just from looking that I had customized it as much as I could to entertain Shinozaki while keeping her in the know about class.

Marika
「I could tell what you were doing at school, and I always thought it seemed like you were having fun. So I knew I needed to get better soon.」


Marika
「I was so, so happy that you brought me these printouts. It was so encouraging.」


％Ｂ
「That's great. You seemed so lonely back then.」

I can still remember it now.
She wouldn't really show her face even when I came over. I'd just see her looking sad from that second-story window.

I just couldn't leave that Shinozaki alone.
Marika
「I couldn't tell anyone this, but being in my room all day every day, it made me feel like everyone forgot about me... I was really lonely.」


Marika
「That's why I was so happy that there was someone who cared about me.」

Marika
「I might've lost heart if it were just me. That's why... 

Hino-kun, 

you're the reason I was able to get better.」
％Ｂ
「It's a bit embarrassing when you say it like that, though it makes me happy. But it's still all thanks to the effort you put in, Shinozaki.」

Marika
「No, it's all thanks to you
, Hino-kun

～」
She smiles like a kid.
I can't even be modest before that smile.
Marika
「I kinda wasn't surprised when you told me you wanted to be an architect.」




％Ｂ
「Really?」
Marika
「Being an architect's all about making places where people feel comfortable, right?」

Marika
「It's a job where you make places where people can have fun, where they can be happy. I just thought it was perfect for you.」

Marika
「I think you'll be able to make places where lots of people can be happy.」

％Ｂ
「...Thanks. I hope you're right.」

all
A job where you make places where people can be happy... I see.
Marika
「What's wrong?」
％Ｂ
「Oh, no, nothing. How about you, Shinozaki? You got anything you wanna do?」

I change the subject.
Marika
「Yeah, lots.」
She flashes an easy smile.
She flips through the folder.
all
She pulls out some old tanzaku.
Looks like she wrote those when she was a kid.
Each of them has a childish, but still serious wish written on it. 

"I want to run as hard as I can."
"I want to swim through the waves."
"I want to sing loud."
Marika
「"I want to find fun things, together
 with Hino-kun

." That sure takes me back～」

She looks up and stares at me with sparkling eyes.
Marika
「I want to help you
, Hino-kun

. I think... that might be what I want to do most.」

Shinozaki's words seep smoothly into my heart.
I'm already nodding.
％Ｂ
「Yeah. I want you to help me too. Let's... do lots of stuff, the two of us, so everyone can have fun.」

Marika
「Okay!」
