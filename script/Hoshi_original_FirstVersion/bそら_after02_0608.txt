「...Good morning.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah... Morning... fuaaahh... afh... What time is it?」
Sora
「...Eight. In the morning.」
％Ｂ
「Eight in the morning... Ughh... I hurt all over...」
Sora
「...You stayed the night again?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah... I was able to get a lot done last night. I was drawing out rough drafts until dawn.」
Sora
「...Here. Lunch.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, thanks. Sorry for the trouble.」
Sora
「...*shake shake*」
all
My life's been pretty busy lately.
I go to the construction site for Shuuichi's house during the day, and spend all night at the office drawing out rough drafts for the cultural hall afterward.

I have to attend meetings, set up plans, and contact contractors for one remodeling commission after another in the meantime.

I genuinely don't have any time to rest right now.
I've been staying the night at the office more and more.
Sora's started going out of her way to come to the firm before work to hand me a homemade lunchbox.


And after she's done with work, she buys dinner for me somewhere, comes to the firm again, grabs the empty lunchbox, and goes home.

She stays in the office with me the entire day if she doesn't have work.
％Ｂ
「You have work today?」
Sora
「...*shake shake*」
Sora
「...I'm off. So I'll be here today.」
％Ｂ
「Okay. I'll go drop by the site for Shuuichi's house in the morning, so let's meet up somewhere after that and get lunch together.」

Sora
「...It's raining.」
％Ｂ
「Wha, really?」
Sora
「...Rainy season starts today.」
all
I pull open a gap in the blinds with my fingers and look outside.
％Ｂ
「Oh... It's raining pretty hard. Construction's gonna be canceled today at this rate.」
Sora
「...If you have more time, then you should go back to sleep.」
％Ｂ
「No, if I've got more time, then that works better for me. I'll keep working on the rough drafts for the cultural hall. I've gotta go show them to Teacher next week.」


％Ｂ
「I wanna keep working on them while I've still got the image in my head from back when we went to Shionagi First Academy.」

Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「Don't make that face. I'll be fine. I'm nothing if not durable. Being a little sleep deprived isn't that big of a deal.」


％Ｂ
「More importantly, sorry about all this. You had to get up early to make a lunchbox for me even though you're off today.」

Sora
「...*shake shake*」
％Ｂ
「And I haven't been able to take you anywhere lately either...」
Sora
「...*shake shake*」
％Ｂ
「And the last time we went to go see the stars was back in winter, at that campground... Wanna go see them again sometime soon?」

Sora
「...*shake shake, shake shake*」
W-Wait, what?
Sora
「...If you're going to overexert yourself for that, then I don't need to go anywhere.」

％Ｂ
「Sora...」
Sora
「...I know that this is an important time for you, Ryou. So I don't want to get in your way.」

Sora
「...I know that this is an important time for you. So I don't want to get in your way.」

Sora
「...You helped me lots back when I was trying to think of a new show for the planetarium. So I want to help you lots too.」


Sora
「...If there's something I can do, I'll do it. Let me know if there's anything.」

％Ｂ
「...Thanks so much, Sora.」
I gently stroke her cheek.
％Ｂ
「It's enough for me that you're close by like this. It makes all my fatigue go away, and keeps me going.」

Sora
「...Ryou.」
She softly places her hand over my own on her cheek.
I kiss her.
Sora
「...Mh...nh... Nh...～～...mh...」
I slowly pull my lips away, and place my forehead against hers.
％Ｂ
「...I'm so glad you're here for me. Thank you.」
Sora
「...Ryou.」
Sora
「...Mm.」
％Ｂ
「...All right. I think I'll start with some breakfast, then.」
all
I pull my forehead away, sit back down on the couch, and open the lunchbox Sora brought for me.

％Ｂ
「Oh, today's looks great too. Let's dig in. Hamh... Mgmgh... Yeah, it's delicious!」

Sora
「...I'll make tea.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, thanks.」
Watching Sora from behind as she generously does what she can for me makes me so happy.\n\r

And so our rainy morning passes.
