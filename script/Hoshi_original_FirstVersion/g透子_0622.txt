％Ｂ
「What!? She's already here!?」
I'm here a half hour before the time we agreed on, but Yukimura's betrayed all expectations by being at our meet-up spot before me.

_00cutinBS
Crap. That's kinda uncool of me...
％Ｂ
「Sorry, did I make you wait?」
Touko
「No, I only just got here.」
It's a perfectly stereotypical exchange.
I never thought I'd get to experience this myself... not even in my dreams.
Touko
「Hehe, that was like something out of a manga just now. I didn't know people actually said things like that.」
％Ｂ
「Haha, I thought the same thing.」
We laugh together.
It may be tired and cliché in manga or TV, but it's a new experience for us.

％Ｂ
「When'd you get here?」
Touko
「Mmh... About nine, I think.」
％Ｂ
「That early!? That's an hour before our meet-up time! Why'd you get here so early!?」

Touko
「I couldn't help it... I woke up early. And I was too anxious to wait at home.」

Touko
「I was sure you'd come early too. That way... I'd get to see you a bit earlier.」

Hngh... Dammit! Dammit, that's too much, Yukimura...!
That exquisite blend of embarrassment and happiness!
Are you trying to give me a heart attack right after we meet up!?
Touko
「...? What's wrong?」
％Ｂ
「Nothing... I was just enjoying a man's happiness. Don't worry about it.」
Touko
「What the heck? I haven't even done anything.」
Such power, and it's completely unconscious.
Her smile's incredibly attractive, even considering any bias I may have from liking her.

I need to make sure to definitely show up first next time.
I need to let Yukimura experience this happiness too.
Touko
「Um, I have a request... Is that okay?」
％Ｂ
「Hm? A request?」
Touko
「Can we... hold hands?」
％Ｂ
「...That's a good idea. Since we're doing it over like the real deal.」
Touko
「Mhm. So... let's go?」
Her warm, small hand comes into contact with mine.
I've really gotten closer with her. I'm so happy.
Touko
「Ehehe, 
Ryousuke-kun, 

your hand... is so big.」
％Ｂ
「Hngh...!」
This is way too much joy for the beginning of our date!
Yukimura's being so assertive about being closer. I need to respond properly.\n\r

I'm gonna take all my pride as a man and channel it into maintaining my composure.
％Ｂ
「...Let's have fun today, Touko.」
all
％Ｂ
「Actually, I haven't eaten breakfast today. Wanna get something light?」
Touko
「Mhm, okay. There's still some time before lunch anyway.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, right, those crêpes from before were great. Wanna try getting some different flavors this time?」

Touko
「...Okay.」
％Ｂ
「Huh? What's wrong? Don't feel like crêpes right now?」

Touko
「N-No, I do. Um... I-I just remembered...」
％Ｂ
「Remembered? ...Oh.」
I realize what she must be thinking about.
She's probably talking about when she was messing around and wiped the cream off my face.

％Ｂ
「Y-You surprised me back then, you know that!? I had no idea what you were thinking!」

Touko
「S-Same for me...! I was able to do that back then because I was trying to tease you, but...!」



Touko
「Now... I think I might want to try something like that again.」
％Ｂ
「What!? S-Seriously!?」
Touko
「Because I want to redo the things we've done up until now. Though if you're really against it... then I won't.」

％Ｂ
「I-I'm not against it! All right, I'll go buy some, so just wait a minute!」

The way she said that was so unfair.
How could I not let her when she's pouting that cutely!?
_00cutinBS
Touko
「Oh, it's... Camera-chan.」
％Ｂ
「Huh? Oh, you're right. Heeey, Segawaaa!」

I wave at her.
_00cutinBS
She turns around when she hears my voice and waves back with a smile.
_00cutinBS
％Ｂ
「What are you up to?」
Natsuki
「I was getting maintenance done on my camera. I have to take care of my trusty partner, you know.」

She treasures her camera just like she treasures her photos.
I think it's really something to be admired.
Natsuki
「From the looks of things here... I guess things must've gone well. Thanks to my advice, right?」

％Ｂ
「...Well, I did appreciate your input.」
Natsuki
「Hey, that makes it sound like I wasn't much help at all! I gave you advice and that photo, didn't I!?」


Touko
「...Photo? What photo did she give you?」
％Ｂ
「Uhh... Well, I helped Segawa out with something a while back, and she gave me a photo of you as thanks.」

Touko
「What? I... don't remember ever having my photo taken.」
Natsuki
「You shouldn't underestimate me now. I wouldn't be a respectable grad-alb committee member if I let a shutter chance slip by me, would I?」


I think Segawa's passion for photography is amazing.
And I genuinely appreciate how natural Touko's expression was in the photo I got from her.

Natsuki
「I know, how about I take one of you two? It's hard to take a photo of the two of you together with a phone, right?」

％Ｂ
「Oh, you will? Then...」
Touko
「N-No! Wait a second!」
Natsuki
「Hm? Is there something wrong? Your hair looks nice, your makeup looks natural and nice... You look a lot cuter than usual today, Touko.」


...I bet Segawa would be crazy popular if she were a guy.
She's good at both photography and compliments. The ability to portray the subject's feelings is a must for a skilled photographer.

Touko
「...Um, because it's embarrassing.」
Natsuki
「I like it, you two are holding hands and everything! Myyy, this is the springtime of youth right here～!」

Touko
「Ah...!」
Natsuki
「Ahahah! Look at the two of you blush! Your faces are bright red!」

％Ｂ
「Leave us alone! It's even more embarrassing 'cause you're saying stuff like that!」

Natsuki
「It's my way of celebrating for you two. I'm just so happy things are going well.」

I'm genuinely happy she says so.
Segawa's really considerate of her friends.
Natsuki
「I like both your faces. C'mon, now just look this way and smile!」

Touko cautiously holds my hand again.
She turns toward Segawa's camera and gives a reserved smile.
Natsuki
「Okay! That was a good one! I'll send it to you two later!」

％Ｂ
「All right. Thanks, Segawa.」
Natsuki
「There's no need to thank... Oh, I know. Touko, could you let me take photos of you at some point? I only have a few of you, compared to everyone else.」

Touko
「...Mm. If I feel like it.」
Natsuki
「Ahaha, it's a promise, okay? See you later, then!」
She cheerfully goes running off.
She's always so restless, whether it's at school or otherwise.
％Ｂ
「You sure about that? Segawa's not gonna hold back on that kinda stuff.」
Touko
「...Mhm. Because I'm with you
, Ryousuke-kun

. I thought I should have something that lasts properly.」

％Ｂ
「All right, then let's make some lasting memories today too. Let's have a ton of fun today!」

Touko
「Yeah, let's do that!」
all
The day passes in the blink of an eye.
We're walking through the park at sundown, reluctant to part.

Touko
「Hey, wanna go to school together starting tomorrow? I'll come pick you up.」
％Ｂ
「Huh? Sure... but isn't that a lot of work?」
Touko
「It's fine, you don't live that far. We can be together in the mornings as well as after school that way, right?」


％Ｂ
「...Yeah. I'd feel bad if I just had you pick me up all the time, so I'll try to come up with something to do in return.」

Touko
「Mmm... Then let's eat lunch together too. I'll open up the old school building, so let's eat together in the usual room... alone.」

％Ｂ
「That sounds great. Let's spend more time together.」
I'm happy we're making more promises together.
Even the smallest promises are important parts of our relationship.

Touko
「Are you sad that we have to separate for today now... even though you know you'll see me again tomorrow?」

％Ｂ
「Of course I am. But it's a necessary thing.」
Touko
「Huh?」
％Ｂ
「There's still more ahead for us. There's tomorrow, the day after that... and past that too. There's still lots of fun for us to have from now on.」

％Ｂ
「I might feel a little lonely now, but that just means I'll be even happier when I see you tomorrow, right? We can be together for a long time thanks to this feeling.」


Touko
「...Mm. You're right.」
She squeezes my hand.
It's a sign of the loneliness she's feeling right now.
The more I fill up Touko's heart, the bigger the hole I'll open up in her from loneliness.
I need to do my best to keep that in mind and become able to support her through it.

％Ｂ
「You can call me whenever you want. Messaging's fine too. I'll do my best to make sure we can be connected for as long as possible.」


Touko
「Ahaha, I should seriously learn how to use this thing already. Oh, I know! Teach me more about how to use my phone sometime.」

％Ｂ
「...You've just been kinda zoning out all the other times, haven't you.」
Touko
「A-Ahahahaha...! Because I kiiinda didn't think I'd need it that much...! But I'll learn this time! I wanna send cute messages like Flower-chan does!」


％Ｂ
「Ah... You should have Shinozaki teach you stuff like that. I'm not too good at it.」

Touko
「Mmm... Okay. I'll try asking her.」
It wouldn't be good for Touko to only get closer to me.
I think she should become friends with Shinozaki and the others too, and start interacting with lots more people.

I want to become a bridge for Touko to expand her social circle.
I quietly vow to do my best for that too.
Touko
「It's... almost time to go home, isn't it?」
％Ｂ
「...You're right. We should probably get going.」
Touko
「...Yeah.」
Neither of us move.
Once we leave the park, all that's left to do is to go our separate ways.
Touko
「...Aren't you going to go home?」
％Ｂ
「...Same for you, Touko.」
We just stare into each other's eyes without moving.
We don't want today to end... We want to just stay here, together.
Touko
「Ahaha. This'll never end at this rate. We need to say our goodbyes for today. We'll be seeing each other again tomorrow anyway.」

％Ｂ
「...Yeah. Maybe... no, I'm sure tomorrow'll be even more fun.」
Touko
「Mhm. Then... Let's have our goodbye, okay?」
Touko wants a "goodbye."
The only thing I can think of for this situation is...
I turn back toward her.
I slowly reach out, and hold her by her shoulders. They're even more delicate and narrow than they look.
She's nervously waiting for me to make the next move.
Her long eyelashes and glossy lips tremble, just a bit.
Touko
「Mmh...!」
I slowly bring my face closer.
And I can feel something soft and damp on my lips for just an instant.
Touko
「...Wow. I didn't think it'd make my heart race so much.」
％Ｂ
「Haha, I was crazy nervous too.」
And my nervousness was outdone by happiness and fulfillment.
I doubt... I'll ever forget how good I feel right now, for as long as I live.
Touko
「...One more time.」
What a cute request.
It's not like I'm satisfied yet either. I want to do it for a little longer this time.

Touko
「Mm...」
I can clearly feel the softness of her lips.
All of my senses focus on my lips.
We've both stopped trembling. We have the presence of mind to enjoy our second kiss.

Touko
「Mmph... nh... chu...」
Touko's pressing her lips against mine too.
She places her hands lightly on my waist and pulls me closer.
More deeply. More intensely.
My hunger controls me, and I place my tongue between Touko's slightly opened lips.

Touko
「Mmh... nh...! Chu... slrp... mh... nnh...!」
She quivers in surprise, but immediately returns the favor.
Her tongue makes tiny wet sounds as she tangles it around mine.
She gets bolder and bolder.
Our second kiss isn't really a goodbye... It becomes a passionate act of showing how much we want each other.

Touko
「Mmh...! Geez, we won't be able to say goodbye... if you do things like this to me...」

％Ｂ
「...Sorry. I couldn't stop myself.」
Touko
「Ahaha, you're unexpectedly bad at that. You see... I also don't like to hold myself back.」

％Ｂ
「Really. Looks like we're both the same, then.」
Touko
「Mhm... Chu...chu... nnh...!」
We place our lips together again.
We hunger for each other, trying to fill the space between us that we haven't been able to until now.

We kissed over and over after that.
We couldn't bear to part until the shadows disappeared from the ground amidst the darkness of night.
I showed her just a bit how to use her phone as we were parting ways...
I wonder if she tried out a few things after that.
【％Ｂ】「How's it going? Figure #Nthings out a little?」
【Touko】「Not really that much #Nyet. I can type though.」
【％Ｂ】「Why don't you try using #Na stamp? It's quick and #Neasy.」
【Touko】「What's a stamp?」
【％Ｂ】「Like this.」
【％Ｂ】_st_0301
【Touko】「That's so cute! How do #Nyou do that?」
Oh, she's interested.
It's less work than typing out words, so this would probably be easier for her.

【％Ｂ】「It's getting pretty #Nlate, so I'll teach you #Ntomorrow.」
【Touko】「Okay. I'm sleepy too.」
【％Ｂ】「See you tomorrow then. #NNight.」
【Touko】「Night.」
