The seasons are changing.
The smell of summer's still present, but I've gradually begun to hear the footsteps of autumn approaching.

A new semester. One without Touko.
Other than that... my life hasn't changed compared to before the Tanabata Festival.

「...」
I can just barely hear the sounds of construction equipment on the wind.
They started to tear down the old school building a little before the start of the semester.
I may have been permitted entry before as a member of the event committee, but I can't go inside now.

The building's characteristic fragrance suddenly floats to mind.
A fragrance associated with my memories... My memories with Touko.
％Ｂ
「...Wish I could go inside again.」
It's sad... but there's nothing I can do.
I'm sure it'll be gone without a trace by the time the next Tanabata Festival comes around.
But even if the old school building disappears... it's not like my memories will too.

Those fun-filled, wonderful days... are etched deep into my heart.
％Ｂ
「...Maybe it's Touko.」
【Touko】「I went home with the #Ngirl who sits next to #Nme today.」
【Touko】「Her house was close to #Nmine. I think we'll get #Nalong.」
Touko's informing me of recent events.
Looks like she's making new connections like she said.
I'm relieved... but also a bit sad, maybe.
I type up a response while sorting through my conflicted feelings.
【％Ｂ】「That's great. Hope you #Ntwo become good friends.」
【Touko】_st_0301
【Touko】「She said she'd show me #Naround town after #Nschool tomorrow.」
【Touko】_st_0304
【Touko】「I'm already nervous.」
【％Ｂ】「Why don't you try #Nasking Shinozaki or #NSegawa about it?」
【％Ｂ】「I bet they'd give you #Ngood advice.」
【Touko】「Mhm, I'll try that.」
【Touko】「I'll report back #Ntomorrow!」
【Touko】_st_0309
I'm still reliant on this smartphone to connect with Touko.
I think the next time we see each other in person... might be winter break, at the earliest?
Touko's apparently planning on coming to Shionagi for university.
She promised me she'd come back here for sure after she graduated high school.
We won't be separated forever.
The two of us are both looking forward... We're walking toward the same future.

We're just... walking different paths for a tiny bit for now.
If we keep moving forward like this...
Then I know we'll be able to walk hand in hand again.
％Ｂ
「...The stars are starting to appear.」
The days grow shorter.
I wonder if Touko's looking up at the stars too right now.
The two of us are walking slowly.
Looking forward to the day we can look up at the stars at each other's sides.
We're walking forward... so we can greet each other with a smile when that day comes.
I reminisce on the days we spent together as I think that to myself.
