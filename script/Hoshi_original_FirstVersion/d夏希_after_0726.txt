「Nh... Nnhh～ ...Nh?」
I don't see Natsuki next to me when I wake up.
I walk into the living room to find her already changed and getting ready to go.

％Ｂ
「Right, you've got work today.」
Natsuki
「Mhm, we have a photo shoot of a baby first thing in the morning.」
％Ｂ
「Pretty rough for a Sunday.」
Natsuki
「I'm sorry we can't be together on your day off.」
％Ｂ
「It's fine. Can't do anything about work. I'll do the housework, so no need to worry.」
Natsuki
「Thanks. But I think I'll be done by around four today, so I'll get groceries for dinner on my way home.」

％Ｂ
「All right. That'd be great.」
Natsuki
「I'm going, then. Mmm... chu♪ I'm off!」


％Ｂ
「Yep, do your best.」
all
％Ｂ
「All right... Let's eat some breakfast and get at that housework.」
％Ｂ
「Phew... This should be good.」
I did laundry in the morning, ate lunch by myself, and then cleaned up around the house in the afternoon.

It takes a lot more time on my own.
It's already 3 p.m.
％Ｂ
「We'll need to pick up some laundry detergent soon. And we're almost out of trash bags too...」

％Ｂ
「There's an hour until Natsuki's done with work... She can pick that stuff up on her way back if I contact her now.」

I start up LIME.
％Ｂ
「Hm... Wait a second.」
An hour's more than enough time to go to Natsuki's studio.
What if I secretly went to go pick her up, as a surprise?
Wonder if she'd like that.
％Ｂ
「...All right. Let's go pick her up for once.」
Natsuki works at that studio where we got the constellation photos developed back in high school.

I never really go there that often, since the supermarket and drugstore are in the opposite direction.

％Ｂ
「Man, it's been a while...」
I know where to go, since I went to go pick her up several times back when I was in university.

The studio's got a show window in the front with lots of different photos on display.

Girls dressed in Shichi-Go-San attire.
A boy with a big backpack on his first day of school.
A family photo spanning four generations, from great-grandfather to great-grandson.
Grade schoolers carrying batons as they run a relay race for field day.
A ballet dancer in the middle of her routine.\n\r
Masses of students passionately cheering on the teams at Koushien.
There are family photos, wedding photos, snapshots, scenery, and sports shots you can just feel the motion from.

％Ｂ
「So these are all Nishioka-sensei's work... I get it.」
I'm a complete amateur when it comes to photography, but if I were to call most photos stuff like "good" and "pretty," then Nishioka-sensei's are all "wonderful."


It's kinda like "good" and "pretty" don't exactly describe them. There's a little something more to these photos.\n\r

Maybe "charming" is a good word.
％Ｂ
「I get why Natsuki's always so quick to praise her.」

％Ｂ
「...Oh!」
I spot some familiar photos alongside Nishioka-sensei's.
％Ｂ
「These are Natsuki's.」
They're the photos of that family she took when we went to the park the other day.
％Ｂ
「Wow, so she got them put up on display. That's great for her.」
The child beaming as he plays with his father.
Him looking immensely curious as he approaches the camera.
And the three of them smiling together as a family with the sea behind them.
％Ｂ
「Hm... These are pretty good.」
It's not as much as from Nishioka-sensei's, but I think I can feel the same "wonderfulness" from Natsuki's photos too.

％Ｂ
「...Or maybe I'm just biased.」
There are also photos of a bride in her wedding dress and her groom in a tuxedo.

They're just standing normally in some, having fun posing in others, and there's even one of them kissing.

％Ｂ
「This would be kinda embarrassing...」
But I'm also a bit jealous...
Natsuki
「Great work today! I'll be leaving now!」
The door opens, and Natsuki steps out.
％Ｂ
「Natsuki.」
Natsuki
「Huh? Wait, 
Ryousuke
what
!? What are you doing here? You didn't come to pick me up, did you?」

％Ｂ
「I did. Figured I might as well take a walk and go shopping.」
Natsuki
「Listen to you～ You sure it's not just because you wanted to see me sooner? Mmhehe～♪」

She grabs hold of my arm.
％Ｂ
「Hey, calm down...」
Natsuki
「Thanks for coming to pick me up. I'm really happy!」
Seeing her say that with that radiant smile's making me happy too.
I'm definitely glad I came.
Natsuki
「Did you wait long?」
％Ｂ
「No, I just got here. I was looking at the photos out front.」
Natsuki
「Oh, hey, did you notice my photos were up on display?」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, I saw them. It's great that Nishioka-sensei's acknowledged you like that.」
Natsuki
「Eheheeeh, yeeep. I'm still nowhere near her level, though. Were there any photos that caught your eye?」

％Ｂ
「Let me think... Oh yeah, these wedding ones.」
Natsuki
「Oh yeah, these are great, aren't they? It's like you can feel their happiness from just looking. It's a full-course meal.」


％Ｂ
「Yeah, I can feel the happiness. Though I was thinking it'd be just a bit embarrassing for me... Are these the kinda photos you want?」


Natsuki
「Would you cooperate if I said they were? Like for a kiss photo.」

％Ｂ
「A kiss photo, huh? ...Well, if you really wanted to...」
Natsuki
「Ahaha, reallyyy?」
％Ｂ
「Y-Yeah...」
But spare me the embarrassment of having them displayed in the studio's show window like this...

all
Nishioka
「I thought I heard your voice. Hello there, Mr. Husband.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, hello, Nishioka-sensei. Thank you very much for all you've done for Natsuki.」
Nishioka
「Did you come here to pick up your wife from work? You two sure are in love.」
Natsuki
「Aw, geez, stop it, Senseeei!」
Nishioka-sensei's as easygoing and playful as ever.
all
Nishioka
「By the way, I heard from Natsuki that you two still haven't taken your wedding photos.」

Nishioka
「Why don't you come take them at our studio sometime? You can rent a dress, and I'll give you an employee discount.」

Natsuki
「Sensei, it'd be nice if you could make it free instead.」

Nishioka
「I'll make it free if you work for free for a day.」
Natsuki
「Really!? All right! We'll get to do it for free!」
％Ｂ
「Calm down. That just means she doesn't have to pay you for the day's work.」
Natsuki
「...Gasp! You're right!」
all
Nishioka
「I would've gotten away with it clean if Mr. Husband weren't here... Anyway, jokes aside, what do you think? You should take photos to celebrate milestones like that.」


％Ｂ
「Uhh... We're very grateful for the offer, but...」
Natsuki
「I've decided that I'd only wear the dress for the ceremony.」
Nishioka
「What? I don't remember you two having a ceremony planned.」
％Ｂ
「We... don't yet. We were going to have one once we had saved up some more money.」

Nishioka
「I see. Then I'll be your cameraman for the ceremony when it happens.」

Natsuki
「Wha, really!? We'd love that!」
Nishioka
「Leave it to me. I'll put in some good work for the sake of my adorable little employee. At a reasonable price.」

％Ｂ
「So you're sticking to that...」
Nishioka
「It's still business to me, after all. I won't be able to pay Natsuki otherwise.」

Natsuki
「That would be a problem! 
Ryousuke, we're 
We're 
going to pay her, okay!?」
％Ｂ
「We will, but...」
I wonder if she understands that the money she'd be paying is also coming out of her own paycheck...

all
We're walking home with our shopping bags, holding hands.
％Ｂ
「By the way, what happened with that photography contest?」
Natsuki
「Oh, right! I have to tell you! I've finally figured out what I'm going for!」

％Ｂ
「Hohoh.」
The theme of the contest is "smiles."
Natsuki's taken tons of photos of smiles until now, but to be honest, none of them really struck a chord with me.

Natsuki herself was apparently lost on what kind of photo she actually wanted to take, but it looks like she's finally figured something out.

Natsuki
「When people smile, there's always something or someone that made them smile, right?」

Natsuki
「It varies from person to person, but if you ask me, I think it's "friends."」

％Ｂ
「Friends?」
Natsuki
「Yeah, friends. You have friends who make you smile, friends who smile, and when they smile, all of your other friends end up smiling too... I think I wanna try taking a picture of a chain of smiles like that.」


％Ｂ
「So where there's a smile, there's always a friend who made it happen in the first place.」
I get it. Yeah, that'd definitely be a photo with a message.
％Ｂ
「So how are you actually gonna take the photo?」
Natsuki
「I've got an idea of a time and place where I might find tons of smiles like that. I'm thinking I'll take photos there.」

％Ｂ
「A time and place?」
Natsuki
「Yep. I'm planning on taking photos there on the 6th next month.」
％Ｂ
「So that's August 6th.」
August 6th...
％Ｂ
「Oh... Are you talking about Shionagi Academy's Tanabata Festival?」
Natsuki
「Ding diiing♪ You've got it!」
She's right. That time, that place was definitely overflowing with our friends' smiles.\n\r

In a way you could call it Natsuki's... no, our starting point.
％Ｂ
「I get it. I hope you get some good photos.」
Natsuki
「Mhm! I've got this!」
She nods emphatically and smiles.
And her smile makes me smile too.
