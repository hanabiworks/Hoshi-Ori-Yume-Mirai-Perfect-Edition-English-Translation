「―That concludes my thoughts on the matter.」
It's Saturday, but I'm at school.
So are Segawa and the members of the event committee, including Narusawa.

We're meeting to discuss the preparations for the Tanabata Festival.
It was pretty tough negotiating with the involved parties and figuring things out for this while I was trying to recruit Narusawa at the same time.

all
Misa
「I see, I see. A collaborative display for nature in Shionagi.」
％Ｂ
「Yes. I was thinking of what commonalities there are between the astronomy and naturalist clubs, and the first thing I thought of was nature.」

％Ｂ
「Shionagi's beach is a popular tourist location, and we're famous for being able to see the stars well. What do you think?」

Misa
「Yes. I think it sounds very wonderful!」
Okihara-senpai seems pretty excited.
all
I've proposed a plan for a collaborative display for the sea and stars.\n \n\r
We'll put Okihara-senpai's jellyfish on display, as well as actually go to the sea and collect fish and other marine wildlife.

We won't be able to gather too many, since we have to consider the space we'll have, so we'll have to make do with just display photos for some species.

I've already secured Segawa's expertise for the photography.
％Ｂ
「What do you think, Ousaka?」
The other half of my idea was to make a sphere out of wire and small light bulbs, attach paper to it, and use that to project the heavens on the ceiling.

We should be able to get some pretty good projections once we fine-tune the number and color of light bulbs.

Sora
「No issues.」
％Ｂ
「Thanks.」
Sora
「But there's one thing.」
％Ｂ
「Hm? What's that?」
I'm pretty sure I thought this through pretty well, but I guess there's still an issue somewhere.
Ousaka points at a sentence in my design documents.
Sora
「Planets don't emit light. Only by reflecting the light from the enormous amount of gas produced by the nuclear fusion process at the core of a nearby star do they―」

％Ｂ
「I get that you're trying to be factually correct, but if we could just look past that for the sake of prioritizing an impressive display...!」
Sora
「Mmh... Roger that.」
all
She still looks unsatisfied, but she drops it.
％Ｂ
「So I know it's sudden, but how about we go catch fish tomorrow?」
Rikka
「That soon? Wouldn't that be inefficient? We'd have to keep them alive until the festival.」

％Ｂ
「That's exactly why. You're right that there wouldn't be any issues with catching them right before the festival.」
％Ｂ
「And of course, I think that'd be easier for us too.」
％Ｂ
「But if we're gonna do a display, then I think it'd be a good idea for us all, not just Okihara-senpai, to know more about the fish too.」

％Ｂ
「So I figured it'd be easier to do that if we were raising them.」
Marika
「I think that sounds good～ I agree with him.」
all
Natsuki
「Sounds fun.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
all
Misa
「I am also very much in agreement! Rikka-san, would you also like to try it with us?」

Okihara-san grabs Narusawa's hands tightly and turns a bright smile toward her.

Rikka
「Hgh... It was just a question that came to mind. I'm not against it.」
％Ｂ
「Okihara-senpai. You said you were raising things other than jellyfish before, didn't you? Do you still have the tanks from back then?」

all
Misa
「Yes. I still have several left over in the preparation room.」
％Ｂ
「Let's use those for the display, then.」
all
％Ｂ
「So about all of your plans for tomorrow...」
Sora
「I'm free.」

Misa
「I also have time.」
all
Marika
「I don't have work, so of course I'll go.」

Rikka
「No issues for me.」
all
Natsuki
「Ahh, I need to go take photos of the baseball game tomorrow...」
％Ｂ
「Okay. We'll just have to get the photos next time, then.」
I doubt we'd be able to catch everything we want on just one trip anyway. And I was planning on mostly just surveying tomorrow, so next time works too.

all
％Ｂ
「Let's split up into two groups for tomorrow. Three people to catch fish, and two people to prepare the tanks.」

％Ｂ
「Okihara-senpai, may I count on you to be on the fish-catching team? We don't know what kinds of fish to display.」

Misa
「I understand.」
％Ｂ
「I'll also be on the fish-catching team.」
％Ｂ
「We'll have to put the fish in cooler boxes filled with seawater and take them back with us like that, so I should be there, since I'm the lone male.」

Natsuki
「You sure you aren't saying that 'cause you wanna be alone together with Misa-san～?」
all
Rikka
「...」
％Ｂ
「I said three people for catching fish, didn't I?」
all
Rikka
「I'll come catch fish too.」
％Ｂ
「What? Really?」
Rikka
「Do you have a problem with that?」
％Ｂ
「No, it's just I never really thought of you as much of an outdoors person.」
％Ｂ
「You sure? I think it'll be pretty rough footing and stuff.」
Rikka
「That won't cause me any issues.」
all
％Ｂ
「All right, then Narusawa's on the fish-catching team too. Can I count on you two to prepare the fish tanks, then?」

Sora
「...*nod*」
Marika
「Mhm. We'll get them ready and wait for you guys to bring the fish.」
The two of them nod in response.
I know I can count on Shinozaki, since she's always been dependable.
all
Natsuki
「This is looking like it'll be interesting～ It's such a shame I won't be able to come along to take pictures～」
