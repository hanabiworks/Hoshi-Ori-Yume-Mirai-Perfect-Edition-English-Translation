I'm doing miscellaneous tasks in the event committee office.
But I'm being pretty inefficient. I can't seem to stop thinking about Yukimura.

％Ｂ
「Sigh...」
Shuuichi
「...How many times is that now? You're gonna put mold on the walls with all that sighing.」

％Ｂ
「Shut uuuup. I've got stuff worth sighing over.」
Shuuichi
「Seriously... Hey, wanna have a match for a change of pace?」
％Ｂ
「What? Why now?」
Shuuichi
「Because we weren't able to really settle the score for our PK shootout before because of Segawa. Let's have ourselves a good, serious match for once.」

％Ｂ
「Sure... but what about work?」
Shuuichi
「It's fine. People aren't gonna complain if we take a bit of a break.」

Shuuichi
「Hup, hoh...! I've still got my glasses on... but whatever...!」
％Ｂ
「Still, though... What's this for? Why'd you wanna have a match out of nowhere like this?」
Shuuichi
「You've... got something... on your mind, right...!? Getting some exercise is the best thing... in times like these!」

...So he was being considerate of me.
I'm grateful. I'll be serious about this match.
％Ｂ
「Pass me the ball. I wanna hit it around a bit first too.」
Shuuichi
「Oh, you're gonna get serious? Sure thing... Here!」
all
％Ｂ
「I'm not that great... at juggling the ball, so...!」
Shuuichi
「Yeah, right. You're better at it than I am.」
％Ｂ
「That was back... when we were kids...! I don't think... we're too different... now...!」

I tap the ball into the air a few times, pop it up high, and catch it in both hands.
It's like I thought back when I played futsal the other day. My body still remembers everything.

Shuuichi
「All right, let's get started, then. You fine starting with me on offense and you on defense?」

％Ｂ
「Sure thing. Gotta give you at least some kinda handicap, right?」
Shuuichi
「As if. Don't come crying to me afterward, all right? Let's start by seeing how we measure up!」

all
％Ｂ
「Hahh... Hahh...! Dammit!」
I know all of Shuuichi's tells. His habits when he's about to shoot, what it feels like when he's about to feint, the rhythm of his steps.
Or at least I thought I knew all that.
Shuuichi
「What's wrong!? You're getting left in the dust!」
％Ｂ
「Kh...!」
He's feinting to the right.
I know what he's doing, but I can't help but flinch right on reflex. I know I need to move the other direction, but my body's frozen up.

all
％Ｂ
「Hah...gh... hahhh...!」
Shuuichi
「Oh, looks like... you're getting a little better...!? Then... how about this!?」

％Ｂ
「Hgh!? Dammit!」
He hits it with his left leg. The opposite from what I was expecting.
I start toward the right, but I'm one step too late to stop it.
My vision's narrowing. My body feels heavy.
I can remember the way I used to move, but I can't go through the motions the way I want to.

all
Shuuichi
「Phew... That one was pretty close. I need to get the feel of this back more.」

％Ｂ
「I'm not done yet...! I'm not done until I stop at least one...!」
Shuuichi
「All right! I'm cool with doing this for a bit longer!」
％Ｂ
「I'm not gonna make it easy!」
all
Shuuichi moves back and forth, over and over.
He feints with scissors moves to try to confuse me as he slowly, but surely closes the distance.

Shuuichi
「All right... How about this!?」
He pulls his right leg back hard.
Is he gonna send it flying, or is he gonna start dribbling it forward for a sprint battle!?
％Ｂ
「...Gh!」
I react to his movements, but they were a feint.
He places his right foot lightly on top of the ball and taps it with the inside of his foot―neatly between my legs.

％Ｂ
「Dammit!」
I react in desperation as he starts to move past me.\n \n\r

And that reaction is―to reach out with my hand without thinking.
Shuuichi
「Agh!」
I grab Shuuichi's clothes. He loses his balance and falls.
It's a clear foul.
％Ｂ
「S-Sorry! You all right!?」
Shuuichi
「Ow, ow...! Yeah, I'm fine.」
I pull him up from the ground.
It doesn't look like he's hurt... but I still feel bad.
Shuuichi
「Can't do a play like that just now. That's a yellow card.」
％Ｂ
「...My bad. It wasn't on purpose...」
Shuuichi
「You're holding back, aren't you? Come at me harder, man.」
％Ｂ
「Wha...?」
Shuuichi
「Even if you foul hard enough to get a card, you're still allowed to get one yellow card and still play, right? It's not like you to be so timid from the start.」


％Ｂ
「Shuuichi...」
Shuuichi
「Though if you're gonna push anyone down, do it to a girl. Don't be too rough when that happens, you hear?」

％Ｂ
「...The hell are you talking about, you idiot?」
My heart feels lighter.
I feel like my field of view's expanded. I can see more clearly.
If it's one yellow card, then it's just a "warning."
I won't be able to break out if I'm timid right from the start!
Shuuichi
「Right, let's do this! This is the last one...!」
％Ｂ
「Yeah! Come at me!」
Shuuichi
「O-Ohh...!?」
I close the distance in one spurt, slam myself against him, and swipe at his ankles with my feet.\n\r

I'm not gonna give him room for his footwork!
％Ｂ
「How's... this...!?」
Shuuichi
「That's more like you...! But it's not gonna be that easy!」

all
He pulls the ball back with his right foot and creates distance between us.
This is a trap.
He's probably assuming I'll force myself back in, and he'll use the opportunity to slide the ball to either the left or the right.

Is it gonna go left? Or right?
Even Shuuichi isn't dextrous enough to pop the ball up in this situation, so it's down to those two options.

％Ｂ
「Gh...!」
I purposefully keep myself to the right as I approach.
all
Shuuichi moves the ball to the left in response.
Shuuichi
「Whoa...!?」
And now I throw myself all at once toward the ball, and reach out with my leg―!
Shuuichi
「Hahh... Hahh... C-Come on... That last play was a second yellow card!」

％Ｂ
「Hah... Hah...! As if! The ball was completely clear... You're the one... who kneed me in the leg...!」


Shuuichi
「It's an overwhelming victory for me in total score...! I should've... decided on a penalty game...!」

％Ｂ
「I'll... win for sure next time...! I saw all of your tricks... today...!」

Shuuichi
「Hup... okay. How do you feel? Refreshed?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. I feel like I might be able to come up with something good, thanks to you.」
Shuuichi
「I see. That's good, then. All right, I'm gonna go back to the committee office... How about you?」

％Ｂ
「Just a second. I wanna ask you about something first.」
Shuuichi
「Hm? About what?」
％Ｂ
「About your girlfriend. Tell me about her.」
Shuuichi
「Excuse me!? Wh-Why do I have to tell you about her!?」

％Ｂ
「It's for future... No, it's all for the sake of bettering the event committee!」

Shuuichi
「You're not making any sense! How are those two things connected!?」

％Ｂ
「I like Yukimura! So I'm gonna confess to her and get her to date me and join the event committee!」

Shuuichi
「...Wha?」
％Ｂ
「So I'm gonna take your experiences into account for that. That's why you need to tell me something good.」

Shuuichi
「That's a rough way of asking... But sure, sounds interesting. All right, I'll help. What do you wanna hear?」

％Ｂ
「...Well, actually... This'll be my first time confessing to someone.」
Shuuichi
「Sure. And?」
％Ｂ
「To be honest... I don't really know how to phrase things. I've been told to either go upfront and leave it to momentum or create a good mood and stuff... but how do you actually do it?」


Shuuichi
「It's gonna depend on the situation, obviously. I guess just telling her "I like you!" upfront would work the best?」


Shuuichi
「Listen up. You get close to her like this... and look her right in the eyes and go, "Senpai, I like you! Please go out with me!" Like that.」


Female Student A
「Did you hear that just now!? "Senpai," he said...! Is that the kind of stuff they're into!?」

Female Student B
「I always thought those two were suspicious! We need to tell everyone!」

Female Student A
「I feel like he'd punish Nirasawa-kun lots if he caught him looking at other men!」

Female Student B
「I totally get that too! I'm so glad the boys wear neckties as part of the uniform here! Nirasawa-kun's definitely the type to get his necktie pulled, right!?」

...Huh. Those girls over there seem strangely excited.
I'm hearing disturbing words like "other men" and "get his necktie pulled" from them, but they're not...!

Shuuichi
「...Wait a second. Wouldn't other people think I'm confessing to you if they saw this?」

％Ｂ
「That's exactly what they're thinking! This isn't what you think, all right!? Who the hell would wanna go out with this shady-looking four-eyed freak!?」

Shuuichi
「The hell did you say!? As if you're one to talk! And I don't like you assuming that you're the one who's choosing here!」

％Ｂ
「'Course I freakin' am! Come back once you've been reborn as a pretty girl!」

Shuuichi
「Right back at you! Why the hell do I have to date a dude!?」

Female Student A
「It's a lovers' fight! We're already full, but here's dessert!」

Female Student B
「Can I take a video of this!? This is too good for just us to enjoy! I want everyone to see this!」

all
％Ｂ
「Of course not! Don't point your phones at us!」

Shuuichi
「Retreat! Retreat! Dammit, we should've done this somewhere without any other people...!」

Female Student A
「Somewhere without any other people!? Oh god, what are they going to do!?」
Female Student B
「They're gonna get all passionate together! I'm sure it'll be like, "Sorry about that just now"!」

I don't think we can take this any longer...!
Our hearts might be about to break...!
all
I'll try charging in a bit forcefully.
You have to move a bit selfishly if you wanna score a goal.
Now that I think about it... I've been giving too much priority to Yukimura's feelings and convenience.
I might have to get more forceful for things to work.
％Ｂ
「I'll need to make sure not to give her too much space... It'll just be the same as before if she just dodges away.」

I'm thinking in terms of soccer, probably because of my match with Shuuichi.\n\r

It's kinda fun, so I might as well keep going like this.
％Ｂ
「I'll push her to the sides... kinda like a surround. Let's say my feelings are gonna be the frontal attack. If I could find some way to pressure her from the side at the same time...」


I wanna go for a pincer attack.
There's the event committee and there's the subject of the old school building being opened up.
I'll use the current situation to my advantage.
％Ｂ
「I think I'll be able to get through... if I could link my pressure together...」

Yukimura's been able to dodge me so far because I've been doing everything separately.\n\r

It'd be great if I could consolidate everything together...
％Ｂ
「...I know!」
I've got an idea.
An idea incorporating my feelings and the old school building.\n\r
I might be able to solve everything in one fell swoop with this.
But... the results will be up to how Yukimura feels.
All I can do is communicate my feelings with everything I've got.\n\r
I can just do my due diligence to pick up the pieces afterward.
％Ｂ
「It's gonna come down to... tomorrow after school.」
【％Ｂ】「I'll see you tomorrow #Nafter school, in the old #Nschool building.」
