And so...
Shionagi First Academy's Tanabata Festival begins.
％Ｂ
「We will be allowing everyone through in about ten more minutes! Please wait for just a little longer!」

$$smh_OpenCHK
Marika
「Once the doors open, please move forward slowly from the front. Please don't run, for your safety.」

Shinozaki and I are doing event committee work to manage the festival gates.
％Ｂ
「Phew... There's a ton of people.」
Marika
「There are～ It looks like there are lots of people who are treating this as a pre-festival for the city's festival the day after tomorrow.」


all
We aren't allowing people in yet, but there's a huge mass of local residents gathered in front of the school gates.\n\r

There are lots of families and kids here too, since it's summer break.
％Ｂ
「...Huh?」
I spot a familiar face in the crowd.
％Ｂ
「Sorry, Shinozaki. Could you handle this by yourself for a bit?」
Marika
「Yeah, that's okay.」
all
I walk over.
％Ｂ
「Okihara-san.」
Misa's Father
「Well hello. Let's see... Hino-kun, right?」
Misa's Father
「Well hello!」
％Ｂ
「Good morning. So you came.」
Misa's Father
「Since this is going to be my daughter's last Tanabata Festival.」
Misa's Father
「And I did play a minor part in the "sea full of stars" too, so I've been looking forward to seeing it completed.」


％Ｂ
「Thank you so very much for your help back then.」
Misa's Father
「No, no... Oh, I'll introduce you two. She's family.」

She's family... Which means... she's Misa-senpai's mom!?
％Ｂ
「Pleased to meet you. My name is ％Ａ ％Ｂ.」
Misa's Mother
「Pleased to meet you. I'm Misa's mother. I've heard so much about you already.」

％Ｂ
「H-Have you?」
Misa's Mother
「Misa always looks like she's having so much fun when she talks about you. She never made faces like that about anything other than fish before.」


Misa's Father
「Come on now. That makes it sound like you're saying he's the same as fish.」

Misa's Mother
「Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it that way.」
％Ｂ
「Oh no, it's an honor to be told that.」
Misa's Father
「Hahaha, seems you're a little eccentric too.」
Misa's Mother
「Ufufu. You're a funny boy.」
Oh... She laughs the same way Misa-senpai does.
Misa's Father
「The truth is, we haven't told Misa that we'd be coming today.」
％Ｂ
「What? Really?」
Misa's Father
「Misa's been depressed lately, so we assumed something had happened with the aquarium. We were worried, so we've been watching over her.」


Misa's Father
「We thought something might have gone wrong.」
％Ｂ
「Oh... Well...」
Marika
「It's almost time to let people in～!」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, got it! I'll be right there!」
％Ｂ
「I apologize, Okihara-san. I have to go.」
Misa's Father
「Okay. See you, then.」
％Ｂ
「Please excuse me.」
I didn't think I'd end up meeting Misa-senpai's mom here...
％Ｂ
「All right, let's start the festival!」
Marika
「Shionagi First Academy's Tanabata Festival will now begin!」
all
The crowd of people starts moving through the gate.
％Ｂ
「Good morning. Please don't run, for your safety.」

A huge crowd moves past us.
I nod at Okihara-san and his wife as they pass.
I wonder what they'll think when they see the aquarium?
Shuuichi
「Hey, Shinozaki! Ryousuke!」
Shuuichi
「Hey, you two!」
％Ｂ
「Hey, Shuuichi.」
Shuuichi
「You can go over to the naturalist club now.」
％Ｂ
「You sure?」
Shuuichi
「You don't need to be here now that the festival's started. You should go help out with the aquarium instead.」

all
Marika
「Thanks, Nirasawa-kun. Let's go!」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, let's go!」
％Ｂ
「Whoa...?」
We're on the way to the display... and I'm taken aback slightly when I spot from the window how many people there are in the old school building.

％Ｂ
「There's a lot of people in the old school building. Is there something else in there today...?」

Marika
「Hmm, Nirasawa-kun didn't mention anything like that...」
％Ｂ
「Right?」
I can't believe there are this many people here...
Marika
「Huh? But everyone's lined up there. It's...」

％Ｂ
「So all of these people are there for the aquarium, then?」

Marika
「Looks like it...」
％Ｂ
「...Seriously?」
Rikka
「Welcome. Please take your time here.」
Narusawa's in charge of the reception.
Marika
「Narusawa-san!」
Rikka
「Oh, you two. Are you done with your event committee work?」
Marika
「Nirasawa-kun said we could come help here.」
Rikka
「I see. That's good.」
％Ｂ
「H-Hey... Are these people all here to come see the "sea full of stars"?」

Rikka
「What else would people come here for?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, but... I didn't think this many people'd come.」
Rikka
「But you're the one who asked them to.」
％Ｂ
「Huh? I did?」
Rikka
「You said before that you asked grade school teachers if they'd come with that survey.」

Rikka
「Almost all of them said they'd recommend their students to come, right?」

％Ｂ
「Oh... So that means...」
Rikka
「With this many children here, I guess they must have actually ended up doing that.」

Marika
「I'm sure that's it～! They all said on the survey that aquariums are a great educational aid too!」


Rikka
「So that's more or less the same as you asking them to come, right?」
％Ｂ
「Is that how it works...?」
I'd be real happy if that's true...
Rikka
「Shinozaki-san, could you help me out here?」
Marika
「Okay, got it!」
％Ｂ
「Okay then, I'll leave this up to you two. I'm gonna go take a look inside.」

％Ｂ
「Oh man... You're kidding me...」
There's a ton of people watching the fish in the classroom.
I spot Segawa taking photos of it all from the side.
％Ｂ
「This is a ton of people.」
Natsuki
「I know, right? I'll be honest, I didn't think this many would come.」

％Ｂ
「Ditto.」
Natsuki
「It's great that the tanks made it in time.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah.」
all
The tanks are beautifully clear.
We waited patiently and believed... and the clouding had disappeared without a trace when we checked last night.

％Ｂ
「We really cut it close, though.」
Natsuki
「I can't believe doing nothing was the best option. I didn't even think it could be an option at all. Though, well, Misa-san's really something for going through with that as a plan.」


％Ｂ
「I think... it was 'cause she believed that it would definitely make it in time. She was able to believe in herself... and in everything we've done so far.」


Natsuki
「Hmm. That makes sense. Well aren't you the expert when it comes to her, Mr. Boyfriend?」


％Ｂ
「G-Guess so, yeah.」
Natsuki
「And believing turned out to be the right choice. Everyone's really impressed. Especially the kids, they love it.」


％Ｂ
「Where's Misa-senpai?」
Natsuki
「She's doing a fish seminar over there.」
％Ｂ
「A fish seminar?」
all
She's giving a passionate lecture on the fish to some kids in front of some of the tanks.

Misa
「Now everyone, this cute little fish here is called a yellowtail wrasse.」

Girl A
「Grass?」
Misa
「Wrasse. Wrasse, with a W-R!」
Misa
「Adult yellowtail wrasses look completely different from when they're little. I have some photos here, so let's all compare them together.」


Misa
「He may be orange right now, as you can see, but once he gets bigger... Wow, now there's stars! Here, please take a look!」


％Ｂ
「Just when did she find the time to make that flipbook...?」
But the kids love it.
I guess it's always better to show them directly.
all
Misa's Father
「Hahaha... She's always so passionate when it comes to talking about fish.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, Okihara-san...」
Misa's Mother
「I'm sure you have it hard too.」
％Ｂ
「Oh no, not at all.」
Misa's Father
「It's turned out to be a wonderful aquarium. It's genuinely inspiring.」

Misa's Mother
「Were you the one who had the idea of combining the constellations with the fish tanks?」

％Ｂ
「It wasn't just me. All of us participating thought of it together.」
Misa's Mother
「So you all worked together to make this. How wonderful.」
％Ｂ
「That girl over there's the mastermind behind these constellations. She's from the astronomy club, so she knows a lot.」

Ousaka's teaching some kids about the constellations.
Boy A
「Hey, what's this constellation called?」
Sora
「...This is Cancer.」
Boy A
「Cancer! It's my constellation! I'm a Cancer!」
Sora
「...Once upon a time, the goddess Hera, Zeus's wife, released a monstrous crab in order to kill Hercules, who was the son of one of Zeus's lovers.」


Sora
「...The crab tried to cut Hercules' legs, but Hercules stepped on it without ever realizing. After seeing that, Hera placed that crab in the heavens.」


Sora
「And that crab became Cancer.」
...What on earth is she talking about?
Boy A
「Wow... Cool...」
And he's just eating it up...
Though I guess kids really like mythology and stuff.
all
Misa's Father
「I think the fish and the constellations are wonderful. But I think that might be what's most holding my interest.」

He points at... the model of Marinpia Shionagi that's being displayed in a corner of the room.

Misa's Father
「I didn't think I'd see something like this here. It's very well made.」

Misa's Mother
「I was surprised too. Did you borrow that from the architect, Azuma-san?」

％Ｂ
「No, I was the one who made that.」
Misa's Father
「Wha... You made that!?」
％Ｂ
「Yes. I learned how to make models during an internship in the past.」

％Ｂ
「I borrowed the blueprints from Azuma-san and tried recreating it.」
Misa's Father
「Now that's a shock... You made that elaborate model? It made me think of the days back when Marinpia had just started up. It's wonderful work!」


％Ｂ
「Thank you very much! I'm very happy to hear that from the director of the actual institution!」


This makes me the happiest, even more than having the fish or the constellations complimented and appreciated.


Misa's Father
「And so I assume you're aiming to be an architect in the future, then?」
％Ｂ
「Yes, I'm intending to.」
Misa's Father
「Hm... Being the wife of an architect isn't a bad future for Misa.」
％Ｂ
「Uh...」
Misa's Mother
「Now dear. You're making it difficult for him to respond. I'm sorry about that.」

％Ｂ
「Oh, it's fine... Hahaha...」
That made me freeze up a bit.
Lots of other people were interested in the Marinpia model after that too.
Everyone seemed to regret it closing down, and lots of them talked about their memories of the place as they looked at the model.

％Ｂ
「...I'm glad I made it.」
And I'm so glad that everything worked out in the end for this aquarium too.
There were some issues, but we were able to make it through. It's all thanks to everyone's help.\n\r

It would've been impossible for sure with just Misa-senpai and me.
Shinozaki helped out as a fellow event committee member, and Ousaka abandoned her own club's display to help the naturalist club.


Segawa helped out while she was also busy with grad-alb committee work, and Narusawa and Yukimura both did a lot to help out, even though I kinda dragged them into this against their will.


I'm genuinely glad that all of us were able to create this "sea full of stars," together.

Touko
「Oh, there you are. Do you have a second?」
Yukimura walks over to me while I'm appreciating everything that's happened.
％Ｂ
「What's up?」
Touko
「There's someone here for you.」
％Ｂ
「For me?」
Touko
「Him. That guy standing over there.」
all
％Ｂ
「...Oh! Teacher! You came!」
Azuma
「Hey. I told you I'd come to see, didn't I?」
％Ｂ
「But Teacher, I figured you'd just be sleeping at the firm again because you've been busy with work.」

Azuma
「You know, you're just so... And don't call me "Teacher" in a place like this.」
％Ｂ
「But you're Teacher to me, Teacher.」
？？？
「Fufu, he calls you "Teacher"?」
Azuma
「No, that's just something he's decided to call me...」
all
There's a woman next to Azuma-san smiling happily.
She's wearing a suit, and she's breathtakingly pretty.
No way... Is this person Azuma-san's...
％Ｂ
「Teacher... Is she your mistress?」
I ask in a low voice, just to make sure.
Azuma
「Wha... Are you stupid or something!?」
％Ｂ
「I mean, because, I thought you were married, so...?」
Azuma
「A normal person would ask if she's my wife!」
％Ｂ
「B-But she's so pretty, so I just thought...」
Azuma
「Hoh, so what are you saying, then? You wanna say my wife has to be ugly or something?」

％Ｂ
「Oh no, I don't know what your wife looks like, so I can't really say anything about that...」
？？？
「Fufu, what a funny boy.」
Azuma
「Honestly... She's a member of Shionagi's municipal legislative assembly.」
％Ｂ
「...Huh?」
all
？？？
「Pleased to meet you. I'm Arita, from the municipal legislative assembly. Here's my business card.」

I accept her business card and look at it. It indeed says she's a member of Shionagi's municipal legislative assembly.

Female Assembly Member
「I was interested in your project after I heard about it from Azuma-kun. He told me that there were some students trying to make an aquarium from scratch.」

％Ｂ
「Y-Yes... Oh, if that's the case, then you should talk to...! Um, could I have you wait a moment?」

％Ｂ
「Senpai! Please come here!」
I call Misa-senpai over.
Misa
「Yes, what is it?」
％Ｂ
「This is Arita-san, from the municipal legislative assembly.」
Misa
「She's from the legislative assembly...?」
％Ｂ
「She apparently came here to see this after hearing about our project.」

Misa
「I see, I see I see...」
Female Assembly Member
「I had heard the daughter of Marinpia's director was involved. I've met him several times, and...」

Misa
「I wish to reopen Marinpia one day!」

all
She approaches Arita-san and bows her head.
Misa
「There are dreams in aquariums! They can make people happy, and can create smiles!」

Misa
「Marinpia Shionagi was my parents' dream. They fervently wished for many people to understand the wonder of Shionagi's sea.」


Misa
「And that... is now also my wish.」
Misa
「I think it would be nice to communicate how wonderful the ocean is at least a little, until the day I can reopen the aquarium here in this city.」


I'm a little surprised at her.
I didn't think she'd suddenly say something so straightforward.
all
Female Assembly Member
「Fufu, you're a very assertive and confident person.」
Arita-san smiles at her.
Female Assembly Member
「I like people who talk about their ideals like that.」
Azuma
「That's because that's exactly what you're like.」
Female Assembly Member
「Which means we're both the same kind of person.」
all
Female Assembly Member
「I feel guilty for what we did to your parents.」
Female Assembly Member
「Marinpia Shionagi's closure after all of the work that went into starting it was clearly due to the city's ineptitude.」
Female Assembly Member
「It may have been a loss-making operation, but it was a waste for it to close. I wanted dearly for it to continue operation, from the perspective of educational aid, its contributions to culture, and my own personal opinion.」


Female Assembly Member
「There are many other assembly members who think the same way.」
Misa
「Is... that so?」
Female Assembly Member
「But... pragmatically speaking, it would be difficult to reopen an institution that already closed down once.」


％Ｂ
「I... thought that might be the case.」
Female Assembly Member
「But... you know, this city is moved by the feelings of the people who live in it.」

Female Assembly Member
「What's important is what the residents want. If you all held this wish to reopen Marinpia in your hearts as you did all this work... Then that might happen one day.」


Misa
「Oh...!」
％Ｂ
「Senpai...!」
Female Assembly Member
「It might not be possible now, but I'm sure your dream can come true one day.」

Female Assembly Member
「Looking at the results of your hard work, there's more than enough here for the assembly to possibly consider allowing it to reopen. That's why I want you to keep pursuing your dream, without losing faith.」

Female Assembly Member
「If you two could create such a wonderful aquarium, and such an elaborate model... You can do it, right?」

Misa
「Yes!」
％Ｂ
「Of course!」
all
Azuma
「...That model only exists because of my elaborate blueprint, just so you know.」
Female Assembly Member
「What's that? Making excuses, are we? Are you sore that someone this young's perfectly recreated your architectural design?」


Azuma
「I'm not making excuses! And we don't know if it's perfect yet!」

％Ｂ
「But you complimented me on it the other day...」
Female Assembly Member
「He's always been this way. You don't need to pay him any mind.」
％Ｂ
「Uh huh...」
all
I smile sympathetically, and whisper to Misa-senpai.
％Ｂ
「I'm glad we believed.」
Misa
「Yes... I'm glad... I'm so glad...」
She smiles brightly, tears of joy shining in her eyes.

The Tanabata Festival eventually ends. An after-festival karaoke event begins.

Shuuichi
「All right everyone! Did you all have fun at the Tanabata Festival today!?」
Audience
「Yeaaaahh!」
Shuuichi
「How about we have even more fun with this karaoke festival!?」
Audience
「Yeaaahh!」
％Ｂ
「...Aren't after-festival events usually folk dances?」
Misa
「...This is also my first time participating, so I hadn't thought it would be a karaoke festival...」

％Ｂ
「Man, I thought I was going to dance with you too...」
Misa
「Hehe... I wanted to dance with you too. Like this...」

％Ｂ
「Oh, shall we dance, then?」
Misa
「Oh, yes! Ahahahahahaha!」
％Ｂ
「Hahahahaha!」
I take her by the hand and we spin round and round.
She smiles brightly as her long hair flows behind her.
％Ｂ
「Today was a huge success!」
Misa
「I'm so happy all of those guests came!」
％Ｂ
「The fish were great of course, and people liked Ousaka's constellations too!」
Misa
「And everyone loved the Marinpia model too!」
％Ｂ
「Yes, well... Teacher pointed out a lot of faults, though.」
Misa
「Ufufu, I'm sure he was just being hard on you because he cares!」
％Ｂ
「Well, I'll keep doing my best.」
Misa
「Ufufu... Hahh... But the Tanabata Festival is over now, isn't it?」

％Ｂ
「We still have the city's Tanabata Festival the day after tomorrow.」
Misa
「We do, but... my Tanabata Festival ends today. My final Tanabata Festival here at Shionagi First Academy...」

％Ｂ
「Oh...」
Right...
She's going to graduate this year.
This is the first, and last school Tanabata Festival I'll get to enjoy together with Misa-senpai...

Misa
「So the city's festival is like a bonus for me. Or perhaps something more like a reward. A reward for working hard until today.」


％Ｂ
「A reward? You're right, it might be.」
％Ｂ
「I'll escort you through the festival that day, then.」
Misa
「Oh my, you will!?」
％Ｂ
「Though I don't really know much... but I'll do some research.」

Misa
「I'm so happy! It sounds like it will be a wonderful day.」
Misa
「There's a certain food I love to eat at festival stalls. We must go.」

％Ｂ
「Is it taiyaki?」
Misa
「Wha... How did you know!?」
％Ｂ
「How could I not?」
Though it was a toss-up between that and takoyaki.
Misa
「That fish shape is adorable! I love them!」

％Ｂ
「Then I'll feed you lots of them at the festival.」
Misa
「I'm looking forward to it. Ufufu.」
％Ｂ
「Then... shall we go home today, to rest? I'm sure you're tired, and your parents will be worried if you come home late.」

Misa
「Oh... U-Umm... Well...」
Misa
「I have told my parents... that I will be late, because I will be celebrating.」

Misa
「I just don't want... today to end.」
％Ｂ
「...Yes. I feel the same way.」
I want to spend more time with Misa-senpai.
It's a wish from my heart.
％Ｂ
「Um, Senpai. It's nice how lively it is here and all...」
％Ｂ
「But would you like to relax and celebrate Tanabata... together?」
Misa
「Y-Yes... I think that sounds very wonderful.」
Misa
「I would also... like for us to be alone together.」
She smiles bashfully. My heart rate spikes upward.
