It's been a few days since I started working as a legitimate employee at the Azuma Architectural Firm.
These past few days have really shown me how much work it is to be a working adult.
Azuma
「How's the account statement I asked you to do yesterday going?」
％Ｂ
「Y-Yes! I'm finishing it up right now... I'll have it for you right away!」

Azuma
「I'll check over the structure diagram with that, so have that out for me. The data's in the server. You know how to get it?」

％Ｂ
「Y-Yes, I do! The data from yesterday, right...!?」
Azuma
「We're meeting with a client at 1 p.m. Make the necessary number of copies of the documents in time. Make sure you do it early enough for me to be able to check them over too.」


all
I may be an architect in terms of job title, but I've only just started as a fully fledged employee, so my role is mostly to do grunt work and provide support.

I never have any free time no matter how hard I work.
Every day's filled with copying blueprints, adjusting meeting schedules, and organizing various types of documents.

I came here lots of times for my internship, so I had thought I more or less understood how to work here.\n\r

But it's even harsher to actually work here than I had imagined.
Azuma
「And let's see... we've got a meeting for our next project in the evening. Have the documents for that ready too.」

％Ｂ
「Y-Yes...! Let's see, the next project...!」
My desk is covered in a mess of various documents.
It's obvious at a glance that it isn't organized at all.

Azuma
「I thought I told you to always keep your desk organized. You better never make a mistake along the lines of mixing up paperwork between projects.」


％Ｂ
「I-I understand! I'll find the time to organize it...!」
It's hard to find time to do anything at all.
I'm so caught up with work and learning to do things that I barely have time to breathe.

Azuma
「Trustworthiness is everything. You can be the best architect there is, but there's no point if no one trusts you. You should always keep in mind that you could lose all clients for the rest of your career over a single, small mistake.」


all
％Ｂ
「Y-Yes...! Oh, I found them! These are the documents for our next project, right!?」

I've finally excavated the documents I was looking for from the mountain of paper.
I need to get these organized and ready before the meeting, since I hadn't started on them yet.

Azuma
「You need to manage your time better. You understand how to do the work to some extent, but you don't know how to manage your time. Start by learning that.」


％Ｂ
「Y-Yes...」
all
The harshness of being a working adult and the responsibility I should have toward my work.
I'm having each of those tenets thoroughly beaten into me.
Mr. Azuma's strict.
He never lets even the smallest mistake escape his notice, and he always investigates the root cause behind it.
And he never allows me to make the same mistake twice.
Firm Staff A
「You look like you're having a hard time. Don't worry, you just have to get used to it.」
％Ｂ
「Haha... I'll do my best.」
There's nothing for me to do right now but do the work I've been given.\n \n\r
If I stumble this early on... then becoming independent in the future would be nothing more than a dream within a dream for me.

％Ｂ
「I'm hooome...」
After I finish my tasks during the workday, there's after-hours studying and training, and shadowing of senior staff members.

I'm usually home past 10 p.m., completely exhausted.
Touko
「Welcome home, great job today. You're home really late today.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, there's always so much to learn every day... It's a lot of work, but I need to do my best.」

Touko pauses her studying to welcome me home.
I look at the clock. It's past 11 p.m.
I'm home especially late today.
Touko
「Not enough energy for your welcome-home kiss?」
％Ｂ
「...That's different. If anything, that's what gives me energy.」
Touko
「Ahaha, I see. Mm... chu.」
I'm really grateful to have Touko.
Seeing her always greet me with a warm smile when I get home is nothing short of the greatest comfort I could ever ask for.

Touko
「You'll eat dinner, right? Or do you wanna take a bath first?」
％Ｂ
「Uhh... I think I'll take a bath first. And then I'll eat and go to sleep after that. I have to get up early again tomorrow.」

Touko
「Okaaay. Mmm... Don't you think you'll get fat if you sleep right after you eat...?」

％Ｂ
「Don't worry. I use more energy than I take in at work.」
I don't really even have enough time to eat a satisfying lunch.
My inefficiency's contributing, but there's still just a ton of work for me to do.

Touko
「I'll get the bath and dinner ready, then. You can get changed and take a breather.」

all
Touko's been handling everything around the house ever since I started working.
She's been doing all of the housework without a single complaint, even though she's busy with her own studying.

％Ｂ
「...Man, I owe her everything.」
Everything's different from when we were students.
The amount of time I have to do things and my responsibilities have changed dramatically.
I wonder what would've happened to me if I didn't have Touko.
I imagine it... and I'm seeing myself in tatters.
Touko
「The bath'll be ready in about fifteen minutes. I'm warming the food back up right now, so let's eat together when you're done with your bath, okay?」

％Ｂ
「Huh? You haven't eaten dinner yet either?」
Touko
「Mhm, I thought we could eat together. It wouldn't be fair for me to eat by myself when you're out working hard, right?」




％Ｂ
「...Thanks.」
I'm grateful from the bottom of my heart.
I can feel both my gratitude and my love for Touko grow larger and deeper.

Touko
「Ahaha, it isn't a big deal at all. We're living together, so we need to support each other.」

％Ｂ
「But it's just been you supporting me this whole time... I can't do anything for you...」

Touko
「That's not true. You're letting me take the exam for the qualification, and you feel bad that I'm doing all the housework, right? Just those feelings are enough.」


This is a different emotion from the love that we've had for each other since we were students.
The way we both try to be considerate of each other... has clearly changed.
We each want to support the other because they're important.
And because we're each important to the other, we want to do everything we can.
It's not just us "liking" each other. It's about thinking about someone as precious, from the bottom of our hearts.
This must be real, genuine "love." I can feel my heart filling up at the thought.
％Ｂ
「...You know... I'm blessed to have you with me, Touko.」
Touko
「Wh-What? Why did you say that so suddenly...? Ahaha, that's embarrassing.」

％Ｂ
「I realized after I started working just how much I rely on you, and just how much you're supporting me. I was just thinking... that I can only do my best because I have you.」


Touko
「...I'm the same way. I can do my best because you're doing your best
, Ryousuke

. I think... I'm blessed that you support me lots too.」





％Ｂ
「...I see. I guess we're the same, then.」
I hug her gently.
Putting your feelings into words is so important.
I already knew that... but I always realize it again when we take the time to tell each other how we feel like this.

Touko's smell puts my heart at ease.
It's like being in warm sunlight. Sweet, and just a little burnt-smelling... Wait, burnt-smelling?

％Ｂ
「...You smell something weird? Like something's burning a bit...?」

Touko
「Ahhh! I left the pot on the stove!」
all
And so the sweet mood completely disappears.
Touko throws my arms off of her and runs into the kitchen.

％Ｂ
「Everything okaaay?」
Touko
「Mhm, I think I just barely made it in time. Thank god... Geez, it's all because you suddenly said something weird

, Ryousuke

!」
...So I'm the bad guy, huh?
