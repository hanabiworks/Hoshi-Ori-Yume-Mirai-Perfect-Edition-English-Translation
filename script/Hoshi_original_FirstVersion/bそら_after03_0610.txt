Everything progressed smoothly after I asked Sora to marry me.
We met with each other's parents, and though there was a bit of, "It's about time," involved, everyone was happy for us.

Work's going steadily as well. I'm getting lots of different commissions at my firm.\n \n\r
Sora's been confirmed as being in charge of the planetarium once it reopens, thanks to the success of the final show that she wrote.

And I'm heading to a certain place to take care of something that needs doing for the science museum's reopening.

─Shionagi's Hokuou University.
The science museum that I designed has a marine science facility inspired by Marinpia Shionagi, the aquarium that once stood in Shionagi.


In simple terms, it's like a small aquarium.
The image I had in mind was of an aquarium that would soothe all who came to see it.

But the problem is, I don't have any knowledge relevant to building something as niche as an aquarium.
And so I've come here to Hokuou University to seek a specialist's knowledge.

This university has a department of marine sciences and agriculture.
The plan is to meet with a senior research fellow from the department to discuss things.

After a little while of waiting in the reception area, the person I'm supposed to be meeting with walks in wearing a lab coat.

？？？
「I sincerely apologize for the wait.」
％Ｂ
「Oh no, thank you very much for taking the time out of your busy schedule to meet with me today.」

I bow my head low before even looking at her face.
Misa
「Pleased to meet you. I am Okihara Misa, a senior research fellow here at Hokuou University's department of marine sciences and agriculture.」


％Ｂ
「...」
...What did she say just now?
I slowly look up...
％Ｂ
「...Okihara...senpai?」
To see none other than Okihara-senpai.

Misa
「Oh dear, oh my... If it isn't Ryousuke-san...! What a coincidence!」

Misa
「Oh dear, oh my... Of all the things to happen...! What a coincidence!」

％Ｂ
「...I had no idea you were the one I was supposed to be meeting with...」
This pretty much goes beyond coincidence.
What a small world.
Misa
「I was told that I was to be meeting with the designer of the science museum that is to be reopened, so would that be...?」


％Ｂ
「Oh, yes. I will be in charge of the design.」
Misa
「I see. I see, I see...」
She looks surprised, and then smiles brightly at me.
Misa
「Thank you very much.」
％Ｂ
「Wha... Why are you thanking me...?」
Misa
「I have heard that this new science museum will have an aquarium.」
％Ｂ
「Oh... Y-Yes, well... It will be small, but I wanted to create an aquarium like Marinpia.」

Misa
「Reopening Marinpia was my dream. That dream still has not come true... but I am genuinely overjoyed that you have made it come true in my stead, Ryousuke-san.」


Misa
「Reopening Marinpia was my dream. That dream still has not come true... but I am genuinely overjoyed that you have made it come true in my stead.」


％Ｂ
「Oh no, Marinpia Shionagi was a place I valued very much in my memories as well.」

Misa
「Now then, what shall we begin our discussion with? Please, ask me anything. I will do everything I can to help you.」


all
％Ｂ
「─So yeah, I ended up meeting Okihara-senpai like that.」
I'm talking to Sora about what happened today after she came to the office with burgers later that night.

Sora
「...Was Misa doing well?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, she was just full of energy. It was impossible to stop her once we started talking about aquariums.」

％Ｂ
「Her eyes were shining like a kid's while she was going on and on about the value of jellyfish tanks.」

Sora
「...Misa's always Misa.」
％Ｂ
「You seem kinda happy.」
Sora
「...I am. Everyone's coming back with you at the center.」
Sora
「...I am. Everyone's coming back with you at the center.」
％Ｂ
「You think so?」
Sora
「It reminds me of the Tanabata Festival.」
Sora considers that summer one where she met the people who changed her life.
If I could recreate that time for her...
Yeah. She'd definitely be really happy.
all
There's no end to the dreams I want to have come true.
But first─let's start with just one.
One old promise.
We'll go to that place where we said we would go someday, together.
