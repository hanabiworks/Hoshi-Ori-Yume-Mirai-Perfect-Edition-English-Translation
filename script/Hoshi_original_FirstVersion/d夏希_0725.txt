「Thank you very much!」
Natsuki
「Hmhmhmmh～ I wonder how they came out～」
We got the photos we took last night developed.
The freshly developed photos are inside the envelope in Natsuki's hand.
％Ｂ
「I didn't know developing film was so quick.」
Natsuki
「Yeah, I heard it used to take a whole day and stuff before. I'm glad the world's become more convenient now.」

％Ｂ
「You aren't looking yet?」
Natsuki
「It'll be something to look forward to at school.」
She smiles happily.

Misa
「These are the photos you took?」
％Ｂ
「...Yes.」
We ran into Okihara-senpai, who was at school to take care of the jellyfish, on our way up to the rooftop.

We decided to show her the photos before we showed them to Ousaka, to get an idea of how someone who wasn't too well versed in stars would view them.

Misa
「This one is blurred, and it is quite difficult to identify what is pictured.」

Misa
「This one... is pitch black. There doesn't appear to be anything in this picture.」
Misa
「This picture is very pretty... but what are all of these lines of light?」

％Ｂ
「Those are the stars. It looks like the stars moved and left trails of light because the exposure time was too long.」


Misa
「I see, I see. Um... And so which of these photos is of a constellation?」

Natsuki
「Hgh...」
Natsuki twitches in response to Okihara-senpai's comments as she lies face down on a desk.

Natsuki
「...I wanna die...」
Misa
「Is something the matter, Natsuki-san?」
％Ｂ
「Ah... She's currently in the middle of being incredibly depressed because the photos she took were even worse than she expected.」

Misa
「...Yes, these photos are indeed unlike you, Natsuki-san. You took such wonderful photos for my own request.」


％Ｂ
「It seems like this was her first time taking pictures of stars. That's why I've told her it isn't strange to have messed up, but...」

Seems taking pictures of stars is harder than we thought.
Misa
「Perhaps you would like to show these to Sora-san for now?」
Natsuki
「I couldn't show her these... If I showed Sora photos like these... she'd just laugh at me.」

Misa
「I do not believe Sora-san would laugh...」
Natsuki
「And more importantly, I don't want to show others photos like these... I can't believe they came out looking like that, after all I said...」


％Ｂ
「Oh yeah, you did say they should leave everything to you and stuff...」
Natsuki
「And I ended up with those photos... Fufu... It's hilarious. Hilarious, isn't it...? You can laugh too

, Ryousuke

. Just call me an out-of-focus little dummy...」

％Ｂ
「Man, you've got a really bad way of getting depressed...」
％Ｂ
「...Anyway, we're gonna go again tonight, right?」
Natsuki
「Well... Yeah.」
％Ｂ
「If what you did yesterday didn't work, then that means you just need to try other methods, right? Think of it as taking a step closer toward success.」


Natsuki
「
Ryousuke
Yeah
...」
％Ｂ
「Ousaka asked you to take the photos 'cause she believed you'd definitely get good ones, right?」

％Ｂ
「And I know you'll get amazing photos too, Natsuki.」

Misa
「You will be fine, Natsuki-san. You fulfilled my own expectations very well. I am sure you will be able to take the photos Sora-san wishes to have.」


Natsuki
「Yeah, that's true... There aren't any photos I can't take, right.」
Natsuki
「It's like you said
, Ryousuke

. My screwups from yesterday took me one step closer toward success.」

all
Natsuki
「All right! Let's do this! I'll get them tonight for sure! I'll show you, Big Dipper!」

I don't really understand what she's saying, but she's back up on her feet now.
She's back to her earnest single-mindedness that keeps her only looking at the now.
This is how Segawa Natsuki should be.
all
And later that night─
Natsuki
「I'll just have to keep up the trial-and-error method for the exposure time.」

％Ｂ
「If it's too long, the stars'll move, and if it's too short, they won't show up on film... Right?」

Natsuki
「That's right. I also need countermeasures against camera shake. This area's nice for star photography because there aren't many buildings around, but that means there's not much to block the wind either.」


Natsuki
「I'll shorten the tripod to lower its center of gravity... There we go.」
％Ｂ
「How about we try securing the legs of the tripod with rocks?」
Natsuki
「That's a good idea. Let's go find some rocks later.」
％Ｂ
「And it'd be nice if we could surround the camera with cardboard or something to block the wind directly.」

Natsuki
「Tadaaa♪ I'm one step ahead of you for that!」
％Ｂ
「Pretty good.」
Natsuki
「What can I say? So I'll put this around the camera... There. I think that's good. Now all that's left is the actual photography!」

％Ｂ
「Hope it goes well.」
Natsuki
「Don't worry. I won't make the same mistakes as yesterday.」
I really do want it to go well.
For Ousaka's sake.
And... for Natsuki's sake too...
