Natsuki
「Oh, looks like the laundry's done. I'll go get it.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, thanks. I'll clean up over here.」
all
We always do housework together in the mornings on our days off.
We do the laundry that's piled up since last time and vacuum the house.
It's a bit inconvenient that doing it together means we can only do this housework on our days off.

Natsuki
「Here we go. Phew, this is heavy.」
Natsuki comes back with a basket filled with laundry.
We have a lot of clothes, so it's a lot of work hanging them up to dry.
Natsuki
「Hey, so we can just do laundry all at once like this for now, but are we gonna have to do it every day if we have a kid?」

％Ｂ
「Probably. If we had a kid, they'd probably come back covered in mud every day.」

Natsuki
「What? Really?」
％Ｂ
「That's how it goes, right? Or not?」
Natsuki
「That's just for boys, isn't it? I don't think I ever... Wait, no, I might've been the same way...」


％Ｂ
「I only ever remember my mom yelling at me 'cause I always came home with dirty clothes.」

Natsuki
「I think I remember folding laundry lots with my mom.」
Natsuki
「I always liked talking about random stuff with her while we folded nice, dry clothes that smelled like the sun together.」


％Ｂ
「That's a real girly memory.」
Natsuki
「I am a girl, you know.」
all
She starts hanging up the laundry.
Natsuki
「Hey. If we have a kid, do you want a boy or a girl?」

％Ｂ
「Well let's see... I think I'd want a boy. I'd wanna play soccer with him and stuff. What about you?」


Natsuki
「I think I want a girl. I wanna dress her up in cute clothes and take lots of photos of her.」

％Ｂ
「You'd probably be one heck of a doting parent. I could see you going from outfit to outfit like she was a dress-up doll and taking photos while calling her cute every time.」


Natsuki
「Same for you. I could see you going, "You'll represent Japan at the World Cup when you're older!" just 'cause her kicked the ball a little well.」

％Ｂ
「Hahaha, yeah, right. I wouldn't get that bad.」
...Probably.
Natsuki
「...Did you know? You can apparently choose whether or not you give birth to a boy or a girl.」

％Ｂ
「Oh yeah, I've heard something like that before.」
Natsuki
「It's not 100 percent, but I've heard you can up your chances of one or the other a bit.」

％Ｂ
「I think it's something like it's easier for a boy to be born if the woman comes during sex.」

Natsuki
「Wha... Really!?」
％Ｂ
「I mean, I don't know if it's true or not. But I feel like there's scientific support or something...」

all
I pull out my phone and open a search engine.
Let's see, selecting sex of child... orgasm... boy...
％Ｂ
「...When a woman orgasms, her vagina becomes more alkaline, something about how that makes Y sperm, which is what makes boys...? That makes it easier for those sperm to contact the egg... apparently.」


％Ｂ
「It looks like there's support from medical sciences.」
Natsuki
「...」
Natsuki stops hanging up clothes and lapses into thought.
％Ｂ
「Natsuki? What's wrong?」
Natsuki
「Oh no... I might not be able to give birth to anything but boys...」
％Ｂ
「...O-Oh, right.」
I guess I should lay off on trying to get Natsuki to come if we want a girl...

all
We finish up the housework, eat lunch, and then go out for a walk to the seaside park.\n\r

Natsuki's got her camera with her, of course.
The park's filled with people because it's the weekend.
I see lots of families and couples.
％Ｂ
「Maybe I'll save up and buy a used car once my pay goes up a little more.」
Natsuki
「Huh?」
％Ｂ
「And then we can go out somewhere far to take photos.」
Natsuki
「What are you talking about? We don't have that kind of money. There's gas, taxes, inspections. There's a lot of maintenance and stuff, you know.」

％Ｂ
「Gh...」
She's a lot more pragmatic when it comes to stuff like this.
Or maybe I'm just too idealistic...?
Natsuki
「But thanks.」
Natsuki
「It makes me happy to hear you say something like that. But here's good enough for me. I can always take photos even without going somewhere far away.」


％Ｂ
「Well... Yeah, but...」
Natsuki
「And it's fun just taking our time on walks together right now. We'll get a car once we really need it.」


％Ｂ
「Got it. Let's do that, then.」
Natsuki
「Mhm. Okay then, let's really start taking pictures!」

She brings her camera back up to her face and presses the shutter button.
all
A seagull in flight.
A dog on its leash during a walk with its owner.
A cat basking in the sun.
A boat, far away at sea.
She cuts out the "now" of everything that catches her eye and preserves it.
I like just watching her go about it from a few steps back.

It's always been this way.
And I'm sure it won't ever change...
Natsuki
「Oh, hey, don't you think that family with kids looks pretty good?」
all
％Ｂ
「Hm?」
There's a young couple with a small child a little ways away from us.
The couple must be around the same age as us.
Their child's still a toddler, and he's stumbling around. He looks like he might fall over any moment.

Natsuki
「It's kinda nerve-racking just watching.」
％Ｂ
「He's fine. See how the mom's in front of him and the dad's behind? They're ready for him to fall at any time.」


Natsuki
「Oh, I get it.」
The mother's stooped over in front of her child, clapping her hands while moving bit by bit to guide him.

The toddler walks toward his mother, pulled along by the clapping, and his father's following closely behind him, ready to lend a hand at any moment.


Natsuki
「You know... That's kinda nice.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah... It is.」
Natsuki
「I know we talked about it this morning already... but I'd be fine with a boy or a girl. Either way, I'd be happy.」


％Ｂ
「Same.」
I don't care if they're a boy or a girl, as long as they're born into this world for us.\n\r

That's how I feel watching that family.
Natsuki
「I'm gonna go ask if I can take photos of them!」
％Ｂ
「Huh? A-All right...」
all
Natsuki's already running toward them by the time I reply.
％Ｂ
「Man... Same as ever, huh.」
I walk to catch up with her.
Natsuki
「Excuse me, could I speak with you for a moment? Here's my business card.」

She holds it out to the father.
Natsuki always puts on a bright smile when she does this, to convince people she isn't anyone to be suspicious of.

Father
「...You're a cameraman?」
Natsuki
「Yes, I work at a studio in the marketplace. Though I'm still just an assistant, to be precise.」

Natsuki
「You, your wife, and your child have a very nice atmosphere about you. I was wondering if it would be okay for me to take a photo of your family.」


Father
「Hey, she says she wants to take a photo of us.」
Mother
「Why not? Let's have her take one.」

Natsuki
「Thank you very much! Then please, just keep going about your business. I'll be taking the photos on my own over here.」


She brings her camera up to her face and starts taking pictures.
She does it from a little further way, trying to make her presence as easy to ignore for them as possible.

But, the couple aside, their child's really interested in Natsuki's camera.
He veers toward Natsuki and her camera of his own accord.
Natsuki happily accepts the development and clicks the shutter over and over.

all
Natsuki
「Thank you very much!」
Natsuki bows her head low after getting one last photo of the couple with their child in their arms.

Natsuki
「Um, I'd like to send you the photos I took, if you'd like, so may I get your address?」

Mother
「You're even going to send them to us? I'm looking forward to it!\nWe're getting pictures of yooou! Isn't that gweeat～」


The mother smiles and kisses her child on the cheek.
Natsuki
「And also, this would also be only if you permit it, but may we put up the photos we took today on our studio's show window?」


Father
「Agh, that'd be embarrassing.」
Mother
「I think it's fine. It'd be a once-in-a-lifetime way of remembering today.」

Natsuki
「It's just, I'm still inexperienced, so that would only be if the head cameraman approves...」

Father
「What do you think?」
Mother
「Of course it's okay. If you do put them up, then we'll definitely go see.」

Natsuki
「Thank you very much! The studio's address is on my business card from earlier, so please come!」


all
Natsuki finally walks over to the bench I'm sitting on after thanking the family over and over.

％Ｂ
「Nice work.」
Natsuki
「Thanks for waiting! Sorry for leaving you on your own like that.」

％Ｂ
「Nah, it's fine. More importantly, did you get some good shots?」
Natsuki
「Mhm, great ones! I'm glad they were a really nice couple. And their kid was super cute too.」

Natsuki
「Scenery and animals are nice, but taking photos of people's smiles is always the most fun. I get happy just doing the photography.」


％Ｂ
「And it looks like that couple was happy about it too.」
Natsuki
「Right! That's right! They said they'd come see the photos if I can get them displayed at our studio! I hope they get approved.」


％Ｂ
「I'm sure it'll be fine with your photos.」
Natsuki
「No, there's a world of difference between my photos and Sensei's. Her photos get you emotional just from a glance. I'm still nowhere near as good as she is.」


％Ｂ
「She's that good?」
Natsuki
「People might go, "You're good at photography," when they see my photos. But when people see her photos, they just go silent. Do you know why?」


％Ｂ
「...'Cause they get that emotional?」
Natsuki
「Right! That's exactly right! They get so emotional they're lost for words! I was the same way. The moment I saw her photos, my breath caught, and I couldn't say anything.」


％Ｂ
「I think your photos are worth getting emotional over too, though. You did manage to win the judges' special award at the Tanabata Festival, after all.」

Natsuki
「But do you remember the one that won the grand prize back then? That was her photo.」

％Ｂ
「...Right...」
We had already met Natsuki's teacher back when we were in high school.
She was working at the photography store that developed the constellation photos we took for the Tanabata Festival. 
％Ｂ
「Well, either way. I hope they get put up.」
Natsuki
「Mhm! Oh, can I keep going a little more?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, of course. Take as many pictures as you want.」
Natsuki
「Thanks! I'll be off for a bit, then!」
all
I vaguely watch her from the bench as she runs off again, camera in hand.
