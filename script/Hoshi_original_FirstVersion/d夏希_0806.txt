Natsuki's taking photos of the people who've come to visit the school's Tanabata Festival.

Natsuki
「I like it! Everyone's smiling!」
She's right. Everyone's got a smile on their face as they walk through the gates.
Some of the adults wave toward Natsuki's camera.
Some of the kids do peace signs.
Natsuki
「It kinda makes me happy just taking pictures of them.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, I can see why. Anyhow, what's the plan for today?」
Natsuki
「Let's start by going to Misa-san's. How about we just walk around to the other displays from there?」

％Ｂ
「Sure thing.」
Natsuki
「...Sorry about this. You sure you weren't just hoping to enjoy the festival normally?」

％Ｂ
「I'm in the event committee. I'm supposed to get people to enjoy the festival instead of enjoying it myself, right?」

％Ｂ
「And besides, I still get to walk around the festival as your assistant. It's way better than just being on standby in one spot. What I'm trying to say is... anywhere's fun if it's with you.」


Natsuki
「Mhm, I'm glad I get to go around taking grad-alb photos with you too
, Ryousuke

.」

％Ｂ
「Natsuki...」
Natsuki
「
Ryousuke
Ehehe
...」
all
Boy
「Mom, what are those people doing?」
Mother
「That's what they call an idiot couple. Be understanding, and don't stare.」
Boy
「Okaaay.」
Natsuki
「...」
％Ｂ
「...」
Natsuki
「A-Anyway, let's go to Misa-san's display.」
％Ｂ
「R-Right!」
Natsuki
「Wow... What the heck... There's so many people...!」
％Ｂ
「You're kidding me... It's so crowded...!」
The naturalist club's mini marine zoo, "Sea of Shionagi," is even more of a success than we expected.

Marika
「Yeees, welcome! Please take your time and look through the tanks. Enjoy!」

Shinozaki's in charge of reception.
％Ｂ
「H-Hey, Shinozaki...」
all
Marika
「Oh, you came!」
％Ｂ
「Things are pretty crazy here.」
Marika
「We've had lots of kids come ever since the festival started. I'm so surprised.」

It's like Shinozaki says. Most of the guests are either families or groups of kids.

％Ｂ
「I guess it's popular with the kids 'cause it's an aquarium...」
Natsuki
「Where's Misa-san?」
Marika
「Okihara-san's talking to the kids inside.」
all
I look inside. Senpai's set up an impromptu seminar for the kids.

Girl A
「What's this fish called?」
Misa
「This is a fish in the order Scorpaeniformes, family Agonidae, known as a saburou.」

Girl A
「She said it's called a saburou. What a weird naaame.」
Misa
「This fish lives in the seas near where all of you live, here in Shionagi.」

Boy B
「You're lyiiing. I've never seen a fish like this!」
Misa
「Usually, it lives at the bottom of the sea. It has come all the way here today to say hello to all of you.」


Misa
「"Hello there. I am Saburou!"」
Misa
「See?」
The kids all laugh happily at Senpai's ventriloquism (?).
Natsuki
「Misa-san's a lot more interesting than you'd expect...」
％Ｂ
「I was thinking the same thing.」
Girl A
「Bye-bye, Onee-chan!」
Misa
「Yes, please come play here once more.」
％Ｂ
「Great work, Senpai.」
Misa
「Oh my. Welcome.」
Natsuki
「Things are really crazy in here, aren't they?」
Misa
「Yes, things have turned out this way all thanks to you. I am very surprised myself.」

％Ｂ
「It was definitely a good idea to do the marine zoo. Lots of children came to see real sea creatures.」


Misa
「But the zoo is not the only thing the children like. Please, have a look over there.」

all
She points at the panels of the photos Natsuki took.\n \n\r

There's a little ring of children around them.
Misa
「Do you see how excited the children are? They are all engrossed in your photos, Natsuki-san.」

Natsuki
「Wha... With my photos?」
all
Girl B
「Mom, look, this photo's amazing! The little fishies' faces are so big!」

Girl B's Mom
「Wow, you're right! I wonder how they took these photos?」
Boy C
「This crab's super awesome! It's sooo cool!」
Misa
「And it is not just the children either. The adults also seem to be very interested in these photos, since they are so different from what one would find in a reference book or field guide.」

Misa
「Look at them smile. They seem like they are having so much fun, don't they?」
Natsuki
「Because of my photos...」
％Ｂ
「That's great, Natsuki.」
Natsuki
「Huh? ...Oh, mhm...」
Girl C
「Hey, Onee-chan. What's this floaty thing over here?」
Misa
「Oh, yes. I will be right there. I apologize, but I must go.」

％Ｂ
「Oh, yes, please keep it up! We'll come by to see how things are going again later!」
％Ｂ
「...All right. How about we go to Ousaka's display next?」
Natsuki
「...」
％Ｂ
「Hey... Natsuki? Something up?」
Natsuki
「Wha... No... It's nothing... Okay then, the astronomy club's next!」

％Ｂ
「Oh, man... Here too...」
Natsuki
「It's crazy busy here too...」
Touko
「Hey, you there! It's dangerous, so no running! No need to rush, the stars won't run away!」

％Ｂ
「Yukimura, you're handling the reception?」
Touko
「Hey there, welcome. In for a penny, in for a pound, I guess. Or wait, maybe not? More like I'm in it until the end?」

Natsuki
「There's lots of kids here too.」
Touko
「Yeah, there are. It's actually kinda helpful, in a way.」
％Ｂ
「What do you mean?」
all
Touko
「You know... That thing with the dirty mythology stories from before. Kids don't really care about stuff if it's all just words, right? They get bored halfway through and stuff.」


Touko
「We haven't gotten any complaints from the guests yet, thanks to that.」
％Ｂ
「Is that okay, though? After you went through the trouble of making it and everything.」
Touko
「Yeah, Fluffyhead seems a bit unsatisfied. But people just love your constellation photos in exchange, Camera-chan.」

Natsuki
「Wha... My photos?」
Touko
「Everyone just stops dead when they see them. It doesn't matter if they're a kid or an adult, they'll just stop in front of the photos and stare.」

Touko
「There was this person who came earlier with a big camera slung around their neck. It was kinda funny watching Fluffyhead not really know what to do when they were interrogating her about those photos.」


Touko
「Oh, and tons of people are taking photos of the photo panels with their phones and stuff. They wanna use them as their phone wallpapers because they're so pretty.」

％Ｂ
「Huh, wow! They love your photos! That's great, Natsuki!」

Natsuki
「Oh... M-Mhm...」
％Ｂ
「Let's go check up on Ousaka for a bit too.」
all
Boy A
「Hey, where's the swan in this picture?」
Sora
「...It's not a real swan. You connect the stars to form the shape of a swan.」

Girl A
「Which ones do you connect?」
Sora
「...This is Deneb. From this one to the four stars below it. And this is Albireo, the swan's beak. This is Sadr, and this is Gienah.」


Boy A
「I don't see a swan at aaall.」
Girl A
「I don't see iiit.」
Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「She kinda looks like she's struggling...」
Girl A
「But this photo's really pretty!」
Boy A
「Is this from a book?」
Sora
「...No. It's a photo of the real thing. Taking good photos of stars is a lot of work. You have to be really good at photography to get photos this pretty. The person who took these photos is very, very good at photography.」


Natsuki
「...」
Boy A
「I want this photo!」
Girl A
「Me toooo! Give me it! Give me iiit!」
Sora
「...No. These photos are all mine. I won't back down.」
Boy A
「You're meeean!」
Girl A
「Meeean!」
Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「Pfffh... Ousaka has no idea how to deal with them... Hey, Natsuki, maybe you could try selling those photos or something.」

all
Natsuki
「...」
％Ｂ
「Natsuki? Earth to Natsuki?」
Natsuki
「Oh... Sorry...」
％Ｂ
「You okay? You've been acting a bit weird.」
Natsuki
「No, it's nothing.」
％Ｂ
「...?」
all
Natsuki
「...Everyone looks like they're having a good time...」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. It's a once-in-a-year festival, after all.」
Natsuki
「...All of those kids were smiling at Misa-san's and Sora's displays, weren't they...?」

％Ｂ
「Hm? Yeah, they all looked like they were having fun.」
Natsuki
「I was really happy knowing that the photos I took made someone smile.」

Natsuki
「I thought... It might be wonderful if I could keep on taking photos like that.」

Natsuki
「I never really cared about what photos I took, as long as I was taking photos at all... but it might not be bad to wanna be a cameraman like that either...」

％Ｂ
「A cameraman who takes photos that make people smile... I like it. Sounds just like you.」

Natsuki
「...You think so?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah... I think it sounds way better than calling yourself something like a hyper-multimedia cameraman, at least.」

Natsuki
「Gh... You're making fun of meee...」
％Ｂ
「You're the one who said it. Ahaha! But that's good, don't you think?」

Natsuki
「Huh? Good?」
％Ｂ
「You've found a goal for yourself as a cameraman, right?」
Natsuki
「Yeah!」
all
Lots of smiles were born through Natsuki's photos at this Tanabata Festival. Both Okihara-senpai and Ousaka always went about their club activities alone until now. But now they're connected with so many people.


Everyone's become interested in Shionagi's seas, and in Shionagi's night sky...
And the photos that Natsuki took are what connected all of them.
I think Okihara-senpai and Ousaka gained lots of things from the Tanabata Festival.
But I don't think they compare to what Natsuki's gained.
─She had been taking photos just to take photos up until now...
But now she's finally found a principle to align herself with.
Shuuichi
「All right everyone! We all have fun at the Tanabata Festival today!?」
Audience
「Yeaaaah!」
Shuuichi
「Let's get things even more exciting with some after-festival karaoke!」
Audience
「Yeaaaah!」
Once the Tanabata Festival ends and the guests go home, lots of students gather on the grounds. It's the after-festival.

The main event's apparently a karaoke party for the entire student population, with anyone being allowed to jump in.

％Ｂ
「Aren't you usually supposed to do a bonfire or a folk dance for this kinda stuff?」

Natsuki
「Ohh... It's apparently been a karaoke party at this school for years now, ever since one of the previous student council presidents said people who didn't have a girlfriend had the right to enjoy the after-festival too.」


％Ｂ
「Hmm... Well, fine by me. Karaoke sounds more fun anyway. You gonna sing something?」

Natsuki
「I'm in charge of this, aren't I?」
She looks pointedly at her camera.
I feel dumb for even asking.
all
People walk up on stage as the urge to sing strikes them, with no predetermined order or anything, and sing their hearts out.

There's one guy wailing away passionately on his own, three girls singing into a single microphone, and even a group of ten or so sports club members belting out a song all at once, arms over each other's shoulders.


It doesn't matter if the people up on stage are good at singing or not. And if it's a song people know, then the audience sings along.

Natsuki smiles as she takes photos of the sight.
Natsuki
「This is really nice. I just know everyone'll love seeing this in the grad-album once they're older.」

She's taking photos for the sake of other people's smiles.
The things she's taking photos of as a member of the grad-alb committee haven't changed, but now that her philosophy's changed, I'm sure her photos are all the better for it.

_00cutinBS
Shuuichi
「All right, and I'm singing next! Me, the chair of the event committee! Class 2-D! Nirasawa Shuuichiii!」

Audience
「Yeaaahh!」
％Ｂ
「Huh, so Shuuichi's singing too.」
Natsuki
「He's sure making things fun.」
_00cutinBS
Kaori
「Kyaaaahh! Shuuichiii!」
all
％Ｂ
「Oh, it's Kaori-san...」
Natsuki
「Huh? Who's that?」
％Ｂ
「Shuuichi's girlfriend.」
Natsuki
「Huh... She's really showy-looking, isn't she? Didn't expect that from Nirasawa.」
all
all
Shuuichi
「Kaori... My looove♪ You were so beautiful, reading books♪ You placed a bookmark in my heaaart♪」


Natsuki
「An original song, here... He sure is brave.」
％Ｂ
「Those lyrics are the worst thing ever...」
Natsuki
「Oh, there's the booing.」
％Ｂ
「Coulda seen that coming...」
Shuuichi
「Thank you so much! Thank yooou!」
Natsuki
「Wha, he's done already...!?」
all
％Ｂ
「What the heck did he even get up on stage for...?」
Kaori
「That was soooo cool～ Shuuichiii～!」
And what the heck did she even come here for...?
Now that the after-festival's done, it's time to celebrate a job well done─or so I thought, but that was naive of me.

The clubs with displays in school can do their cleanup tomorrow, but the naturalist and astronomy clubs were in the old school building.

It's normally off limits, so we have to clear out by the end of the day...

％Ｂ
「Phew... We're done moving all of the animals in the tanks.」

Misa
「Thank you very much for your work.」
％Ｂ
「Is there anything still left over there?」

Marika
「I think it's just the photo panels left.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, I'll go grab those, then. Should I just bring them over here?」

Misa
「Well, in fact, those photos were just so wonderful that the photography club has agreed to take good care of them.」

％Ｂ
「Really?」
Misa
「I would like for them to be used in Tanabata Festival displays in the following years as well, if possible.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, really... So that means that the naturalist club's activities are now linked to the next generation of students, doesn't it?」

Misa
「Yes! This is also all thanks to your and Natsuki-san's help.」



％Ｂ
「So then does that mean the astronomy club's photos are going to be kept by the photography club too?」
Marika
「No, Ousaka-san said she'd take the astronomy club's photos home herself. She apparently just wouldn't budge on that.」

％Ｂ
「She could've just made copies.」
Marika
「I'm sure they're meaningful to her as the photos that were actually displayed.」
％Ｂ
「Fair enough.」
They're photos that Ousaka'll associate with good memories, which gives them more value than any new photos would have.

Misa
「And so I would be grateful if you could bring the panels to the photography club.」

％Ｂ
「I understand. I'll go do that, then.」
Marika
「Oh, the event committee's apparently going to celebrate afterward at the family restaurant in front of the station after we're done. Want me to wait for you?」

％Ｂ
「Nah, you can go on without me. I'll head over as soon as I'm done with the panels.」

Marika
「Okay, got it. I'll see you there, then.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. Later.」
％Ｂ
「Panels, panels... Here they are. Hup...!」
Natsuki
「...You're still not done?」
％Ｂ
「Agh!? Y-You scared me out of my skin...! I didn't know you were still here, Natsuki.」

Natsuki
「I wanna say the same to you. I waited forever and ever and you never came out from the school building.」

％Ｂ
「What? You were waiting for me? But you already knew the event committee's meeting up at that family restaurant, right?」

Natsuki
「I knew, but I'm not in the event committee.」
％Ｂ
「But Shuuichi invited you too.」
Natsuki
「He did, but... I don't wanna go by myself, you know?」
％Ｂ
「You sound like a little kid... Shuuichi's there, and so's Shinozaki, so it's fine, right? And it's not like you're a shy person or anything.」


Natsuki
「...Geez, you just don't get iiit.」
She walks over to me.
Natsuki
「Put the panels down.」
％Ｂ
「Wha...?」
Natsuki
「Put the panels down!」
％Ｂ
「...Okay.」
all
I do as she says and place them back on the table.
Natsuki
「Okay, hands up in the air!」
％Ｂ
「...Okay?」
I put my hands up in the air, and she hugs me.
％Ｂ
「...Natsuki?」
Natsuki
「...I stayed behind because I wanted to be alone together with you, obviously.」

She squeezes me tighter.
Natsuki
「We're finally alone... Ehehe.」
The bashful way she said that is just so, so cute...
Natsuki
「Thanks for today...」
％Ｂ
「What about today?」
Natsuki
「For being together with me the whole day, even though it was your first Tanabata Festival at this school.」

％Ｂ
「Oh, you don't need to thank me for that or anything. The end result's that I got to walk around the festival together with you, so it was lots of fun for me.」


Natsuki
「Mhm, it was fun for me too. Thank you.」
％Ｂ
「There's still the city's festival, so let's have fun at that too.」
Natsuki
「Oh... Maybe I shouldn't bring my camera for that one?」
％Ｂ
「Why not? I thought you were gonna take pictures of lots of stuff.」
Natsuki
「Mhm, but I feel like I'll get caught up in my photography again if I do that...」

％Ｂ
「That's fine. I like you, including when you're taking pictures.」

Natsuki
「Wha... Why would you say that all of a sudden...?」
％Ｂ
「No one's around to make fun of us now, right?」
Natsuki
「Uuh... But it's kinda embarrassing when you say it out of nowhere like that.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, now that's some good information. I think I'll tell you stuff like that without any warning from now on, to get you embarrassed.」


Natsuki
「I-I'll do it to you by surprise too if you do that, you know!」

％Ｂ
「I'm not gonna get embarrassed just 'cause it's a surprise.」
Natsuki
「
Ryousuke. 
Hey. 
I love you.」
％Ｂ
「...」
％Ｂ
「Agh... Wait a sec, my face is all hot. I was prepared, but not for "love"... Crap, I'm blushing.」

Natsuki
「Hmhmh! How's that?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, you got me... but your face is red from saying it too.」
Natsuki
「Mhm, I know I'm the one who said it, but I'm still blushing.」
We smile at each other with our faces really close.
And then we kiss as if it were the most natural thing in the world.
Natsuki
「...My heart's beating kinda fast...」
％Ｂ
「'Cause anyone could see us here?」
Natsuki
「I don't need to worry about that. No one's here anymore.」
％Ｂ
「Right, I guess everyone's gone to that family restaurant already.」
Natsuki
「Do you think we need to head there right away?」
Her voice is heated and husky in my ears.
And her arms tighten a little behind my back.
％Ｂ
「I think we can make them wait just a bit.」
I tighten my hold on her too.
Her exhalations smell nice somehow, and they're chipping away at my rationality.

％Ｂ
「Natsuki...」
Natsuki
「Mhm
... Ryousuke

...」
We kiss again.
This time, it's a deep kiss. As if we were savoring how we taste deep inside.
