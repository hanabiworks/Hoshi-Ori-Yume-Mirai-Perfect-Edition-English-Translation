「Please excuse me, then!」
And that makes five.
Let's tell Shinozaki how it went.
【％Ｂ】「I just picked up my #Nfifth one. How are #Nthings on your end?」
【Marika】「I have four. I think #Nit's just the astronomy #Nand naturalist clubs #Nleft?」,0
Hmm. Where should I go?
I could just go to both, since they're not too far from where I am...

【Marika】「Where are you right now?」
【％Ｂ】「Third floor hallway. #NWas going to go to the #Nrooftop.」
【Marika】「Oh, it's fine. I'll #Ncome to where you are, #Nso could you give me #Nyour forms?」
【％Ｂ】「Why?」
【Marika】「I'll go to Ousaka-san #Nand Okihara-san. #NI'll turn the forms in #Ntoo.」
【％Ｂ】「I can't just have you #Ndo everything.」
【Marika】「You're going to go try #Nto recruit Yukimura-#Nsan, aren't you?」
...She knows exactly why I was hurrying.
She's trying to be considerate.
I'll accept her thoughtfulness.
【％Ｂ】「Sorry. Thanks.」
【Marika】_st_0109
％Ｂ
「Sorry I'm... late, uh...」
Touko
「Zzz... Zzz...」
％Ｂ
「...She sure is sleeping soundly.」
I feel like normally the sound of the door opening would wake you up.
Maybe she's just not expecting anyone other than me to show up?
％Ｂ
「...」
This is the second time I'm seeing Yukimura's sleeping face like this.\n \n\r
Maybe it's because my feelings have changed in these past few days, but... there's something different about how her face looks when she's sleeping now.

It's comforting, but also exciting.
I want to try touching her soft-looking cheeks.
Her slightly damp lips seem incredibly alluring to me.
％Ｂ
（It's pretty much become habit for me to come here now...）
Thinking about it, I've been coming to the old school building to see Yukimura after school pretty much every day now.

I've gotten used to the atmosphere here, and I've taken a liking to it.
Touko
「Mmh...nh... Zzz... mnyah... nnhh...」
％Ｂ
「I don't wanna wake her up. Guess I'll just kill time here...」
Touko
「Zzz... Zzz...nh... Ehehe, c'mere, c'mere～」
％Ｂ
「Hgh!? Wh-What...!?」
Touko
「You're... so cuuute～ Good boy～」
I-Is she saying this to me!?
Does... Yukimura think I'm "cute"!?

Touko
「Meow～ ...Mmhehe... Zzz...」
％Ｂ
「...A cat.」
...Figured.
I was an idiot for expecting anything else.
％Ｂ
「Honestly... She's so laid back.」
It's like time passes slowly just by being around her.
I realize there's a smile on my face.
％Ｂ
「I wonder how she'd respond... if I told her I "like" her.」
Touko
「Nh...nnh...? Oh, you were here...?」
％Ｂ
「Gh!? Y-You were awake!?」
Touko
「Mmmh...? What are you freaking out for?」
％Ｂ
「It's just, there was some stuff on your shoulder, you know!? You woke up when I took it off you, so I was just surprised 'cause I thought I might've woken you up!」


Touko
「Oh, really...? Thanks for thaaat...」
％Ｂ
「Y-Yeah, really! Sorry for waking you up!」
Touko
「Oh, no... Not at aaall...」
％Ｂ
「Anyway, sorry for being late again today! Did you fall asleep 'cause you were bored!?」

Touko
「Mmm... I came here... and fell asleep while I was zoning out...」
％Ｂ
「Really... Oh.」
Touko
「Mmm... nyah... It's okay, you can answeeer...」

％Ｂ
「Hello?」
Shuuichi
『Hey. I wanna ask about something.』
％Ｂ
「What is it?」
Shuuichi
『You know about Shionagi Academy's old school building?』
％Ｂ
「Gh... Y-Yeah... I do.」
I give a start.
Did they find out that I've been coming here?
Shuuichi
『That saves me the trouble of explaining, then. The thing is, there are people who want it to be opened up for the Tanabata Festival this year.』

％Ｂ
「Wha...?」
Shuuichi
『Some students asked for it. Those survey forms I had you collect today were to gauge interest in using the old school building.』


％Ｂ
「...And?」
Shuuichi
『Some teachers went in to take a look last week and checked safety stuff with some contractors. It's looking like there's going to be no issue with partially opening it up.』


I recall what happened the other day.
The piece of information I had been missing fits into place, completing the puzzle.
The things they had said when they suddenly showed up in the school building.
So that's what that was about...
Shuuichi
『And so they're going to use the results of that survey from today to make their final decision. That's where I need your help.』

％Ｂ
「...」
Shuuichi
『...Hello? You listening?』
％Ｂ
「Y-Yeah... I'm listening. Hey, does everyone know about this?」

Shuuichi
『No. We're about to let everyone know. There's probably going to be trouble with picking out locations, but we'll make do.』

So only the teachers and the event committee know about this at the moment.
I'll be able to tell Yukimura about this before anyone else, then.
Shuuichi
『So anyway, I'll be counting on you for that. You'll be working on it starting tomorrow.』

Touko
「Work agaaain...? Fuaaahh...gh... You're really busy, aren't you? I'm impressed.」

％Ｂ
「Yukimura. They might be opening up the old school building for the Tanabata Festival.」
Touko
「Wha...?」
％Ｂ
「Remember how the teachers came around last week? That was apparently to see if they could let people in.」

Touko
「...」
％Ｂ
「I don't know the details, but there's a chance they'll partially open this building up. This room might be a part of that plan too.」


Touko
「...I see. This was such a nice place, too. I guess this is the end of our secret meetings too.」

％Ｂ
「...Yukimura?」
Touko
「Things are going to get loud, aren't they? I'd rather find a different, quieter place.」

％Ｂ
「It's still not set in stone. I think we'll know more details in a bit, so...」

Touko
「It's fine. There's no changing what's already been decided. Now then... what should I do from tomorrow onwards?」

％Ｂ
「...Are you really fine with this?」
Touko
「I'm the one who's been sneaking in here. It's not something I can fight them over.」

％Ｂ
「...I don't like it. I... I like spending time with you, here in this building.」

Touko
「Come on, there's nothing I can do about that. I'm just as...」
％Ｂ
「Could you let me handle this, then? I'll figure something out.」

Touko
「...How?」
％Ｂ
「I'm gonna start thinking about it now. So don't give up so easily. You like this place, don't you?」

Touko
「...Really. I'll be waiting, but not expecting much.」
Shuuichi
「Oh, you're back... Wait, what's the matter?」
％Ｂ
「Shuuichi. Give me more details about the old school building.」
Shuuichi
「S-Sure... I was gonna do that even without you asking. What's going on? You suddenly seem crazy motivated.」

％Ｂ
「Just tell me what's going on. What's happening?」
Shuuichi
「Like I said over the phone, there are people who want the old school building opened up as a place for Tanabata Festival displays. There are clubs doing everything they can to try to convince the teachers.」


％Ｂ
「You said it'd just be a partial thing, right? Not the whole building?」
Shuuichi
「You might already know about it, but the old school building's going to be torn down next year. There's a bit of dismantling that's already being done, but opening up just the first floor's apparently fine.」


％Ｂ
「So that means... there's a chance they'll open up all of the first floor then.」

Shuuichi
「That's right. They're going to seal off the second floor, just in case. It's an old building. It wouldn't be a laughing matter if the floor gave way.」

The classroom Yukimura and I are always in is a spot that's hard to see from outside... the furthest-in room on the first floor.

Which means it's also part of the plans to open up the building.
Shuuichi
「If it does end up being used, then we'll get alumni who used to take classes in that building coming for the nostalgia. It'll be good advertisement for the Tanabata Festival.」

％Ｂ
「...Really.」
Shuuichi
「I want you to do some interviews and some simple negotiations for now. I'll put together a list of what you'll be in charge of by tomorrow, so be ready for that.」


all
I wonder if there's a way for me to solve everything.
I've been thinking about it the whole time, but I can't think of a good idea.
There's how Yukimura feels, and how the clubs that want to use the old school building feel.
I can understand how they both feel... which is why I want to try finding a way for them both to be happy.

％Ｂ
「I can't solve this on my own, can I...」
I guess I'll ask Shinozaki and Segawa tomorrow during lunch break.\n \n\r
I'd feel bad if I just asked them for advice without anything in return... I think I'll look up how to make something easy for lunch tomorrow that we can pick at while we discuss the issue.

【％Ｂ】「You got time tomorrow #Nduring lunch? I need #Nsome advice.」
【Marika】「Yeah, I'm free.」
【Natsuki】「I don't have any plans #Neither. Wanna talk in #Nthe courtyard?」
【％Ｂ】「Yeah. I'll bring #Nsomething to snack on.」
【％Ｂ】「I'll look something up #Nand do my best.」
【Natsuki】_st_0201
【Marika】「Are you sure? Won't #Nthat be a lot of work?」
【％Ｂ】「I'll probably manage.」
【％Ｂ】_st_0307
【Marika】_st_0108
【Marika】「I'll look forward to #Nit, okay?」
【Natsuki】「We'll meet tomorrow in #Nthe courtyard, then!」
