The next day.
Shinozaki and I are sitting on the rocks watching Okihara-senpai happily scoop up fish with her net.

Marika
「Hey... Do you know why we're at the ocean again～?」
％Ｂ
「...No clue.」
Marika
「I could swear I said we should go eat together, as thanks for yesterday...」

％Ｂ
「Yeah... I remember you saying that too.」
all
Okihara-senpai's idea for curing the kids' fear of water's apparently been incorporated into the swim class curriculum.

Shinozaki apparently got reimbursed for the sticker costs, as well as a little bonus for suggesting such a wonderful idea.

And so Shinozaki said the three of us should use that money to go eat, but...

Marika
「I wonder how things ended up this way～」
％Ｂ
「Well... It's obviously 'cause you said we should go where Okihara-senpai wanted to go.」

Marika
「I was talking about where we should eat...」
To think we'd end up just tagging along with fishing instead.
Marika
「But I guess this is just like her.」
％Ｂ
「Hm... Yeah, you're right.」
Marika
「I think it's really wonderful that she can pour so much passion into one thing.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah... You're right.」
Marika
「Though... she's a bit eccentric.」
％Ｂ
「Can't disagree with that either.」
Marika
「...If you're going to go for her, now's the time.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, you're right...」
％Ｂ
「...Wait. What?」
Marika
「Okihara-san's so pretty. And her personality's nice too... and her b-boobs are big too.」


％Ｂ
「U-Uh... I hadn't really noticed...」
Marika
「Whaaat? I think it's pretty obvious just from looking～」
...Forget just looking... I actually touched them yesterday.
Marika
「I think you two might be good together, you know.」
％Ｂ
「Wha... What?」
Marika
「Hehe...」
She just smiles as I stare at her in confusion.
I close my mouth. I have no idea what to say.

all
％Ｂ
「...」
...No, that's not right.
It's that I can't respond to her.
Because I don't know myself what I'm thinking.
Misa
「It's a boxfish!」
Okihara-senpai's engrossed in her fish collection, completely unaware of our conversation.

...Seriously. What do I think about all this?
