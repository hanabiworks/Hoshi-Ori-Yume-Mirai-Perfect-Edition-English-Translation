「Ooooh!」
I cry out appreciatively at the sight before me.
Rikka and Meguru-chan are wearing the dresses made for them for the Shio-cademy Fest.
They're trying on the newly finished dresses for the first time.
Handicrafts Club President
「Fufuuun～ Aren't they perfect～?」
％Ｂ
「Yes, they are! Thank you very much!」
all
Rikka
「Hehe... Why are you the one thanking her?」
％Ｂ
「I just couldn't help it from how moved I am... It fits you perfectly. It's really nice and pretty.」

Rikka
「Thank you. Ehehe.」
all
Meguru
「Seeenpai! What about me?」
She twirls once.
The hem of her dress flutters beautifully through the air, like a mermaid's tail.
％Ｂ
「You look cute too, Meguru-chan. It looks great on you.」
Meguru
「Eheheeeh～ ...Thank you very much!」
Rikka
「Thank you very much for creating such wonderful outfits for us.」

Handicrafts Club President
「You don't need to thank us. Thanks from us too for letting us make your outfits. They're the cos club's masterpieces, just like I thought they'd be.」
Handicrafts Club President
「Maaan～ Energy drinks really hit the spot after a good day's work! Ahahahahahahahah!」

Handicrafts Club First-Year
「I'm very sorry... She's a bit crazy right now from working all night.」
Rikka
「You were working all night to make these dresses?」
Handicrafts Club First-Year
「Oh, please don't feel bad. This always happens. We're always right up against deadlines...」

Handicrafts Club First-Year
「Our president is very demanding with what she wants in her outfits... and it was especially bad this year, so she just stayed up for three days. That's all.」

Meguru
「You haven't slept in three days!?」
Handicrafts Club President
「I took naps, you knooow～ About thirty minutes total～」
all
％Ｂ
「That's barely any different from not getting any sleep at all...」
Handicrafts Club President
「I couldn't allow Narusawa-san and her sister to wear something mediocre, nor could I allow myself to make something like that, could I? I'd gladly sacrifice my own body for my work.」


I thought she was kinda weird, but she's definitely a professional.
I can't help but respect her.
Handicrafts Club First-Year
「Anyway, I'll go have her rest in the nurse's office.」
Rikka
「Okay. Thank you. I'll keep all your efforts in mind when I wear this.」

％Ｂ
「Seeing you two wear those dresses really makes me feel like the time's finally come.」

Rikka
「Well, the Shio-cademy Fest is tomorrow.」
Meguru
「It's already been half a month since I've come back. It seems like it's passed in the blink of an eye.」

％Ｂ
「Maybe it's because those days have been just that fulfilling for you.」
Meguru
「You're right. There's no end to my gratitude for you, Senpai, since now I can play together with Onee-chan like this.」
Rikka
「Hehe. It's been nothing but people thanking you for things lately.」
％Ｂ
「It makes me feel a bit ticklish. Not like I've actually done that much.」
Whether it's Rikka or Ousaka and Okihara-senpai, it's all thanks to their own hard work...
All I did was lend just a bit of a helping hand.
％Ｂ
「Oh, look at the time. I gotta get back. Good luck with practice, you two.」

Rikka's been exempted from committee work today so she can focus entirely on practicing.

It's a considerate arrangement on Ishizuka-san's part.
Meguru
「Yes! Thank you very much!」
Rikka
「You too. Have fun.」
Meguru
「Good luck with your work～」
I step out as soothing melodies begin to sound from the music classroom.
％Ｂ
「Let's do this!」
I pump myself up and step forward.
％Ｂ
「―Everything appears to be as stated in your submitted paperwork. There are no issues. Let's all make this a fun Tanabata Festival together.」
I bow and excuse myself from the Tanabata Festival preparations taking place in the classroom.
Marika
「About how many do we have left?」
％Ｂ
「Hmm～ ...We might not be able to go home if we keep going at this rate...」

I let out a sigh when I look at the unchecked items on the list.
We're doing a final check of the festival displays.
We need to compare what's being made or put on to the paperwork that's been submitted to check for differences, deficiencies, or things that need to be changed.

We also need to make sure any cooking and other such equipment is being used correctly and so on, as well as finalize plans for the day of.

Ticking off every little thing on the checklist is taking an unexpectedly long time.

％Ｂ
「I think I get why Shuuichi looked like he was on his deathbed earlier.」
Marika
「Yeah, it'd be hard to do something like this beforehand...」
％Ｂ
「You can go home whenever, Shinozaki. Your parents are gonna worry if you end up staying the night, right?」

Marika
「I wanna help until the end～ I'm a member of the event committee too, you know.」
％Ｂ
「Okay. Then let's do it. But let your family know if it looks like we're gonna be here late, all right?」
Marika
「I know～」
She responds with a smile.
Well, it's Shinozaki we're talking about, so I'm not actually too worried.
Marika
「But it's great that Ousaka-san and Okihara-san were able to finish their display, isn't it?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, it is.」
We finished making the posters and flyers today at around noon.
We got the posters okayed by the student council, ran the flyers through a copier...
And the others told us they could handle putting up the posters themselves, so we started on other committee work.
Marika
「I wonder if lots of people will come.」
％Ｂ
「We've done everything we can. All we can do is just keep doing that tomorrow too.」

Marika
「I'll do my best with trying to attract visitors.」
％Ｂ
「Just make sure you don't end up on the receiving end, all right? I feel like you'd get dragged away somewhere pretty easily.」

Marika
「Uuuh... Why would you say something like that～」
％Ｂ
「Hahaha! All right, let's get to the next one.」
％Ｂ
「Haahhhh～～～ ...I need a break...」
I slump against the wall.
The wall feels nice and cool against my back.
％Ｂ
「But man, we're seriously not gonna finish this... It was probably a good idea to split up.」

Shinozaki and I decided to split up after we both became familiar enough with the checks.

But there are still a lot of items left on the list.
There were a few things that needed to be rechecked too, which means it's looking like this is going to take even longer than expected.

％Ｂ
「Aaah～ ...I wanna see Rikka...」
I bet seeing her would blow all my fatigue away in an instant.
Rikka
「Did you call for me?」
Touch.
％Ｂ
「Hgh!?」
I feel something cold against my cheek.
It's a can of milk tea.
Rikka
「I came to see you, ehehe. Good work. Here, some refreshment.」
％Ｂ
「Thanks. I was actually just thinking I was thirsty.」
％Ｂ
「...Nh, gulp, gulp. Ahhh, I can feel the cold spreading through me～」
Rikka
「I looked around for you. You weren't in the committee office when I went.」
Rikka leans against the wall next to me and pulls the tab on her own can of milk tea.

％Ｂ
「What about practice?」
Rikka
「We're taking a short break. I wanted to see your face, and that's when I came across someone saying something very similar to himself, hehehe.」

She smiles bashfully.
Rikka
「How's work?」
％Ｂ
「It's going steady... is what I wanna say, but I think this is gonna take a while. I might have to stay the night.」
％Ｂ
「How about you?」
Rikka
「Meguru and I are planning to keep playing today until we're satisfied. But... maybe I should help you out a bit too?」

％Ｂ
「You've got something only you can do right now, right?」
I pet her on the head to reassure her.
％Ｂ
「Though if you wanna do something for me, then could you come see me on your break again?」

％Ｂ
「Seeing your face gets me motivated.」
Rikka
「Mhm... And I'll come to get lots of energy from you too.」
She places her head on my shoulder and rubs her cheek on me.
％Ｂ
「We're in the hallway, you know.」
Rikka
「But there isn't anyone here, is there?」
％Ｂ
「That's true...」
We're the only ones here as far as I can see. Maybe it's because this hallway's a bit far from the rest of the school.

Rikka glances around again, and...
Rikka
「Mm... chu.」
Tastes like milk tea.
Rikka
「Good luck. Don't overexert yourself, okay?」
％Ｂ
「Think I could get the kiss as a bonus every time you come see me?」
Rikka
「Just listen to you talk, geez... I will if no one's around, okay? And what are you going to do for me when I come see you?」

％Ｂ
「How about I hold you tight?」
Rikka
「...Like how?」
She looks up at me pleadingly.
She's gotten better at this since we started dating.
She's so incredibly cute.
％Ｂ
「Like this.」
I pull her close and wrap myself tightly around her.
Rikka
「...Mh, fh... It's warm.」
％Ｂ
「It's almost a bit hot, actually.」
The hallway's pretty warm already from the summer sunlight streaming in.
Rikka
「Mmhhh... Tactless.」
％Ｂ
「Haha, sorry. Is this enough for you to forgive me?」
I pet the back of her head.
Rikka
「Ehehe... I forgive you.」
She's so happy that I'm sure she'd be wagging her tail if she had one.

And... she looks despondent when I stop petting her.
Rikka
「Could you... pet me for just a little longer?」
％Ｂ
「Sure.」
Pet pet.
Rikka
「Hehehe, hehe, ehehe～♪」
She closes her eyes dreamily.
Rikka
「I love it when you pet me on the head... It feels sooo nice...」
I like petting Rikka's hair too.
Her hair has a nice sweet fragrance, and it feels silky and smooth.

And so our breaks also became valuable to us in a way other than rest.
It's currently past midnight.
I can still see a few lit rooms throughout the school building.
Those are the groups who are staying the night here to prepare for tomorrow.
I'm lethargically eating cup ramen.
Shuuichi
「This kinda reminds me of training camp for soccer...」
％Ｂ
「That sucked 'cause it was all guys. Don't you think it's a little better than that since we have some girls here?」


Natsuki
「What are you complaining for with this many beautiful ladies around you? It's not just a little better, this is Shangri-La! Right, Marika?」

Marika
「M-Mhm... I... hope so?」
all
Sora
「I've never stayed over at school before.」

Misa
「Me neither! It's very fun, like a school trip!」
Even Ousaka and the others helped us out, even though they're not part of the committee.
Which was really helpful, because we just didn't have enough people in general.
We're currently taking a break to eat in the quiet second chemistry classroom so we don't get in the way of the other committee members' work.

all
Touko
「...I wanna go to the convenience store.」

Shuuichi
「Feel free to go if you've got the energy...」
Touko
「If we did, we wouldn't be eating cup ramen.」
％Ｂ
「I don't feel like doing anything anymore...」
all
I'm all out of mental energy. It's too much trouble to even go home.
The last bus home left a while ago anyway.
That's why I've decided to stay the night at school.
Rikka
「Good work today. Oh, good. We just happened to catch you when you were eating.」
Rikka and Meguru-chan walk in.
I can smell something good from the two of them...
Meguru
「Great work today! We've made rice balls for you all!」

Touko
「Fresh-made rice balls! Salmon! Do you have salmon!?」
Meguru
「This one is salmon.」
Yukimura immediately grabs the indicated rice ball, her eyes glittering.
The others all crowd around the two of them.
all
Marika
「Ahaha... I guess we all still had a lot of energy... Could I have one too, Narusawa-san?」


Rikka
「Mhm. Of course.」
all
Sora
「...Pickled plum.」
Rikka
「Here you go. Pickled plum.」
Sora
「...Thanks.」
all
Misa
「I would like to have kelp.」
Rikka
「Yes, we have that. The ones in this row.」
The event committee members take one rice ball after another from the plate.

all
％Ｂ
「Where'd you even make these?」
Rikka
「The home ec classroom. The teacher in charge of it let us use it after we explained what we wanted to do.」
％Ｂ
「But it must've been a lot of work to make this much, right?」
Rikka
「It was fun to make them together with Meguru, hehe. Doing things together with everyone and eating together... is nice, isn't it?」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, it is.」
The two of us watch everyone eat their rice balls.
Their tired faces light up with smiles.
Shuuichi
「These rice balls are really good! I think I'll have another.」
all
％Ｂ
「Agh, hey! They're almost all gone already! Leave some for me!」

Rikka
「Hehe. This one is yours.」
all
Rikka holds out a separate rice ball from the ones on the tray. It's a decent amount bigger than the other ones.

Rikka
「It's filled with grilled roe around here, and salmon here, and kelp too. I'm allowed to show a little favoritism for my hardworking boyfriend, right? Hehehe.」
％Ｂ
「Thanks. This is getting me motivated. By the way, are you guys done with practice already?」

Rikka
「Fortunately, yes.」
％Ｂ
「Really. So that means you're satisfied with how it's turned out then.」
Rikka
「Expect good things for tomorrow. We'll put on a wonderful performance for all of you.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, I'm looking forward to it! Piano concerts are formal, right? Should I wear a suit?」

Rikka
「Hehe. Stupid.」
Her gentle voice caresses my ear.
all
Shuuichi
「Fueled up and ready to go! Let's get back to work. Ryousuke, stop flirting with Narusawa over there and help me with this paperwork.」
Shuuichi
「Fueled up and ready to go! Let's get back to work. You stop flirting with Narusawa over there and help me with this paperwork.」
％Ｂ
「Wait a second. I haven't eaten my rice ball yet. Angh... hamh, nmh, nmh.」

all
％Ｂ
「Ugh. I wanted to savor this, too.」
Rikka
「I'll make it for you again. Oh, hehe. You have some on your face. Stay still.」

She reaches toward the corner of my mouth...
Rikka
「Amh.」
And pops it in her own mouth.
Natsuki
「Did you see that, madam? She just reached up, grabbed rice off her boyfriend's lips, and ate it! Just like that!」
Touko
「How increeedibly scandalous. I must say, I'm worried for Shionagi's future.」
Sora
「...Tomorrow's the festival. We can't blame them for being excited.」
Rikka
「Aah, uh... It was out of habit...」

Misa
「Do you do that all the time?」
Okihara-senpai looks at Rikka with a pure, innocent expression, and asks a decisively difficult question.
Rikka
「Wha, huh...? Oh, j-just every now and then. It's not like he's always getting food stuck to his face anyway!」


Touko
「I'm taking that to mean it's an automatic response to eat it if he does get food on his face.」
Rikka
「Hgh. Uuuuhh～」
all
Meguru
「What's with that, Senpai!?」
％Ｂ
「Meguru-chan. Your actual personality's showing.」
Meguru
「I don't care about that! I want you to explain what's going on here!」

％Ｂ
「Fufufu... Jealous? I bet you are.」
Meguru
「I am jealous! I am way too jealous! I want Onee-chan to take rice off my face too! I would also be open for it being reversed, with me eating rice off of Onee-chan's face!」
Rikka
「Geez, don't rile Meguru up too much.」

Touko
「Your little sister's fun, Piano-chan. Can I call her Model 2-chan?」
％Ｂ
「Model 2?」
Touko
「We already have a Piano-chan, right? So she's Piano-chan Model 2. Model 2-chan. It's okay, right?」

Meguru
「Oh, yes. I don't mind.」
all
Natsuki
「I see... So you have both Piano-chan and Model 2-chan... What a nice position to be in.」

％Ｂ
「...You know what, don't call her that.」
It makes me sound like an absolute womanizer.

Shuuichi
「Sigh... I don't care, can we just do some work?」
all
？？？／律佳
「Hey... Ryousuke. Ryousuke...」
？？？／律佳
「Hey... Hey...」
％Ｂ
「Aah...?」
I hear a gentle voice from above while I'm nodding off against the wall of the music classroom after getting my work done.
％Ｂ
「Wha, Rikka... I thought you were sleeping in the tea ceremony room.」
We weren't about to have the girls just sleep on the floor, so we had them use the tea ceremony room with its tatami mats.

The guys are just all getting sleep wherever.
I chose to be in the quiet music classroom.
Rikka
「It may be summer, but that doesn't mean you still can't catch a cold. I brought you a towel blanket.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, great. Thanks.」
I hold out my hand to take it from her, but she sits down next to me instead.
Rikka
「Let's use it together.」
The two of us curl up under the same blanket.
Rikka
「It was thanks to everyone's support that I was able to come this far... but you were always the one who created opportunities so they could support me in the first place.」

％Ｂ
「?」
Rikka
「I was thinking about our conversation from earlier today. It's not just Meguru and Ousaka-san who are grateful to you. I'm really grateful too... Thank you.」

％Ｂ
「Mhm.」
Rikka brings her head closer and leans against me.
I lightly plunk my head down onto hers too.
％Ｂ
「Hey, Rikka. What are you gonna...」
Rikka
「Hm?」
％Ｂ
「No. I'll ask you about that later.」
Rikka
「You can't just cut yourself off like that... What am I going to do if worrying about what you were going to say gets in the way of my performance tomorrow?」

％Ｂ
「Wha... Seriously? That wouldn't be good.」
Rikka
「I'm kidding, hehe. But you said you'd ask me later, so make sure you do, okay?」

％Ｂ
「Yeah.」
What I wanted to ask was―
What Rikka's going to do after her Tanabata Festival performance.
Is she going to try to become a professional pianist once again?
But for now, I just want her to be able to focus on her performance tomorrow without anything bothering her.
Rikka
「...」
This is nice.
The quiet of the music classroom... We've spent a lot of time here together.
Rikka
「I can see the stars... I didn't know you could see them so clearly from this room.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, we've never stayed here until night before. I guess the latest we've been here was back when I fell asleep and you waited for me to wake up?」

We stayed late that day, but not nearly this late.
％Ｂ
「You mind if I ask something way overdue?」
Rikka
「What is it?」
％Ｂ
「You were waiting for me to wake up back then, right?」
Rikka
「...Mhm. You'd have been sad if you woke up and no one was there, right? But you looked so comfortable sleeping that I would've felt bad to wake you up...」

％Ｂ
「Haha.」
Rikka
「Why are you laughing?」
％Ｂ
「Well, I dunno. That just really sounds just like you.」
Rikka hasn't changed at all on the inside.
She's always been a really kind girl, ever since I first met her.\n\r
All that's changed since then is that I know that now.
It seems like it was inevitable that I'd fall in love with her.

Rikka
「Oh... A shooting star!」
all
％Ｂ
「Wha, where?」
Rikka
「It disappeared while you were laughing.」
％Ｂ
「I wanted to make a wish, too.」
Rikka
「What kind of wish?」
％Ｂ
「It's a secret. It won't come true if I say it out loud.」
％Ｂ
「Did you make a wish just now?」
Rikka
「I tried, but it disappeared before I could repeat it three times. Mine's a secret too, because I wouldn't want for it not to come true, hehe.」

And then...
We see a glint of light as another star streaks through the sky.
％Ｂ
「...」
Rikka
「...」
The two of us both silently make our wishes.
Unfortunately, I couldn't repeat mine three times before the star disappeared.
"I wish for Rikka and Meguru-chan's performance tomorrow to be the best it can possibly be."

Strangely enough, I feel like Rikka was wishing the same thing as me.
So I change my wish to a vow.
"I'll make Rikka and Meguru-chan's performance tomorrow the best it can possibly be."
