Touko
「We have an announcement! We're getting married!」

％Ｂ
「Bffh!?」
Touko announces our engagement to the entire firm at the beginning of our morning meeting.
I was going to find a good time to say it myself... And now the topic of conversation's immediately become extremely private right off the bat.


Azuma
「So you two are finally getting married. You seemed like you were thinking over that ring a lot too... Weren't you gonna give her the ring on her birthday?」


％Ｂ
「Oh, well... Um, some things came up...」
Touko
「I proposed to him yesterday before he could. He gave me the ring right after that. See!」

She proudly shows off her ring.
Everyone looks at me in unison.
Azuma
「...You're okay with that, as a man? You made a woman wait for so long she proposed to you first?」

％Ｂ
「...Please don't. I was already really depressed yesterday over the exact same thing...」

Ugh... It's painful to have everyone looking at me...
Now they're gonna add "the guy who made a girl propose to him" to the list of material to make fun of me with...!

Firm Staff A
「Well, I think it's fine since it sounds just like you. Hope you live out a happy life with Touko-chan running you.」

％Ｂ
「...Thank you very much.」
Azuma
「Speaking of which, I heard you got dumped by your girlfriend last week. Have them share some of the happiness with you.」

Firm Staff A
「Why would you bring that up now!? I'm trying so hard to forget about that!」

Touko
「Ahahah! I hope you can all come to the ceremony! Oh, would you like to participate in the bouquet toss with the girls? I can have a special seat ready for you.」


Azuma
「...Stop it. I'd rather die than have you two shower me with pity.」

Plus, he's married...
The idea of him participating in the bouquet toss is possibly the funniest thing I've ever imagined, but it'd be problematic in a lot of ways, so let's not.

Azuma
「I'll make an opportunity to celebrate for you two formally sometime. And I hope you two work hard here, for the sake of your bright future as a married couple.」

Touko
「...Ehehe.」
Touko's been looking at her left hand and grinning every few minutes or so.\n \n\r
I think it probably isn't good that she's distracted from work... but I can't help but smile knowing she's just that happy.

all
Firm Staff A
「...Mr. Azuma. I don't wanna be around those two.」
Azuma
「Don't be that way. Let them enjoy themselves for a bit.」
Firm Staff A
「No, I know, but...! I didn't drink even a single drop last night... but the heartburn...! I'm at my limit and it's still morning...!」


Azuma
「I see. You can have this, then. It works for hangovers, stomach pain, and heartburn, so it should help at least a little.」

Firm Staff A
「...Thank you very much.」
all
I can't just spend all day out of it like this.
I need to do what needs doing, or else I won't be able to bring about our happy future.

％Ｂ
「Touko, I need you to do this. We're giving them to the client the day after tomorrow, so have it done by today.」

Touko
「Okaaay. I think I can finish it by this evening, so I'll need you to do the final check once I'm done.」
I hand her a USB drive.
She whispers in my ear as she takes it.
Touko
「...Let's finish our work early today. And... spoil me lots today again, okay?」

％Ｂ
「...You've got it.」
...I'm starting to feel crazy motivated.
I think I'll be able to pound out a new record for efficiency today.
all
Azuma
「...Hey. Go to the drugstore and get like five dozen of those drinks I gave you.」

Firm Staff A
「...Okay. You're footing the bill.」
