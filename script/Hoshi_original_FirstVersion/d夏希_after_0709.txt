Natsuki
「I'm hoooome!」
％Ｂ
「Hey, welcome home. I made dinner already. We're having curry tonight.」


Natsuki
「Thank yooou! Mmm... Chu♪ Chu♪ Chuuu♪」
Three consecutive welcome-home kisses.
Yeah, I know. We're still super lovey-dovey.
Natsuki
「Actually, there's something I want you to look at before we eat.」
％Ｂ
「Oh? Actually, same for me.」
Natsuki
「Oh, really? Then what do you wanna do? Wanna eat first?」

％Ｂ
「No, we can always just warm it back up again, so let's get this stuff over with first.」

Natsuki
「Sounds good. You can start, then.」

％Ｂ
「Sure. One sec, then.」

all
I pick my sketchbook up from the couch and show Natsuki the pages as I flip through.

％Ｂ
「I tried drafting some rough design sketches for that competition I was talking about before, so I wanted to show you.」

Natsuki
「Oh, I wanna see, I wanna see! Show me!」
I hand her the sketchbook, and she starts looking through it with serious eyes.

％Ｂ
「I tried to incorporate as many of the things you said you'd want as I could.」

％Ｂ
「I used a lot of the plot's coverage to design a house that's as wide open as possible. There's two kids' rooms, and I designed the center of the house to be an atrium.」

％Ｂ
「There's interior windows in each of the rooms, and skylights in the main bedroom and the kids' rooms, so the moon can shine in at night.」

％Ｂ
「And this is that big bath you said you'd want, and an island-design kitchen too. Each of the rooms has storage rooms that are pretty big, with hidden shelves.」


Natsuki
「Wooow. This is seriously our ideal home!」

％Ｂ
「Though that's just 'cause I tried throwing in every idea you gave me.」

％Ｂ
「Now I'll need to start deciding what's really necessary and what's not. I'll need to think about the overall balance of the design as a whole.」


Natsuki
「Do you? I think this is already pretty good, though.」

％Ｂ
「This is just my design right now. I'll need to add Azuma-san's aesthetics too.」

Natsuki
「Why does it need to be in his style? It's a competition, so why don't you just go all out with your own personal style?」





％Ｂ
「'Cause the clients specifically want Azuma-san's design for their home.」

％Ｂ
「Azuma-san's given us an opportunity with this competition, but he's not gonna just immediately suggest the winning design to the clients.」


％Ｂ
「Azuma-san's gonna brush things up from there, and in the end he'll propose it as his―as the Azuma Morio Architectural Firm's design to the clients.」


％Ｂ
「So first I have to make sure the design aligns with the firm's style. That's a must. I'm still a member of the Azuma Morio Architectural Firm, after all.」


Natsuki
「Huh, I get it. You've considered all of that too? Huh～」


％Ｂ
「...Is it really that weird for me to do that much?」
Natsuki
「Because you're technically a creator, right? Though you're still just someone who makes tea right now.


」

％Ｂ
「You sure don't hold back, do you...?」
Natsuki
「You know how creative types hate mimicking others and always try to come off as unique, right? By making completely selfish things and stuff.」


％Ｂ
「Yeah, there are people like that.」
Natsuki
「But you're making sure you hold yourself back, and you're doing work as a professional member of your firm. It's unexpected, but I'm impressed.」





％Ｂ
「Are you? I don't really think it's anything that unexpected, though.」


Natsuki
「No, you're doing a good thing. Good boy, good boy.」

She gently pets my head.
％Ｂ
「R-Right... Thanks.」
％Ｂ
「...Though if I'm being honest, I do wanna let my own personal style show through. But I don't have that kinda skill, and there's still lots of stuff I need to study up on.」


％Ｂ
「Well, I guess the best-case scenario for this is that my ideas are included for even one part of Azuma-san's final design.」


Natsuki
「Mhm, mhm. It's good to be humble. The world's a rough place, after all.」

％Ｂ
「Same for you, right? So what'd you wanna show me?」

Natsuki
「Oh, right! I took a few photos for that contest. I wanted you to look at them.」


％Ｂ
「Oh, you've been taking photos for that? You never said anything about it after you brought it up, so I was wondering how it was going.」


Natsuki
「I've been doing my due diligence. I printed them out so you could look at them. Let's see, just one second...」


all
She takes a simple-looking photo album out from her bag.
％Ｂ
「The theme's "smiles," right?」
Natsuki
「Yep, yep. Here you go.」
all
She hands me the album. I open it to see photos of various "smiles."

A cat that looks like it's smiling.
A dog in the middle of coming back after fetching a ball.
A cloud in the shape of a smile.
The smile logo of some company.
A doodle drawn in the sand by a child.
A rusted old sign.
A young couple smiling at each other.
An elderly couple smiling at each other.
A married couple smiling at each other.
And a simple photo of a child smiling.
Natsuki
「Well? What do you think? Give me your honest feedback.」

％Ｂ
「...I'll be honest then, okay?」
Natsuki
「Of course! You already know you don't need to hesitate about that, don't you?」


％Ｂ
「Okay. These photos are all fun, and they go with the theme of "smiles."」


Natsuki
「Hmhm.」
％Ｂ
「Each of these "smiles" is definitely a nice smile.」
Natsuki
「Hmhm!」
％Ｂ
「But I feel like that's all.」
Natsuki
「H...Hmhm...」
％Ｂ
「How do I say it? ...I guess I can't see the context. Take this photo of these women smiling, for example. Why are they smiling?」


Natsuki
「Uh... That one's... They smiled because the person they were waiting for just happened to show up as they agreed to let me take their photo.」

％Ｂ
「Then I think you could've communicated the meaning behind their smiles better by including the person they were waiting for in the shot too.」

Natsuki
「Uuh... Oh, but what about this one with the dog? Isn't this one easy to understand?」

％Ｂ
「It just looks like it's smiling 'cause it's holding a ball in its mouth, right? It's more like a cutesy joke photo. Actually, this dog's eyes don't look like it's smiling... It's kinda scary.」


Natsuki
「Auh...」
She must've realized all of this on her own already. She shrinks down in response to my comments.
％Ｂ
「...It's just my opinion as a layman, but don't you think you could add some depth by having something like a message in the photo?」

Natsuki
「Something like a message, huh...」
％Ｂ
「You know, like "A Bridge of Prayers." I think that had something like a message in it. What were you thinking back when you took that one?」


Natsuki
「I remember I wanted everyone to be able to make wishes whenever they wanted when I took it.」

％Ｂ
「Mhm, I think that's the thing. I think you might naturally have a message in your photo if you think about what you want people to think while they're looking at it.」


Natsuki
「...What I want people to think while they're looking at it...」
％Ｂ
「My bad. I sound kinda full of it, don't I?」
Natsuki
「No, I'm glad you said it. Thanks so much. Chu♪」

She gives me a peck on the cheek.
Natsuki
「I'll try thinking about it from other angles for now.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, that's probably a good idea. Anyway, let's have dinner. I'll get the curry warmed back up, so you go get changed in the meantime.」


Natsuki
「Mhm, got it.」
all
She walks over toward the closet to get changed.

Natsuki
「Oh yeah, by the way.」
％Ｂ
「Hm?」
Natsuki
「I'm going to go see Marika and Rikka this Sunday. We're gonna have a meeting for the class reunion and have a girls' night out too.」

％Ｂ
「Oh, really? You should just invite them over.」
Natsuki
「I said girls' night, didn't I? You can't be there. Oh, but you can if you cross-dress.」

％Ｂ
「Hope the three of you have fun together. Anyway, you're not gonna need dinner on Sunday, then?」

Natsuki
「Actually, I'll be home by then.」
％Ｂ
「Got it. Then I'll be waiting with food ready.」
Natsuki
「Mhm. I'll come home as early as I can.」
