Today is Sunday.
Now that I'm finished with cleaning and laundry, I've decided to study up on stars through the internet after eating lunch.

$$smh_OpenCHK
I'll be more helpful to the astronomy club and to Ousaka if I know more about stars.

That's if she decides to participate in the Tanabata Festival, of course.
％Ｂ
「Hm... What's this? A video about how big celestial objects are?」
Looks like some kind of movie where it shows you the relative sizes of the stars and planets. Sounds interesting.

％Ｂ
「Let's take a look.」
I click the link and play the video.
Looks like it's in English.
Everything's named in English too.
％Ｂ
「Oh, looks like they're starting with the moon.」
％Ｂ
「Next is... Mercury. I always kinda imagined Mercury being blue, but I guess it's more dirt-colored.」

％Ｂ
「Next is... Mars. Yep, just as red as I figured.」
％Ｂ
「This one's Venus. The Morning and Evening Star, right? It has a nice gold color.」

％Ｂ
「Oh, there's Earth! Mmmhm, it really is a pretty planet, isn't it?」

％Ｂ
「Whoa... What the heck!? This one's huge! Nep...Neptu... This is Neptune? It's blue like the ocean...」

％Ｂ
「Whoa!? This one's even bigger!? It's Saturn! Wait a second. I thought Saturn had rings...」

Oh, wait. I see "without rings" in the description.


So it's this big even without its rings...
％Ｂ
「This one's Jupiter. It's got a nice woody color to it.」
％Ｂ
「Hm... There's something written here. Let's see... I guess it's saying that was all planets, and the stars are next?」

％Ｂ
「Wow! The Sun! Holy crap, it's huge! The Sun's huge! It's on a completely different scale!」

I had no idea the Sun was this big...
％Ｂ
「Wait, this one's even bigger! What's this? It's bright and white! Sirius... Wait, what? I'm pretty sure that was one of Ousaka's cookies...」


％Ｂ
「But Sirius wasn't even that big compared to the other cookies...」

％Ｂ
「Agh, there's an even bigger one! This one's... Pollux? The heck's that?」

％Ｂ
「Next is... A, R, C... Arcturus...? That must be the married star Ousaka told me about before over LIME.」

After that comes Aldebaran, Rigel, then Antares.
It makes me strangely happy to see the stars Ousaka told me about.
And the last star appears with Earth for scale.

％Ｂ
「Oh man, Earth's soooo tiny! This VY-whatever's huge! Earth's just a flea! Space is amaziiing!」

And that's the end of the video.
％Ｂ
「Hahhh... That was crazy...」
Man, I got way too excited about that...
％Ｂ
「Uhh... I got really worked up... The heck am I doing...?」
I wonder if Ousaka's seen this video before?
％Ｂ
「...Maybe I'll tell her about it!」
I pull out my phone, start up LIME, and start typing up a message to Ousaka.

Hey, I saw this video comparing the sizes of
... No, maybe I shouldn't.
I'm currently waiting for her answer to my confession.
Trying to contact her right now might make it seem like I'm rushing her, which wouldn't be good.
％Ｂ
「And I bet she's seen it already anyway...」
％Ｂ
「Oh...!」
Is that Ousaka...!?
％Ｂ
「Wait... Shinozaki...?」
【Marika】「Wanna come over for #Ndinner tonight?」
【％Ｂ】「You sure? I don't want #Nyour dad to yell at me #Nagain.」
【Marika】「It's okay! My dad's not #Nhere today, so you #Ndon't have to worry～」
【Marika】_st_0109
【％Ｂ】「Got it. I'll come over, #Nthen. What time?」
【Marika】「Anytime before 7's #Nfine. See you then.」
【％Ｂ】「Okay. See you! Looking #Nforward to the food.」
【％Ｂ】_st_0314
【Marika】_st_0103
％Ｂ
「Thanks for the food. Tell your mom it was amazing.」

Marika
「Mhm. My mom was happy too. She was saying having a boy come over makes the cooking more worth it because boys eat lots. Come over again, okay?」


％Ｂ
「Yeah, I will.」
Marika
「The moon's so pretty. The weather's supposed to be nice again tomorrow.」
We look up at the night sky.
％Ｂ
「...Speaking of, remember that time we watched the stars together in the park?」

Marika
「What? The stars? I never watched the stars with you when we were small
, Hino-kun

.」

％Ｂ
「Wha... Huh? Really?」
Marika
「Think about it. I couldn't go outside much back then.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, you're right... Wait, but... That's weird. I feel like I remember something like that...」

Marika
「Oh, but there was one time you talked to me about stars. You were making up weird constellations that I had never heard of before.」

％Ｂ
「Uhh... Did I?」
Marika
「Mhm. There was an airplane constellation, a missile constellation, and a monster constellation.」
％Ｂ
「A monster constellation...」
Ousaka would probably get mad at me if she heard about that.
Marika
「But you knew the Summer Triangle. You said it was a symbol of summer nights that you make by connecting the brightest stars in three constellations. Though you were pointing at the wrong stars...」


％Ｂ
「O-Oh, really... Yeah, I didn't know anything other than the name until just recently.」
all
Huh... But that's weird.
I'm pretty sure I was watching the stars with someone in the park back then...\n\r
It was the day of a festival... but wait, why was I at the park back then?
I can't really remember that well...
I guess I can't help it if my childhood memories are muddled.
Marika
「Do you know the Summer Triangle properly now?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. Let's see... First, you find Vega, right? ...There it is. That big, bright star's Vega in Lyra. And then you'll see Altair in Aquila if you go down and to the right.」


％Ｂ
「And then if you go to the left, there's Deneb in Cygnus. Connect those three stars, and that's the Summer Triangle.」

Marika
「Wooow～! You know it really well～ Have you been studying?」
％Ｂ
「Pretty much. Though it's just Ousaka telling me stuff.」
Marika
「Oh, I knew it. Ousaka-san knows so much. How's that going? Do you think she'll join the Tanabata Festival?」

％Ｂ
「Well... Nothing on that front yet.」
Marika
「Really～ It'd be nice if she could participate～」
％Ｂ
「Yeah... It would be. I'll try harder so I can get her to.」

Marika
「Mhm, good luck～」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. See you tomorrow, then. Night.」
Marika
「Good night. See you～」
