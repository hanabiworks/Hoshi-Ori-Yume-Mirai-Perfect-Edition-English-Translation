％Ｂ
「...I can't find it.」
It's not in my desk.
It's not in my bag.
It's not anywhere!!
％Ｂ
「Must've been when I was studying ahead for math last night...」
I seem to have left my textbook on my desk at home.

This is when having friends in other classes comes in handy.
％Ｂ
「I'll borrow Shuuichi's.」
Shuuichi
「You should be the one letting me borrow yours, actually.」
％Ｂ
「What the hell, you forgot yours too!? And why are you so smug about it!?」

％Ｂ
「Kh, next option then! I'll borrow Shinozaki's!」
Shuuichi
「If she lets you borrow hers, then let me get it next.」
％Ｂ
「Ask her yourself.」
％Ｂ
「Dammit... Damn you, Segawa...」
Segawa's having fun talking with the girls around her. She's got a math textbook out in front of her.

That textbook is Shinozaki's. I was an instant too late.
all
I tried asking some other people, but it was a complete bust.
I came back, unable to secure a textbook for myself.
I wanna avoid sitting through class without a textbook at this point, after only just recently transferring in.

Narusawa walks back into our classroom one minute before the bell.
％Ｂ
「There's no other choice.」
I didn't want to do this, since I felt like it'd attract attention, but I'm going to hedge my bets on my final hope.

I put on a generous, overly warm smile and approach Narusawa after she sits down.

％Ｂ
「Narusawa-san, may I perhaps take up a bit of your time?」
Rikka
「...You may not.」
She looks at me dubiously and curtly refuses.

％Ｂ
「Please don't be that way. Just a little bit is fine. If you would please have it in your heart to listen to the woes of an unworthy soul.」

Rikka
「An unworthy... What's going on here?」
Rikka
「Sigh... I'll listen to what you have to say, so just stop talking like that. It's gross.」

I decide to talk normally. I was also thinking it sounded gross.

％Ｂ
「I forgot my math textbook! Please let me look off yours!」
Rikka
「Why didn't you just say so from the beginning?」
％Ｂ
「A bunch of people have already said no to me, and you're my only remaining option. You understand why I'd act like that, right?」
Rikka
「Honestly. Yes, fine. Here, put your desk next to mine.」
％Ｂ
「Thanks.」
all
I slide my desk over so it makes contact with Narusawa's.
That just happens to be when the bell rings, and our math teacher walks in.
Our classmates keep glancing at Narusawa and me.
...Yeah, I expected this to happen. A guy and a girl have their desks pushed together.

Narusawa's been looking out the window ever since class started.
I thought I was in the clear after she said okay without much argument, but maybe she's mad after all?

I write something in the margins of my notebook and tap her on the shoulder.
Rikka
「...Huh?」
Her face is a bit red when she turns to look at me.
Maybe it's because she was taking in the rays from the early summer sun.
She looks down at my notebook when I point to it.
"Do you want me to pull my desk away?"
She adds her own small, pretty, girly handwriting below.
"Why?"
"You look like you're hating this"
Rikka
「...That's not...」
"I wouldn't have said okay in the first place if that were the case"
"But you've been looking the other way this whole time"
"That's because"
Her pen pauses.
That's because...? Because what?
Math Teacher
「―For this next question... Narusawa, try answering it.」
Rikka
「...! Yes.」
She stands up after being called on.
％Ｂ
「...」
It's an incredibly subtle detail.
The kind of thing you can only feel like you have a hunch about.
So subtle that I'm not even sure myself how I realized it.
But Narusawa seems hesitant.
I look at the problem on the board. This is perfect. These are all problems that use the formulas I reviewed yesterday.

I know how to do these problems.
I scribble the formula and answer as legibly as I can into my notebook, and slide it onto her desk.

Rikka
「Oh... If ∠A is θ degrees, then cos θ＝1/2, and so―」



She sees what I've written and uses it to explain the problem.
Math Teacher
「Looks like you've got a good grasp of this. You can sit.」
Thank god. It was correct.
She sits down noiselessly after being bid to sit by the teacher.
She glances sidelong at me and starts writing in my notebook again.

"Thank you"
"You're very welcome"
The unfinished sentence from before stands out to me.
I want to know what comes after "That's because."
"What were you going to write earlier?"
I tap at the unfinished sentence with my pen.
Rikka
「...」
"I was embarrassed"
all
She then turns her gaze out the window again.
％Ｂ
「Mmhhhh...」
I already know that Narusawa gets embarrassed pretty easily, despite how she looks. This isn't something to be surprised about.
It's probably because she was embarrassed about the attention she was getting from our classmates...

But on the other hand, what if it was because it was me who was next to her? ...Though that's exactly the kinda thing that a guy without a girlfriend would wanna believe...


Either way, there's no way the possibility is nothing more than a conceited delusion.
All it does is leave me feeling weird.
Which means...
...This is all just confusing me even more.
Shuuichi walks into our classroom during lunch break.
Shuuichi
「I was wondering, did you end up getting a textbook? What'd you do for class?」
％Ｂ
「I looked off of Narusawa's.」
Shuuichi
「Hohoh, Narusawa's. Now that's impressive.」
He nods over and over admiringly.
Shuuichi
「Anyway, we can talk about that later. Let's get some food, man. Not like you've got plans to eat with someone anyway, right?」

％Ｂ
「Didn't your mother teach you any manners? But fine, I guess I'll take pity on you for not having any friends and eat with you.」

Shuuichi
「Now we're talking.」
％Ｂ
「We going to the cafeteria? Or you wanna get something from the school store and eat somewhere else?」
Shuuichi
「I've already got food, so you go buy yours. I'll wait for you.」
Shuuichi seems about 80 percent more sparkly than usual. And in his hand is a cute-looking little...

％Ｂ
「...Shuuichi-kun. What might that be in your hand there?」
Shuuichi
「Oh, you noticed? Tehee, Kaori-san made this for me. I guess you could call it a love lunchbox?」


％Ｂ
「Wait a second... You better not have come here just to show that off.」
Shuuichi
「Hahaha! Whatever could you be implying?」
％Ｂ
「Drraassshaaaaaahhh!!」
I launch a flying kick at that sparkly face of his.
But he blocks it with his arm while skillfully defending his lunchbox. His face is still obnoxiously sparkly.

all
％Ｂ
「I'm gonna splurge on lunch today.」
I'd feel like I lost otherwise.
It's the pathetic, stubborn pride of a man.
Shuuichi
「I know. Narusawa, you wanna come with for lunch? Act now, and as a limited-time offer, you'll get 

Ryousuke 
this guy 
too.」
％Ｂ
「What am I, a pack-in deal?」
Rikka
「...I'll have to decline.」
Narusawa grabs her own lunchbox and leaves the classroom.
She probably went to the music classroom like she always does.
Shuuichi
「Hmmh... Must've been because I was here.」
％Ｂ
「You say that like you think she would've said yes if it were just me.」

Shuuichi
「Well she would've, right? I was in Narusawa's class last year, but I've never seen her get along with someone as well as she does with you.」


％Ｂ
「You think so?」
Shuuichi
「You didn't even realize?」
％Ｂ
「Well, I do kinda feel like we've been talking to each other a lot lately.」

Now that he mentions it, I might at least be closer to her than any of the other guys are.

％Ｂ
「...Hm? Uh...」
I've realized that fact makes me feel a bit warmer, deep down in my heart.
Shuuichi
「What's wrong?」
％Ｂ
「No, nothing. Let's go eat lunch.」
all
Wonder what I should get for lunch today.
