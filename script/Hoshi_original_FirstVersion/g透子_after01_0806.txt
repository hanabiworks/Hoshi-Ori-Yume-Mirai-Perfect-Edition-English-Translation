Touko
「Wow...! It's been suuuch a long time!」
Touko and I have come to Shionagi Academy for the first time in a while.
We got weirdly hyped up off of nostalgia on the way here just from walking the route we used to take to school.

％Ｂ
「It hasn't changed at all... Man, this is crazy nostalgic.」

Touko
「Mhm, it is. It really hasn't changed. I guess... we're the ones who've changed since back then.」

The school's bustling with the Tanabata Festival. We feel as if we've been transported back to the past.

I can see shadows of ourselves in the students wearing the Shionagi Academy uniforms.
The sparkling pages of the golden years of our youth come back to mind in vivid detail.

Touko
「Hey, where do you wanna go? I wonder if the event committee office is still a thing.」

％Ｂ
「They're not gonna let us in, right? I bet the committee members are super busy today too.」

Touko
「Right... Oh, I wanna go up on the roof. I'm sure they'll have bamboo decorations up this year too.」

％Ｂ
「It'd be great if we could look into the classrooms too. I wanna sit in my old seat.」

Touko
「Oh, I like that idea! Maybe I should've worn my old uniform for the occasion.」

％Ｂ
「...Uh. I dunno about that.」
Touko
「What? You don't think so? I think I could still pull it off. It'd be like going back to when I used to go here, just for today.」

No, I meant it'd totally be okay in front of just me.
But if she did that in public like this, and we happened to run into anyone we know... Just imagining it's terrifying.

％Ｂ
「I didn't mean that you couldn't pull it off... Besides, no one wore the same uniform as you back then either. You'd stick out like a sore thumb here.」


Touko
「It's fine, isn't it? I was cute. There are lots of other people wearing clothes that stick out more than that for the festival, aren't there?」


Well... that uniform has gotten a lot of use since we graduated high school.\n\r

In ways that one might expect.
Touko
「Mmm... I guess this is fine. I could've worn my yukata too, but a certain someone I know would strip it off me right away.」


％Ｂ
「Bfh!? D-Don't say stuff like that!」
Touko
「But it's the truuuth. You always do dirty stuff to me when I wear a yukata.」

Uh... I have nothing to say in response.
Yukata have gotten pretty up there in my ranking of clothing that gets me turned on, after Touko and I properly consummated our relationship while she was wearing one.

％Ｂ
「You can't blame me! You're cute when you're wearing your yukata! And you've been growing your hair out lately too... There's a lot to it for guys, all right!?」

Touko
「Ahahah! I knooow. I'm very glad it seems like my efforts are properly bearing fruit.」

％Ｂ
「Wha? Efforts? ...What are you talking about?」
Touko
「Girls always put in lots of effort in secret. Mr. Azuma told me a truly good woman never shows herself making that effort to her man, even when she lives with him.」


...What the heck has he been saying to her?
I've already told him so many times to stop putting weird ideas in Touko's head...

Shionagi First Academy's Tanabata Festival seriously hasn't changed at all.
I can remember the days when I was running around as a member of the event committee as if it were only yesterday.\n \n\r
The feelings and memories of those days are so vivid in my mind that I wouldn't be surprised if Shuuichi contacted me to tell me he had work for me to do.

％Ｂ
「We did a lot of stuff back then too. Though it looks like the displays are pretty much the same.」

Food-type stuff like yakisoba and takoyaki.
Amusement-type stuff like shooting galleries and haunted houses.\n\r
Most of the basic structure's pretty much unchanged, and the only differences are in the specifics.
Touko
「Mmm... Now that you mention it, the stargazing seminar and aquarium were pretty unique, weren't they? People were talking about them a lot.」

％Ｂ
「Haha, that's true. That takes me back.」
The memories of us working together with our friends on those displays.
I'm sure the current students are also experiencing those kinds of bonds and memories.

％Ｂ
「I remember we got teased by a lot of other people after that...」
Touko
「Oh yeah, I remember that. When I think back on it now, you were pretty much advertising our relationship to the entire school by doing that tanzaku thing.」


％Ｂ
「...I was desperate back then.」
Touko
「Ahahah! You were doing all that for me. It made me really happy. I'll never forget it.」

％Ｂ
「People kept on bringing it up all the way until graduation... I was really surprised when the newspaper club wrote an article on that bamboo display... And they made it seem real dramatic too.」


Touko
「Oh, that wasn't them dramatizing anything, you know. Natsuki and I were interviewed by the newspaper club. We gave them lots of photos too.」


％Ｂ
「Excuse me!? That's news to me!」
Touko
「Is it? Natsuki and I did lots of other stuff to mess with you after that, didn't we? Ahaha, that sure was fun.」


％Ｂ
「...My memories on the subject are a little more painful than yours.」
I probably would've been able to look back fondly on these memories if I hadn't pretty much always been the victim of their pranks.

Touko
「It's because you always fell for them just like we thought you would. You and Four-Eyes-kun never failed to disappoint when it came to being pranked.」


The Touko-Segawa team was famous throughout our school.
They caused trouble all throughout the school as the "Tag-Team Devils," and for some reason I also got dragged into being yelled at by the teacher with them.

Touko
「Natsuki told me about this, but apparently people still talk about our pranks from back then today. I guess I've gone and created a legend for myself.」


％Ｂ
「...Is that something to be happy about?」
Though that did help Touko interact with lots of different people.\n \n\r
We can recall memory after precious memory as we walk around the school together... There's no end to the reminiscing between us.

Touko
「Hey, let's go to the roof! There shouldn't be that many people there yet, right?」

％Ｂ
「Yeah. Let's go while it isn't too crowded.」
I haven't seen this scenery in a long time.
It feels a bit lonesome here without the astronomical telescope.
Touko
「Oh, yep, there it is. There are lots of tanzaku again this year.」
all
The rooftop's quiet. It's separated from the din of the festival.
A warm, nostalgic feeling wells up in me when I see the bamboo with students' wishes sway in the wind.

Touko
「Tadaaa! Ehehe, I got some tanzaku earlier!」
％Ｂ
「Huh. When'd you grab those?」
Touko
「Let's write some wishes. We're at a Tanabata Festival, so let's do what we can, right?」

％Ｂ
「Haha, especially since we've both got some important exams coming up. I bet this'll help us do well for sure.」

all
I take a tanzaku from Touko.
I'm sure we're both wishing for the same thing this year.
％Ｂ
「...Okay, done. You ready?」
Touko
「Mhm. Oh, mine's kinda more desperate. I have to rely more on this than you do, because I haven't been working for it as long.」

My tanzaku says, "I wish to pass my exam."
Touko's has a forceful "Exam pass!!!"
Now that I'm comparing the two, hers really does seem a lot more desperate.
％Ｂ
「I think it's fine. Anyway, I'll just tie these onto the bamboo... There we go.」

Touko
「Counting on yooou! Okay, now I'll pass for sure!」

％Ｂ
「You better not start slacking off on studying 'cause of this. You need to keep doing your due diligence starting tomorrow and...」

Touko
「Geez, we can talk about that tomorrow! Today's for having fun! We're going to walk around and eat now!」

％Ｂ
「Whoa!? Hey, don't pull!」
Touko
「Ahh... I'm full. This school's got some really high-level displays. That food was pretty good.」

％Ｂ
「Urpfh...gh... I ate a bit too much...!」
I've been eating a ton of different stuff all day today.
And I'm beyond stuffed now, after Touko started getting carried away with throwing random food in my mouth...

Touko
「Mmm... Those last few takoyaki might've been too much.」
％Ｂ
「You freakin' threw all of them in my mouth... Urpfh... You looked like you were having the time of your life...! Gepfh... I told you I couldn't...!」


And then some students started joining in and threw their food in my mouth too...!\n \n\r
She started getting carried away and stuck right against me and did the "Ahhh" thing to me, which only made the students (mostly girls) squeal and scream along.

Touko
「Oh, look over there! They're doing a paper airplane contest! Wow... That looks fun!」

％Ｂ
「Whoa, now that takes me back! I don't even remember the last time I made a paper airplane.」

Touko
「There's also... a Miss Shionagi contest, a crossdressing contest... Ahaha, it really feels like a place for students to have fun.」

％Ｂ
「I remember we did stuff like that back then too. Things like this never change, I guess.」

Touko
「Mhm, seems like it. There are kids taking lots of photos like Natsuki did too... I'm sure it'll always be this way.」


She squeezes my arm.
I smile at Touko and pull her nice and close.
Touko
「Hey, wanna enter the paper airplane contest? It says there's a fabulous prize for the winner!」

％Ｂ
「All right, let's do it to work off all this food! I dunno if I'll win, but I'm not gonna lose to you, all right?」

Touko
「Mmhehe... I'm going to be aiming for the win. Our motivation levels are different. Maybe the two of us should compete?」

％Ｂ
「You're on. Penalty for the loser?」
Touko
「Mmm... What should it be? Oh, how about you have to enter the crossdressing contest? I don't think the timing would overlap with the paper airplane contest.」


％Ｂ
「Excuse me!? Th-That's not okay! They'll be taking photos!」

Touko
「Why don't you just beat me, then? Don't worry, I'll handle your makeup. I'll make you look really cute.」

％Ｂ
「That's not the issue! Then I'm gonna make you enter the Miss Shionagi contest!」

Touko
「Fine, I'm not going to lose anyway. I used to be pretty into making paper airplanes for a while. I'm going to make an amazing one and shock you.」


all
Time flies when you're having fun.
We're on our way home from Shionagi Academy.
Touko
「Mmm...! That was sooo much fun! We did so much stuff...!」

We smile in satisfaction at each other.
It was more tiring than I thought to walk around all day, since I've been studying at home pretty much every day lately...

％Ｂ
「Yeah... It's been a while since I had that much fun.」
But I enjoyed myself a lot.
I'm physically tired, but there's also a comfortable sense of fulfillment. I feel mentally refreshed.

Touko
「I'm glad we went. I got to feel so nostalgic since nothing's changed... I was so happy.」


％Ｂ
「I dunno why, but it's just kinda comforting. It's the school we used to go to every day back then.」

Touko
「There were times when I didn't want things to change... but now I'm looking forward to the two of us moving forward together like this.」

％Ｂ
「Huh?」
Touko
「Don't you think so too? We wouldn't be able to feel nostalgic about things if we didn't change. We wouldn't be able to look forward to tomorrow either.」


If something never ended or changed, then you could never enjoy reminiscing on it later on.
Looking back on things that have ended can also let you get excited for the future.
I'm genuinely so happy that Touko thinks of things that way now, when she used to be so afraid of change before.

％Ｂ
「...You're right. Then we'll have to look toward the future and work hard on studying again starting tomorrow.」

Touko
「Geez, why do you always have to be so realistic...? I said something really great just now. This is the part where you're supposed to get emotional and cry!」


You can't comment on how good your own words were...
I can't stop myself from laughing at how she's puffed up and sulking.
Touko
「Oh, you laughed! You're acting all serious, but maybe you're the one who hasn't had enough fun
, Ryousuke

!」
％Ｂ
「Haha, my bad. But you said so yourself, right? If you're gonna look forward to tomorrow, then you gotta do your best and overcome the stuff that you don't like.」


Touko
「...Okaaay. But we're off today, and the Tanabata Festival only ends once we're home. So... we can enjoy ourselves just a bit more, right?」


％Ｂ
「Huh?」
Touko
「Let's take a detour! The main street's really exciting with Shionagi's Tanabata Festival right now, right?」

all
％Ｂ
「Agh!? Wha, you seriously wanna do more!?」
Our fun day's going to continue for just a bit longer.
We'll turn today's fun into memories, and into motivation for tomorrow.
Let's do our best again starting tomorrow, for the sake of having happy dreams for our future.
