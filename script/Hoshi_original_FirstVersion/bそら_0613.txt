Classes are over.
Ousaka and I are supposed to go to the faculty office to request to extend the astronomy club's hours before going to the rooftop today.

％Ｂ
「I'm off, then.」
Rikka
「Oh, wait. I have a message for you from Nirasawa-kun. He said to come to the committee office after school today.」

％Ｂ
「The committee office? I wonder why.」
Rikka
「I don't know. It's just what I was asked to tell you. Anyway, I've told you now.」

％Ｂ
「Aren't you guys coming with?」
Rikka
「Segawa-san and I were assigned to support the naturalist club with Shinozaki-san. We'll be going to the naturalist clubroom for a while.」


％Ｂ
「Oh, okay. You're really working hard.」
Rikka
「I really am... How did things turn out this way...?」
％Ｂ
「A-Anyway, keep up the good work. I'm gonna go to the committee office, then.」

I wonder what Shuuichi wants to talk about.
％Ｂ
「Shuuichi, you here?」
Shuuichi
「You're here. Sorry about making you come here.」
％Ｂ
「No, I don't really mind... What'd you wanna talk about?」
Shuuichi
「Yeah, it's about the naturalist club. They've figured out what the club want to do, so I thought you ought to know.」

％Ｂ
「Huh? Really? That was faster than I expected.」
Shuuichi
「Yeah, they had an idea after some small, unrelated chat, but it turned out to be a more interesting idea than we expected after a bit of polishing.」

％Ｂ
「So it's one of those ideas that really only came about through discussing it with everyone.」
Shuuichi
「That's right. And I'm guessing the astronomy club's still going to take some more time, judging by the relief on your face.」


％Ｂ
「...I don't remember you being this sharp...」
Shuuichi
「I've been watching people a lot ever since I took on the role of committee chair.」
％Ｂ
「...I... need you to wait just a little longer for the astronomy club.」
Shuuichi
「I'll wait until the last possible moment. Or more like I feel like you're gonna pull it off at the last possible moment.」


％Ｂ
「I'd love to meet those expectations... So what's the naturalist club planning on doing?」

Shuuichi
「We definitely couldn't go with Okihara-senpai's idea of a large-scale aquarium using the entire school, but we decided we could probably manage with a small one.」


％Ｂ
「So it's a mini aquarium. That sounds cool.」
Shuuichi
「She's already started preparing. I've got Shinozaki and the others supporting her, and they're apparently going to go catch the fish she wants to display in the aquarium tomorrow.」


％Ｂ
「Already?」
Shuuichi
「Okihara-senpai says she wants to have them ready early on, to make sure the water tank conditions are stable, and to get the fish acclimated. I got a detailed explanation about it from her, but it was way over my head.」


％Ｂ
「Ah... Yeah, I can imagine.」
I never really understand explanations from people who study something really specific, like Senpai and Ousaka.

Shuuichi
「So. They apparently need a guy to help capture and carry the fish back. You go.」


％Ｂ
「Wha? Why me?」
Shuuichi
「You're the only one who's free. And you agreed to still do event committee work in addition to the astronomy club stuff, right?」


％Ｂ
「Yeah, I did...」
Shuuichi
「Everyone who's working with the naturalist club right now's a girl. Go with them and show them your manly side.」

％Ｂ
「Easy for you to say... But whatever, I'll go.」
I can't not help out if that's how things are.
Shuuichi
「You can ask Shinozaki and the others for details.」
％Ｂ
「Got it. So that's all? I'm gonna go to the astronomy club, then.」

I find Ousaka waiting for me in front of the door.

％Ｂ
「I'm late. My bad. I had to stop by the event committee office for a bit.」

Sora
「...No issues.」
％Ｂ
「Uhh... Is there anything we need to bring with us?」
Sora
「...The request form. I've filled it out already. We turn this in to the extracurricular adviser and get permission from him.」

％Ｂ
「Okay. You know a lot about this.」
Sora
「...Because I'm president.」
She looks just a little bit smug.
She's so interesting...
％Ｂ
「Right, let's go.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
all
％Ｂ
「Excuse meee.」
Sora
「...Excuse me.」
We arrive at the faculty office.
％Ｂ
「Let's see... Who's the extracurricular adviser?」
Sora
「...Yamashita-sensei.」
％Ｂ
「Yamashita... Excuse me, is Yamashita-sensei here?」

all
An elderly teacher with white hair stands up near the back of the room in response.

％Ｂ
「...By the way. Is he strict?」
I ask Ousaka in a low voice.
Sora
「...*nod* It was hard getting permission to use the roof from him.」
％Ｂ
「You're kidding...」
Sora
「...But he's not a bad person.」
％Ｂ
「Really... Well, it's not like we're trying to do anything bad. Let's be confident.」


all
Yamashita-sensei
「An extension request for club activities. Which club would this be for?」
Sora
「...Astronomy club.」
Yamashita-sensei
「The astronomy club... Hm, until 8 p.m...」
Yamashita-sensei seems to be thinking something over.
Yamashita-sensei
「Unfortunately, I cannot grant you permission for this.」
Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「Wha? Excuse me, but... why?」
Yamashita-sensei
「Club activity extensions are limited to 7 p.m. at this time of year, as it gets dark out any later than that.」

％Ｂ
「Well, but... if anything, we'd like to stay until then because we need it to be dark out.」

Sora
「...It's still a little light out at 7 p.m. this time of year.」
Yamashita-sensei
「What would the specific reason for this extension be?」
Sora
「...Because 
Ryou 
this person  
wants to see the stars.」
％Ｂ
「It-It's stargazing! Stargazing! It's the most legitimate activity there is for an astronomy club!」

That was close! Just saying it's because I wanna see stars isn't gonna get us permission!

Yamashita-sensei
「I see. Yes, the stars would certainly be more visible when it is dark out.」

Sora
「...*nod* That's why we want to stay until eight...」
Yamashita-sensei
「Unfortunately, I still cannot bend the rules for you.」
Sora
「...No matter what?」
Yamashita-sensei
「No matter what. As I said before, the latest one can stay for club activities at this time of year is 7 p.m. We cannot permit anything later than that.」


Sora
「...」
Ousaka frowns at me.
Yamashita-sensei
「You've already been doing your club activities at the same time as the other clubs until now, haven't you?」

Sora
「...*nod*」
Sora
「...There are stars we can see even when it's light out. But we could see more at night.」

Yamashita-sensei
「I would imagine so. However, I cannot give permission.」
Sora
「...」
all
％Ｂ
「Please wait.」
Yamashita-sensei
「What is it?」
％Ｂ
「I think that the whole point of the astronomy club's activities would be to observe the stars. And I believe it should go without question that those kinds of activities would primarily be done at night.」


％Ｂ
「Wouldn't you say that the astronomy club exists here at this school because the school has acknowledged that the club would undertake those kinds of activities?」

Yamashita-sensei
「Hm.」
％Ｂ
「I think club activities are important because they allow students to independently improve and expand their skills outside of the classroom. I may be out of line in saying this, but please acknowledge that independence.」


Yamashita-sensei
「...Your argument is sound.」
％Ｂ
「Then―」
Yamashita-sensei
「But the school has a duty to protect its students.」
％Ｂ
「...Protect...?」
Yamashita-sensei
「As far as I know, the astronomy club is currently only comprised of one girl. We cannot permit a single girl to stay here alone late at night, from a safety standpoint. Surely you understand that.」


％Ｂ
「Well yes, but... but I'll be here too! That should be fine then, right?」

Sora
「...」
Yamashita-sensei
「You are not a member of the astronomy club. If we allow students with no relation to the club to stay behind, then it's possible that we may get other students loitering here too.」


％Ｂ
「But I'm―」
Shuuichi
「What are you making such a scene here for?」
％Ｂ
「Oh, Shuuichi... Why are you...?」
Shuuichi
「I'm here to report to Yamashita-sensei about the results of one of the meetings for the Tanabata Festival. Oh, Sensei, this guy's one of our committee members. He's been assigned to support the astronomy club.」


Yamashita-sensei
「You're also in the event committee?」
％Ｂ
「Y-Yes... 
I'm Hino Ryousuke, in class 2-C
I am
.」
Shuuichi
「As for the astronomy club extending its hours, it's relevant to its display for the Tanabata Festival, so I asked him to go alone. Could you grant permission? The committee can also share the burden of responsibility.」


Yamashita-sensei
「Hm... He's a transfer student, isn't he? Can we really depend on him for all this?」

Shuuichi
「I've known him for a long time. He's trustworthy.」
Yamashita-sensei
「I see. Well, if you say so, then we'll allow it.」

all
Yamashita-sensei smiles cheerily and stamps his permission on the request form.\n\r

Now we're officially allowed to stay at school until 8 p.m.
Shuuichi
「What do you think? They trust me a lot, don't they?」
％Ｂ
「...Honestly, that was surprisingly impressive.」
Shuuichi
「Being serious and diligent all the time comes in pretty handy in times like these.」
％Ｂ
「You're pretty good at what you do.」
Sora
「...」
Shuuichi
「Hm? What's wrong, Astronomy Club President?」
Sora
「...Thanks, Shuu.」
Shuuichi
「Shuu? Is that me? Either way, you don't need to thank me too much. 

Ryousuke 
This guy 
pretty much already convinced Yamashita-sensei on his own. He just needed that one last push.」

Shuuichi
「Anyway, back to work for me. I'll let you handle the rest

, Ryousuke

.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. Thanks.」
all
Ousaka and I watch Shuuichi walk away.
％Ｂ
「Phew... It's great we managed to get that permission. Now we can stay here until 8 p.m. without worrying.」

Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「Hm? What's wrong?」
Sora
「...Thanks.」
％Ｂ
「S-Sure thing... Well, to be fair, this is all just 'cause I said I wanted to see the stars at night anyway.」

Sora
「...」
She's staring at my face.
Her doing this is making my heart rate increase again...
％Ｂ
「A-Anyway, let's take the telescope up to the roof! Yeah?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
We set up the telescope in the usual spot.
Sora
「...」
Ousaka hasn't said anything in particular, but she just seems happy.

％Ｂ
「So now all that's left is to wait until night.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「By the way, is this gonna be your first time stargazing up here at night?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
Sora
「...That's why I'm really grateful to you
, Ryou

.」
％Ｂ
「Oh really. That makes me happy too, then.」
Sora
「...*nod*...」
I smile at her, and she goes red a little and gives a tiny nod.
Oh. That was kinda cute...
all
It's gotten pretty dark out.
I'm sitting against the wall, watching Ousaka as she peers through the telescope.

I can just tell she's a lot happier than she is when she's looking through it when it's bright out.

％Ｂ
「...」
I feel like she doesn't show her emotions much usually, but it's always so easy to tell when she's happy from the way her eyes shine.

She might be really honest about showing how she feels in some ways.
Sora
「...
Ryou
Mm
.」
％Ｂ
「...」
Sora
「...
Ryou
Mmh
...!」
％Ｂ
「Hm... Wha?」
Sora
「...Hm.」
She's quirking her index finger at the eyepiece.
It's the usual signal for me to look through.
％Ｂ
「R-Right.」
all
I walk up and look through the eyepiece.
％Ｂ
「Ooohh... Oohhhh...!?」
I can see a beautiful, dazzlingly bright moon suspended in darkness.
％Ｂ
「This is amazing! The moon's amazing when it's shining!」
I'm honestly just so excited.
％Ｂ
「It was amazing during the day, but this is way more amazing! I dunno what to say... It's amazing!」

My heart's been stolen away by the shining, golden moon.
I'm so excited that my feedback sounds like something a kid would say.
％Ｂ
「I've never seen anything like it!」
I pull away from the telescope and look at Ousaka.
Sora
「...Mhmh.」
She smiles smugly and gives me a thumbs-up.
％Ｂ
「Oh man... This is actually getting me emotional... I think I get why you're so into this stuff now.」

Sora
「...All thanks to you
, Ryou

.」
％Ｂ
「Hm?」
Sora
「...We can see this because you negotiated for us to stay


.」
％Ｂ
「Oh... but it's not like I did anything much, really. And besides, it's more thanks to Shuuichi.」

Sora
「...No, it's thanks to you
, Ryou

. You were so cool back then.」




％Ｂ
「W-Was I?」
That really makes me blush...
％Ｂ
「W-Well anyway, if there's any stars you wanna see, now's your chance. Since we'll have to go home in an hour.」


Sora
「...If there's any stars you want to see, 
Ryou, 

I want to know.」
％Ｂ
「No, the moon was enough for me just now, so you should look at what you wanna look at.」
Sora
「...It's okay. Let's look at the stars you want to see.


」
％Ｂ
「You sure? Then... I know, which one's the North Star?」
Sora
「...North Star.」
She starts adjusting the telescope's angle.
Sora
「...To find the North Star, take the distance between Dubhe and Merak in the Big Dipper and extend it five times to the north.」

Right, she sent me the same thing over LIME yesterday.
Sora
「...Mm.」
She points at the eyepiece.
all
％Ｂ
「Let's see... Ohoh... So this is the North Star.」
There's a star glimmering in the telescope's field of view, far smaller than the moon.
Sora
「The North Star refers to the star closest to the sky's north pole. That star is currently Polaris in Ursa Minor.」

％Ｂ
「...Currently? What do you mean, currently?」
Sora
「...The North Pole moves a little every year. To be precise, it looks like it's moving because of Earth's precession. So a different star becomes the North Star every several thousand years.」


Sora
「...Vega in Lyra used to be the North Star in the past.」
％Ｂ
「You mean the one in the Summer Triangle? That's Orihime, right?」
Sora
「...Right. Vega was the North Star circa 11,000 BC. In the future, Deneb in Cygnus, also part of the Summer Triangle, will become the North Star. After that, it'll be Vega again.」


％Ｂ
「Huh... Really. I never knew the North Star changed...」

Sora
「...It's no issue to us because it'll be Polaris until we die.」
％Ｂ
「Well yeah... Oh, then show me where the Summer Triangle is too.」

Sora
「...*nod*」
She looks up at the sky without using the telescope this time.
Sora
「...It's this way.」
I look up at the portion of the sky she's pointing to.
Sora
「...First find a big, bright star. Look where I'm pointing.」
％Ｂ
「Where you're pointing...」
Sora
「...Get closer.」
％Ｂ
「S-Sure...」
I walk up to Ousaka and look down the length of her arm.
...Uh, this is really close, though.
I'm starting to get nervous again...
all
Sora
「...Can you see?」
％Ｂ
「Hmm... Oh, found it! I see a big one!」
Sora
「...That's Vega. The brightest star in Lyra. It's one of summer's exemplary stars, and you can see it clearly with the naked eye. It's Orihime from the legend of Tanabata.」


％Ｂ
「Okay, so there's Orihime. Where's Hikoboshi?」
Sora
「...Look down to the southeast from Vega to find another bright star.」

I follow the movement of Ousaka's finger with my gaze.
％Ｂ
「...Is that it? I can see a big star.」
Sora
「...That's Altair. The brightest star in Aquila. Another first-magnitude star that's visible with the naked eye. Hikoboshi from the legend of Tanabata.」

％Ｂ
「So the Milky Way's between them?」
Sora
「...*nod* And to the left of Vega and Altair―」
％Ｂ
「Oh, w-wait a second...」
Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「My neck hurts from looking up this whole time...」
I look down for a moment to massage the base of my neck.
％Ｂ
「Sorry to interrupt. I'm just not used to looking up at the sky like this.」

Sora
「...」
all
Ousaka suddenly circles behind me as I'm rubbing my neck.
She places her hands on my shoulders.
％Ｂ
「Hm...?」
I thought she might rub my shoulders for me, but she starts tugging me downward.

％Ｂ
「H-Hey? Ousaka?」
Sora
「...Sit.」
％Ｂ
「Wha... S-Sure...」
I sit down on the ground like she says.
And then she starts pulling me backward.
％Ｂ
「Wha...!?」
％Ｂ
「...Huh?」
The back of my head makes contact with something soft and kinda warm, instead of the hard concrete of the rooftop.\n\r

It's...?
％Ｂ
「Uhh...」
It's Ousaka's thighs.
Ousaka's giving me a lap pillow...!
Sora
「...You won't get tired this way.」
％Ｂ
「Ye...Yeah, that's true...」
Ousaka looks down on me from above.
I can feel the lingering warmth from a day's worth of sunlight in the concrete against my back.\n\r
And the warm, soft sensation of Ousaka's thighs against the back of my head.
Is this really okay?
She's right that lying down like this will let me look up at the stars without hurting my neck, but...

％Ｂ
「...You sure?」
Sora
「...?」
She tilts her head at my question.
I stare at Ousaka's face, my heart racing.
The night sky extends out forever behind her. 
Multitudes of stars glimmer in the darkness. 
And there's another pretty light, just as pretty as the stars, right in front of me─
In Ousaka's eyes.
Sora
「...Continuing.」
She looks up at the sky.
Sora
「...Directly left of Vega and Altair. There's another bright star. Can you see it?」

％Ｂ
「Uh... R-Right... Just a second.」
Now's not the time to be staring at Ousaka's face.
Let's see, that's Vega there, and there's Altair...
And if you go straight left...
％Ｂ
「Yeah... I see it.」
Sora
「...Cygnus's Deneb. Those three are the Summer Triangle.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, I see it... The Summer Triangle's bigger than I thought.」
Sora
「...It's hard to find if you think of it as a constellation. It's a big triangle formed of three stars, all from different constellations.」

％Ｂ
「Vega in Lyra, Altair in Aquila, Deneb in Cygnus. All right, I'll remember those.」

Sora
「...One day, Zeus fell in love with the queen of Sparta, Leda.」
％Ｂ
「Hm?」
Sora
「Zeus changed his form in order to approach her. That's Cygnus, the swan.」

％Ｂ
「Huh, really. So there's a reason behind them and everything. What about Aquila?」

Sora
「...Zeus changed his form in order to abduct the beautiful prince of Troy, Ganymedes. That's Aquila, the eagle.」

％Ｂ
「...Zeus was crazy...」
Man or woman, didn't matter to him...
I remember he went for Callisto in the Ursa Major story too. Maybe he should learn some self-restraint...?

％Ｂ
「Is there a story behind Lyra?」
Sora
「...The lyre was owned by Orpheus, who was the son of Apollo, who was the son of Zeus. Once upon a time―」

I feel really comfortable listening to Ousaka talk.
There's the warmth against my back and head, and the way her voice tickles my ears is nice too.

I close my eyes without even realizing, and my consciousness gradually fades...
％Ｂ
「...Zzz... Zzz...」
％Ｂ
「...Nh... ahh...」
Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「Whoa...!?」
I open my eyes, and I freak out when I see Ousaka's face right there in front of me.
％Ｂ
「Wh-What? Did I fall asleep?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「S-Sorry! Your lap was really comfortable, so I just...」
Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「Oh, uh... I mean, well...」
％Ｂ
「...Wait. What time is it?」
I frantically pull my phone out to check the time.
％Ｂ
「7:50! Crap! We need to start getting ready to go home!」
I reluctantly pull myself off of Ousaka's lap.
％Ｂ
「Come on, Ousaka.」
I hold out my hand to her to help her stand up.
But Ousaka just stares at my hand without moving.
％Ｂ
「What's wrong?」
Sora
「...The mobility of my lower legs has decreased dramatically due to prolonged blockage of blood flow.」
％Ｂ
「...So your legs are numb.」
Sora
「...Mm.」
She's giving me a thumbs-up for some reason...
all
I'm waiting with Ousaka for the bus to come.
％Ｂ
「Your legs okay now?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
It seemed like her legs weren't going to recover for a while, so I put away the telescope and stored it in the clubroom.

％Ｂ
「Sorry. It's my fault.」
Sora
「...*shake shake*」
％Ｂ
「And sorry for falling asleep while you were talking about the stars too.」
Sora
「...*shake shake*」
％Ｂ
「Let's put in a request to stay late again soon. Then you can tell me about the stars again.」
Sora
「...*nod* Summer's only just beginning. We have lots of time.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah. It's a promise, then.」
Sora
「...It's a promise.」
all
The bus isn't here yet.
I don't really know why, but I want to be with Ousaka like this for a little longer.

％Ｂ
「...Speaking of which, you got any plans tomorrow?」
Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「The naturalist club's apparently decided on what to do. It's gonna be a mini aquarium.」

％Ｂ
「So I'm going with everyone tomorrow to help catch the fish for the aquarium. If you're free, you wanna come with?」


Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「It's going to be Okihara-senpai, Shinozaki, Segawa, and probably Narusawa.」

％Ｂ
「It's most of the people we went camping with before, so I think they'd love it if you came too. What do you think?」

Sora
「...I don't have any plans tomorrow.」
％Ｂ
「Then...?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「All right! Yeah, that's great! Oh, that's actually perfect, 'cause I need to ask Shinozaki when we're meeting up and stuff anyway. I'll tell her you're coming too.」


Sora
「...*nod*」
all
I pull out my phone and send Shinozaki a LIME message.

I'm glad Ousaka's coming with.
I'll get to be with her tomorrow too this way.
...Wait, why am I this excited anyway?
My heart's been beating away this whole time...
...I wonder if it's because of that lap pillow...
