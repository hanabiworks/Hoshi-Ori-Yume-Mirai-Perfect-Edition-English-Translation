I've come to Azuma-san's firm first thing in the morning with my new rough draft in hand.

Azuma
「...」
％Ｂ
「...」
Azuma-san stares at the draft intently.
He's been rejecting every single one up until now after just a glance, but not this time.

Azuma
「...Hmph.」
％Ｂ
「...Gulp...」
How'd I do...!?
Azuma
「So you finally figured it out.」
He places the draft on his desk and looks at me.
Azuma
「What I wanted is something like this. Your design. Hino Ryousuke's unique touch.」

Azuma
「What I wanted is something like this. Your design. Your unique touch.」

％Ｂ
「Teacher...」
Azuma
「You've been trying to give me designs that were inspired by my work, because it's work you got from my firm. Though I don't know if it was anything you were doing consciously.」


Azuma
「That'd be fine if we were doing it just under my name. But this job's got the names of both of our firms on it.」


Azuma
「And we're proclaiming that the Hino Architectural Firm's the one doing the design.」
Azuma
「And we're proclaiming that your architectural firm's the one doing the design.」
Azuma
「There's no need to stifle your own design to match mine. There's no point to two firms collaborating in that case.」

％Ｂ
「Yes... I think it's as you say. When I looked back over the rough drafts you had rejected, I realized that they were almost all copying Azuma Morio.」


％Ｂ
「When you said that this was collaborative, but also distributed, you were saying I need to add more of my own touch... That I needed to draw up a draft with my own aesthetics.」


％Ｂ
「I'm very sorry it took me this long to realize.」
Azuma
「Well, it's still good that you did. I'd expect nothing less of a disciple of mine.」

％Ｂ
「Teacher...」
Azuma
「But, rejected.」
％Ｂ
「Wha... Excuse meeee!?」
Azuma
「You really thought you'd get okayed on the first try? There's no way there's just this one design inside you. Next time, bring me drafts even better than this one, and enough to make me not know which one I wanna pick. Got it?」


％Ｂ
「Kh... Yes, I get it. I'll do it! I'll bring designs that are so good they'll keep you up at night!」

We bring our opinions to bear with everything we have in order to create a single thing.
That's how you bring about something truly good.
I realize once again.
I'm so glad I have Azuma Morio as a mentor.
