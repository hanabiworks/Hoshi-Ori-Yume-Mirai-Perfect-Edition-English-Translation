And the next day―
Is Shionagi City's Tanabata Festival.
Marika and I have already promised to go together.
She's apparently going to come wearing a yukata.
My heart's thumping while I wait for her to arrive...
％Ｂ
「Comiiiing!」
％Ｂ
「Whoa...!?」
I open the door to see Marika there in her yukata. I lose the ability to speak when I see her like this for the first time...

Marika
「Hellooo～」
％Ｂ
「Wait... What?」
...She's not wearing a yukata?
Marika
「Wh-What!? Did I get it wrong? Umm, um, we're supposed to go to the festival together today... right?」


％Ｂ
「Y-Yeah! We did! Of course we did! No doubt about that!」

Marika
「Thank god～ ...I thought I made a mistake. I was about to die from disappointment...」

％Ｂ
「No, that'd be overreacting...」
Marika
「But why'd you look so confused?」
％Ｂ
「Well, it's just that you said you'd wear a yukata.」
Marika
「Oh, yeah, I'll wear it. I will wear one!」
Marika
「But, umm～ ...My mom already went to the festival... and it's hard to put it on by myself...」

％Ｂ
「Oh, I get it. Right, 'cause you have to have someone help you.」
Marika
「Yeah, and when I told my mom that, umm... She was like, "Why don't you have Ryousuke-kun help you?"...」

Marika
「Yeah, and when I told my mom that, umm... She just told me to have you help me...」

％Ｂ
「Huh? Me?」
Marika
「Yeah, maybe not...? Oh, it's fine if you don't want to, of course...」

She's holding a paper bag.
I bet her yukata's inside.
I've never helped anyone put one on before, but...
％Ｂ
「There's no way I wouldn't wanna. I wanna see you in a yukata more than anyone. I'd be glad to help.」


Marika
「Oh, th-then... Please do!」
％Ｂ
「Leave it to me!」
％Ｂ
「What on earth...」
I've got my head in my hands, trying to read up on how to tie off an obi on the internet.
This is so complicated...
And is this really going to end up shaped like that?
％Ｂ
「I should probably watch some videos too...」
Marika
「U-Umm～ ...Please hold this sleeve～」
％Ｂ
「Oh yeah, my bad... Wait.」
Marika
「A-Auhh～」
％Ｂ
「U-Uhh...」
Marika fidgets a bit bashfully.
She's got panties on and cotton wrappings around her breasts.
I freeze.
％Ｂ
「Y-You should've told me you were gonna strip.」
Marika
「S-Sorry. I didn't want to interrupt you while you were focusing～」

％Ｂ
「Oh, well, I'm grateful for that... but I dunno where I should be looking. I'll try not to look too much.」


Marika
「Thank you for your consideration～」
％Ｂ
「Uhh, this fine?」
Marika
「It-It is～ Umm, take this and do that...」

％Ｂ
「...What are those for?」
She's neatly folding up a few towels.
Marika
「Oh, umm, you put towels inside the yukata to make your body look smoother. It's prettier this way.」


％Ｂ
「Huh, really.」
I see, so it's to get rid of the curves around the chest and waist.
I guess they do say a straight figure fits yukata better.
Though that seems like a bit of a waste to me.
Marika
「Umm, put this here... Huh? It's not working...」

Marika
「Wawah, it'll slide down like this...」
Marika seems really unfamiliar with this.
％Ｂ
「You gotta do it tighter. And that's not how you tie it...」

Marika
「Whaaat? Like this?」
％Ｂ
「No, I think it's the other way around. Here, give it here. Take this... and pull.」

Marika
「W-Wawah!? I-I think you might... be rubbing me～」
％Ｂ
「Sorry, but you'll just have to bear it. This kinda stuff's all about the preparation.」

Marika
「W-Wawawawawawawah!?」
％Ｂ
「Here, suck in your belly a bit. I'm gonna pull this tight.」

all
Marika
「O-Ohhh～ nooo～」
％Ｂ
「Whoa, there's a ton of people～」
Marika
「Yeah. It's the biggest festival in Shionagi City.」
We've come out to the city after managing to get her yukata on.
The streets are filled with groups of friends, families, and couples.

％Ｂ
「So pretty.」
Marika
「Isn't it～ Bamboo decorations, streamers, and paper lanterns! I'm so glad I live here in Shionagi!」

％Ｂ
「Uhh, no, not that...」
She's right that the Tanabata Festival decorations are really pretty.
But that's not what's been catching my eye this whole time.
The prettiest thing here is...
％Ｂ
「...I was just admiring how pretty you are in that yukata.」
Marika
「W-Waaah～」
Marika blushes a deep red after I muster the courage to say it.

Marika
「I'm so glad I live here in Shionagi～」
％Ｂ
「What the heck?」
Marika
「Because... that's how I met you, Ryousuke-kun...」
Marika
「Because... that's how I met you...」
She looks up at me.
Her flushed cheeks are illuminated by the streetlamps.
Her smile's like a flower.
Marika
「Kyah...!」
We can't help but bump into people.
％Ｂ
「Watch out. You okay?」
Marika
「Y-Yeah... There's so many people here...」
％Ｂ
「We gotta make sure we don't get separated... C'mon.」

Marika
「...Okay♪」
Marika brings herself closer.
She happily links her arm with mine.
Marika
「I'll be squeezing tight～」
％Ｂ
「All right, let's go see everything!」
Marika
「Yes! Then let's go there first!」
The two of us go walk around the stalls. There's a dizzying amount of things to look at.
Marika's excited like a child, looking around all over at the sights.

Marika
「Oh, I want cotton candy～」
％Ｂ
「Oh, that sounds good. But didn't you say you ate dinner already?」

Marika
「Yeah, I did. But cotton candy's cotton, so it's okay.」

％Ｂ
「What kinda logic is that?」
Marika
「It is fine because it has no substance.」
％Ｂ
「So you're saying it's like mist...」
I can't stop myself at smiling at her childlike logic.
We stop at the cotton candy stall to get a small bag of candy.
％Ｂ
「Looks like you get to pick a bag. How about "Happiness Moon"? ...I guess that's a bit too kiddy.」

Marika
「I want "Smileman."」
％Ｂ
「Hmm... I... don't think I see "Smileman."」
It is a pretty old anime, so I'm not surprised.
It's all new stuff lining the stall.
Marika
「Whaaat～? ...But it's a masterpiece. Okay, then I'll pick "Rabbit Mochi."」

％Ｂ
「Sounds good. Um, excuse me!」

Marika
「Ehehehe... It's so good～」
She's tearing off little pieces of the cotton candy to put in her mouth.
％Ｂ
「You know you can just chomp away at it, right?」
Marika
「It's better to eat it bit by bit.」
％Ｂ
「Well, if you say so.」
Marika
「Oh, do you want some?」
She holds out a bit before me.
％Ｂ
「'Course! Hamh, hamh...」
Marika
「Kyah! You licked my finger～」
％Ｂ
「You're sweet all the way to your fingertips, Marika.」
Marika
「G-Geez～」
She seems embarrassed, but she giggles.
I want to spend time with her like this forever.
Marika
「...This makes me happy.」
She speaks quietly.
Marika
「It's always been my dream to go to the Tanabata Festival with you like this.」
％Ｂ
「Always?」
Marika
「I wanted to come here with you back when I was small too. But I was told that being in a crowd like this wouldn't be good for my body, so I could never go.」


％Ｂ
「...Yeah. You definitely couldn't have come here before.」

Marika
「Yeah, but... now it's easy-peasy. That's why I'm so happy today. I get to have fun like this.」


％Ｂ
「I'm happy too. We'll have to have tons of fun, then. Wanna get some candy apples?」


Marika
「Yes, I would～! ...Wait, this just makes it look like all of the things I think are fun involve eating...」


％Ｂ
「Look, they're selling them over there.」
Marika
「Oh, candy apples～♪」
She runs over to the stall.
Marika
「They all look so good～」
％Ｂ
「You can get anything you want. How about that really big one?」
Marika
「Huh? But I might not be able to finish it... Maybe I'll get the princess candy apple. The strawberry ones look good too～ I might not be able to decide with all these choices...」


％Ｂ
「Take your time, think it over. Look, there's grape ones too.」
Marika
「So many choices～」
She's clearly having trouble choosing with the variety of options before her.
It's cute just watching her.
Still, these stalls sure have lots of types nowadays.
Things are completely different from back when I was a kid.
The only stall that looks the same as back then's the mask shop on the other side of the street.
There's a few nostalgic character masks for sale, mixed in with the new ones.

％Ｂ
「...Huh?」
One of them catches my eye.
Marika
「I'm going to go with the princess apple after all! I wanted candy apples, so it has to be apples! Wait... What's the matter?」


％Ｂ
「Marika... Look over there. Is that mask...?」

Marika
「A-Aahhh...!?」
A perfectly round shape.
A beaming smile. It's...
Marika
「It's "Smileman"!!」
Marika
「It's so cute～♪」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. It looks good on you.」
Marika's smiling radiantly, wearing the Smileman mask on her head.\n\r

She has a princess candy apple in her hand.
Marika
「A-Ahahaha... Do I look like a kid right now?」
％Ｂ
「I think it's fine. We're at a festival, so you should have lots of fun.」

Marika
「But I made you buy all this...」
％Ｂ
「What are you saying that for? These are all presents for my girlfriend.」

Marika
「Huh? Presents...」
％Ｂ
「Well, they're nothing much, really, but...」
Marika
「Oh, okay... Presents... W-Wah～ ...I-I'm so happy～」

She gently pets the mask, tears welling up in her eyes.
％Ｂ
「Wha? Y-You're gonna cry? That's kinda overreacting, don't you think?」

Marika
「I can't help it, I'm so happy...」
Now that I think about it, this is the first time I've given her something as a present since we've started dating.

％Ｂ
「...Maybe I should've given you something a little better.」
This kinda-cheap mask's my first present for her...
Marika
「No, that's not true. This is what I wanted! Thank you.」

％Ｂ
「Y-You sure? If you say so...」
％Ｂ
「But I'll get you a more proper present some other time.」
Marika
「...A more proper present?」
％Ｂ
「Huh? Well, it'd be... I dunno.」
I can't really think of anything off the top of my head.
％Ｂ
「Like... a ring?」
Marika
「Hahh～」
Marika
「I think I might not be able to stop crying for a while if I got something like that...」
％Ｂ
「It-It isn't that big of a deal. I'm kind of a bad guy, huh...」

Marika
「Ahaha, you are～ You're always making me cry.」

％Ｂ
「That isn't good, Marika. You can't let yourself get fooled by bad guys like me.」

Marika
「I can't help it, I'm a kid!」
She pats the mask on her head and licks the candy apple.
％Ｂ
「You really are like a kid. You've got red stuff all over your mouth. C'mon, show me your face.」

Marika
「What? Is it really that red? That's a little embarrassing... Maybe I should go wash my mouth somewhere...」


％Ｂ
「Hmm, but there's nowhere to do that here...」
％Ｂ
「Okay. Then how about this bad adult helps you out?」
Marika
「Huh? ...Wh-Where are we going?」
I pull Marika by the hand and escape the crowd.
We step behind some cover.
Marika
「...Mmmh?」
I suddenly claim Marika's lips.
The slightly sour sweetness of the candy apple fills my mouth as I kiss her deeply.

I place my tongue into her mouth.
Marika
「Amh, nh... nh...」
She looks a little hesitant, but she tangles her tongue back around mine.

Marika
「Mmh... Nh, chu... chuh... nnh...」
We continue trading deep kisses, exchanging sweet saliva back and forth.
Marika
「Mmh... hafh... Geez... You're so forceful...」

％Ｂ
「Sorry about that. But now your mouth's clean.」

Marika
「Of course it is... You licked it all over...」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, like a dog. Did that feel gross?」

Marika
「...good.」
％Ｂ
「Hm?」
Marika
「It felt good～」
％Ｂ
「Uh...」
Marika's eyes have been watery all night.
She looks down bashfully and fidgets.
％Ｂ
「Mm... Let's get back, then. Here, hold my hand.」
Marika
「Y-Yes!」
I hold out my hand, and she grips it. I can feel just a bit of sweat on the palm of her hand.

Marika
「...」
％Ｂ
「Uh...」
Marika's hiding her face with the mask for some reason.
％Ｂ
「Wh-What are you wearing the mask for?」
Marika
「Because... it's kind of embarrassing to look at you now.」

Her ears peeking out from behind the mask are red.
I bet her cheeks are bright red too.
％Ｂ
「It's getting a little hot. I know. How about some shaved ice?」

Marika
「I want some♪」
Well that was easy.
％Ｂ
「But you can't eat it with that mask on, can you?」
Marika
「Uuuh... I'll take it off then... I want to eat shaved ice...」
Looks like eating shaved ice is higher priority than being embarrassed for her.
％Ｂ
「Your tongue might get red again if you pick strawberry, eh?」
Marika
「Don't worry, I'll pick lemon. Because you'll do perverted things to me again if I make my mouth red～」

％Ｂ
「...You've got me.」
Marika
「Ahahahaha, too bad!」
％Ｂ
「I guess I'll just have to do without... Oh, they've got balloon yo-yo fishing too. You mind if I give it a try later?」

Marika
「Are you confident?」
％Ｂ
「There's a trick to it. You twist the paper string they give you and make sure it doesn't get wet while you hook the yo-yo.」


％Ｂ
「I'll get a bunch for you.」
Marika
「I'm excited♪ I can't wait～」
Marika
「Wow! You're amazing!」
The yo-yo Marika's playing with makes little slapping sounds as it bounces off her hand.
％Ｂ
「Guess I am. I might've gotten a bit serious...」
As for me, I'm holding an armful of yo-yos.
I got a little too into it because I was able to get them just the way I wanted to.
Marika
「I'm so amazed you got this many with just 100 yen～ You're just so good with your hands. It's so impressive.」

Marika's so excited.
I guess it's fine, as long as she's enjoying it.
％Ｂ
「But what should I do with all of these...」
It's not like I can play with all of these at once.
It'd be a waste to throw them away...
Marika
「Mmm, it'd be nice if there were someone who wanted some...」
Rikuto
「Oh, it's Onii-chan and Teacher!!」
I spot three kids running toward us.
They're the ones who helped us out with catching the fish.
％Ｂ
「Oh, you guys. We sure run into each other a lot. And "Teacher"? Is he talking about you, Marika?」

Marika
「Ahaha, yeah. Didn't I tell you that they came to the swim class at the pool?」

％Ｂ
「Oh yeah, now that you mention it.」
So that's why she's "Teacher" to them.
Miyuki
「I'm going to learn how to swim♪」
％Ｂ
「I get it now. I'm glad you're doing well.」
Marika
「So you guys are all here too～」
Miyuki
「Yeah! Are you guys on a date?」
Marika
「A date? ...Y-Yeah, we are...」
Rikuto
「Ohhh! A date! A date!」
Itsuki
「A date! A date!」
Marika
「N-No yelling now～ It-It's embarrassing...」

Miyuki
「Did you two kiss?」
％Ｂ
「Wha...!? How did you know!?」
Itsuki
「Oh, you really did!」
Marika
「Awawa...」
O-Oh no... I lost my cool...
Talking to kids, too. What have I done...
Rikuto
「Kiiiissed! Kiiiissed!」
Marika
「S-Stop thiiis! Don't say that so loudly...」
％Ｂ
「Here! I'll give you some yo-yos, so go play with these somewhere else!」
The kids' eyes light up when they see the pile of water balloon yo-yos.
Rikuto
「Can we have all of these!?」
％Ｂ
「It's a special deal, got it?」
Miyuki
「Wooow, yay♪」
Rikuto
「Okay! Let's go play with them over there!」
Itsuki
「Onii-chan, Teacher, thanks!!」
The kids leave, taking the pile of yo-yos with them.
％Ｂ
「They're so happy about a bunch of yo-yos. They're so easy.」

Marika
「Hehe. Kids are so cute～ I can't wait to have kids myself...」

％Ｂ
「Uh...」
She said it casually, but those words have a particular way of echoing in me.
Marika realizes it immediately.
Marika
「Oh... I-I didn't mean it that way. I didn't mean like, right away or... I just meant in general, okay? It was only in general!」


％Ｂ
「I-I know that. We're still students...」
Marika
「Y-Yeah, you're right... Yeah...」
An awkward silence follows.
I feel like it wouldn't be manly of me to freak out in response to her saying she wants kids, but I feel like it'd be weird to just agree too...

But...
％Ｂ
「...But it'd be nice someday, yeah.」
I say the words as they come to mind.
I haven't really thought it over much, but it's how I really feel.
Marika
「Oh... Yeah!」
She shows me a dazzling smile.
That smile is so precious to me.
％Ｂ
「Marika.」
Marika
「...Oh...」
I gently pull her by the hand, and she comes closer.
I want to feel my beloved Marika closer to my side.
And as I think that...
％Ｂ
「Huh?」
Something cold makes contact with my head.
It's...
Marika
「...Rain?」
Marika
「W-Wah～!」
It's just a few raindrops at first, but it takes no time to become a downpour.
It's a sudden evening shower.
The festival-goers all start running to escape the rain.
We'll get soaked through too at this rate.
％Ｂ
「This way! Let's go!」
Marika
「O-Okay～!」
We run in a different direction from the other people, and end up at the park.
The two of us run under a roof. Doesn't look like there's many other people here.
Marika
「That was a lot of rain～ ...There was thunder and everything.」
％Ｂ
「You all right?」
Marika
「I'm fine because you put your shirt around me. I'm sure this'll dry in no time, since it's hot out.」

％Ｂ
「Mmm, but you sure you're not cold?」
Marika
「I'm fine, because it's warm when I do this.」
She then pulls her body closer.
I sigh in relief when I feel her body heat.
I feel warmer immediately. Maybe it's because of some kind of synergy between both of our body heats.
Marika
「That was surprising earlier. When we ran into those kids...」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, dates and kisses and whatever. Those are some precocious kids. Though I bet they're cute if they're your own.」


Marika
「Oh, yeah... Y-Yeah, probably...」
She smiles a little bashfully.
Crap. I said something weird again.
I can't help but remember her talking about wanting kids.
Marika
「You remembered something... a bit weird just now, didn't you?」
％Ｂ
「Uh... You can tell?」
Marika
「Aha, of course I can～ We're always together, and I'm always thinking about you. That's why I can kind of tell what you're thinking, Ryousuke-kun.」


Marika
「Aha, of course I can～ We're always together, and I'm always thinking about you. That's why I can kind of tell what you're thinking.」


％Ｂ
「You're... always thinking about me?」
Marika
「...Yeah, I am. I'm all full of thinking about you.」

Marika
「...Yeah, I am. I'm all full of thinking about you.」

She pushes her body even closer.
I feel like my body temperature rose again.
Looks like the rain's gotten stronger outside.
I take a look around.
There's no one around, and it doesn't look like anyone's approaching.
％Ｂ
「Marika...」
Marika
「Oh...」
I can't stop myself anymore.
I hold her close and kiss her.
Marika presses her own lips back onto mine.
Marika
「Amh... Nh... mmchu... kh... aah...」
Marika's scent fills my chest as we kiss deeply.
I want more of her.
The more we press together, the more my passion builds.
％Ｂ
「Marika...」
Marika
「Nnh... fuah, nh... aah... Hmh, aah... nh, nnh, fuan, auh...」

Marika blissfully closes her eyes and tangles her tongue around mine.

Marika
「Amh, chu... nnh, aahn, chuph, ahu, aah, chuhh...」
She goes after my tongue hungrily and aggressively, paying no attention to the saliva around her lips.\n\r

I taste the inside of Marika's mouth, as if competing with her.
But no matter how much I taste, it's not even close to enough.
If anything, it just makes me want her more and more. I can't take it anymore.

％Ｂ
「Marika... I love you.」
I rub her body all over, whispering in her ear and kissing her.
I stroke her back, her waist, even her butt.
Marika
「Aah... Nooo... aahn...」
She's hesitating, but it doesn't sound like she doesn't like it.
I want to feel Marika more. I rub her body more aggressively.
Marika
「Aah, nh... You can't. Not here...」
Marika looks around worriedly.
％Ｂ
「No one's here. Look.」
The rain's still pouring.
There's no one around as far as I can see.
Marika
「You're right, but... it's kind of strange. There were so many people just a few minutes ago, but now we're suddenly alone...」


％Ｂ
「Yeah, you're right... It's kinda almost too good to be true.」
Marika
「T-Too good to be... What do you mean? Oh...! Y-You mean... You want to do it... until the end...?」


％Ｂ
「Well... yeah. I'll admit it, I'm totally turned on... 'cause you're so cute.」


Marika
「W-Wah～」
Her face goes red.
Marika
「We can't do it in a place like this... A-And I'm... not as turned on as you are...」

％Ｂ
「You were just kissing me like crazy, though.」

Marika
「Th-That was... kissing is like... It's like a greeting...」
％Ｂ
「Hmm～ ...That so? Maybe...」
Marika
「Wh-What...?」
％Ｂ
「Maybe... you were turned on, 'cause you thought someone might see us?」

Marika
「Tha...That's not true...」
Marika's voice gets a bit shrill.
She's shrunk herself down, bright red in my arms. I kinda just wanna eat her up.

％Ｂ
「You're so cute, Marika.」
I kiss her on the neck.
Marika
「Nooo... Y-You can't... Aahn♪」
I rub her butt again as I rain down kisses onto her.
This time, I get bolder by pulling her yukata up.
Marika
「Aaah, nooo... You'll mess up the yukata...」
％Ｂ
「I wanna see you looking sexy.」
Marika
「...Hauh... That's dirty... b-but you'll really mess it up...」

She pulls away.
Marika
「...So I'll do it myself.」
She blushes and starts rolling up the hem of her yukata herself.

Marika
「The rain's stopped～ The stars are so pretty...」
Marika looks up at the sky and sighs appreciatively.
％Ｂ
「It's got nothing on the sky we made, though.」
Marika
「Ahaha, you're right.」
We lean against each other and look up at the night sky.
all
Marika
「Oh, right. Speaking of which, today's apparently the peak night for the Perseid meteor shower.」

％Ｂ
「Is it? So are we going to get to see some shooting stars, then?」
I squint up at the stars, but they're not really moving.
Marika
「3 a.m.'s apparently when you get to see them the most, so it might still be too early.」

％Ｂ
「3 a.m., huh? Guess we can't really see that together, then.」
I'd be fine with it, but there's no way I could get Marika out of the house that late at night.\n\r

Plus, I'd feel like I'd be betraying her dad's wishes too.
％Ｂ
「It's a shame, but there's always next year.」
Marika
「Yeah. Next year, the year after that... and after that too.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. We'll have all the time in the world from now on.」
Marika
「...Yeah. Ehehehehe...」
She giggles ticklishly.
Now that I've said it out loud, I feel like everything's connected to our future.

％Ｂ
「I'm gonna become an architect.」
So the words naturally come out of my mouth.
％Ｂ
「I wanna be someone that makes places that are comfortable for people. Places where people can be happy.」

Marika
「I think it fits you perfectly. I know you'll become an architect that makes beautiful houses.」

％Ｂ
「Do you have any dreams for the future, Marika?」
Marika
「Oh, well～ ...Actually, I want to be a nursery school teacher.」

％Ｂ
「So you mean... you wanna teach little kids?」
Marika
「Mhm, yeah. I've had lots of people supporting me ever since I was small. That's why... I wanted to be able to repay the favor once I grow up.」


％Ｂ
「Really... I think it's a great dream.」
Marika
「But... there's one more dream I have.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah? And what is it?」
Marika
「U-Umm... Umm, well...」
Marika
「...I want to be a bride.」
％Ｂ
「Oh...」
She sounds a little embarrassed.
But it's a clear wish.
Marika's bright red, but she looks right at me.
％Ｂ
「Hey. I...」
Marika
「...M-Mhm.」
％Ｂ
「I swear I'll make you happy, Marika. I promise, so...」
Marika
「...Mhm...」
％Ｂ
「I want us... to always be together.」
Marika
「Hauh...」
She gives a quiet little gasp.
She wipes the corners of her eyes hard, trying to stop the tears in advance.
Marika
「I would also like... to always be together～」
And she gently clings to me.
