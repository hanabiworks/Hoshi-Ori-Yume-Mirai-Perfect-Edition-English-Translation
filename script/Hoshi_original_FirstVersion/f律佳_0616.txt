Rikka
「I'm Narusawa Rikka, from class 2-C. Pleased to meet you.」
She bows politely.
The event committee members greet her straightforward introduction with applause.
Shuuichi
「I was planning to have you help with the concert organization team for the Tanabata Festival. Is that okay with you?」

Rikka
「The concert team? Not with 
Hino-kun?
％Ａ-kun?
」
Shuuichi
「Did you want to be with him?」
％Ｂ
「Uh...」
Rikka
「N-No, I meant... I just thought I'd be with him, since he was the one who invited me to join!」
Shuuichi
「Sorry, but we don't have much leeway in terms of our member count. You're just the right person for the concert team. As for what the concert team does―」
Shuuichi
「You know about the Shio-cademy Fest that we do for the Tanabata Festival every year, right? It's mostly preparing the documents and such for that, attending meetings and recruiting involved parties...」

Shuuichi
「And you'll be working to make sure things run smoothly on the day of too. There'll also be just a few separate music-related things for the Tanabata Festival that you'll be working on too.」

Shuuichi
「That's pretty much the job in a nutshell. Will you do it?」
Rikka
「I don't mind.」
Shuuichi
「Though our motto here in the event committee's that we all help one another out with stuff. We're not too strict with our role assignment.」

Shuuichi
「We only assign roles to clarify responsibilities, so it'd be great if you could help out with as much as you can if you find the time.」

Rikka
「...I see. I'll consider it when I'm free.」
Shuuichi
「That's pretty much it for me. I think you can hear the rest from Ishizuka-san, who's in charge of the concert team.」

all
Ishizuka
「I'm Ishizuka, the third year in charge of the concert team. I'm pleased to meet you, Narusawa-san.」
Ishizuka
「I'm sure there'll be lots of things that you don't understand at first, so feel free to ask me any questions you might have.」

Ishizuka
「Though the student performer applications and stage construction are already finished, and those are the parts that take the most effort. You won't need to be too tensed up.」

Ishizuka
「But there are still a few of the local artists who haven't responded to our offers.」
According to Shuuichi, you need to turn in a participation form by the end of May if you want to be in the Shio-cademy Fest.
They're accepted by June 20th after the committee verifies the paperwork and does some cursory research on them.

It's apparently a preventative measure against people who want to do something absolutely crazy for their performance, which happens year after year.

June 20th is also the deadline for invited artists to respond.

In addition to student performances, the Shio-cademy Fest invites musicians who have ties to the area to spice things up.
all
Ishizuka
「Who was it again who hasn't responded yet...?」
Ishizuka-san flips through a folder with the words "Shio-cademy Fest '14" printed on the cover.

Ishizuka
「Nagai-san the saxophonist, Kase-san the singer-songwriter... and Narusawa-san the pianist, and her daughter... I guess those might all be long shots...」

Rikka
「You've invited my mom and Meguru?」
Ishizuka
「Oh, that's right! You're one of Narusawa Sayaka-san's daughters too! We invite her every year, but she's never once agreed to come...」


Ishizuka
「And Meguru-san won first place at an international competition last year, didn't she? I remember that was all over the news for a while.」
Ishizuka
「Would it be possible for you to ask either of them to participate?」
Rikka
「I'm sorry. They're both very busy, so I couldn't really...」
Ishizuka
「Oh, okay～ ...That's a shame...」
％Ｂ
「...」
Narusawa's mom and younger sister.
They're both world-renowned musicians...
I wonder what they're like.
all
％Ｂ
「What's your mom like, Narusawa?」
Rikka
「Well... She just loves music. She lives and breathes piano.」

Rikka
「Why? Are you interested in my mom?」
％Ｂ
「Well, I guess you could call it an interest. I was just kinda curious about what your family's like.」

Rikka
「...You just act more and more like a stalker every day.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, come on! I was just asking about a friend's parent!」
Rikka
「A friend. Hmmmh... And by the way, why are you just walking home with me like this?」

％Ｂ
「I freakin' asked to go home together, didn't I!? Why are you acting like I came along without your consent!?」

Rikka
「I never said anything in response.」
％Ｂ
「I thought it was okay 'cause you didn't say anything.」
Rikka
「Seems our opinions differ.」
She says that, but she's still walking and talking with me.
％Ｂ
「Well, I invited you to join the committee, right? Today's your first actual day, so I thought it'd be nice to at least hear what you think of it.」

Rikka
「What I think... Well... It wasn't boring enough to make me want to quit today.」


％Ｂ
「Really. That's good then.」
Rikka
「Though I might just quit if I start not liking it.」
％Ｂ
「What the heck, you said you'd join, didn't you? I thought we were gonna both put our all into this.」

Rikka
「I told you I'd join, but I never said I'd stay.」
％Ｂ
「You're just being difficult now!」
Rikka
「But I didn't, did I?」
％Ｂ
「Kh...!」
％Ｂ
「Then I'm just gonna make sure the committee's so fun you'd never even consider quitting! I'll never let you quit!」


Rikka
「Hehe. I'm looking forward to it.」
