We assemble again at school in the morning.
We finished cutting out the new templates yesterday.
We cut out the salvageable parts of the old dome and made as many new parts as we could.

Unfortunately, the cardboard-collection effort isn't going as well as we had hoped...

Natsuki
「Guess things just don't go the way you want...」

Touko
「Mmm, this is hard...」
all
We were expecting it to some extent, but cardboard of the quality and sizes we need isn't the kind of thing you can come across all the time.

Most of it's been claimed by the other clubs over the last few weeks for the festival.\n \n\r
I asked Shuuichi to ask the other clubs in the school to see if they had a surplus or anything, but we haven't gotten any favorable answers...

We're still trying to make a six-meter-diameter dome, which means we'll still need about as much cardboard as the old design.

And we currently only have about half the amount we need...
％Ｂ
「I'll go with the others to gather cardboard today. Sora and Narusawa, you two keep practicing the talk.」

Sora
「...We will.」
Rikka
「Wait. Then you should stay with her, not me.」
％Ｂ
「Wha... Me?」
Rikka
「It seems like I just make Ousaka-san nervous... I think she might be able to do it better if you were the one watching over her.」


Marika
「Which do you prefer, Ousaka-san?」
Sora
「...
Ryou
Mm..
.」
She points at me.
Rikka
「That's how it is.」
％Ｂ
「Uh... Okay, but...」
all
Misa
「Please don't mind us. Be by Sora-san's side.」
Misa
「Anyone can collect cardboard, but you are the only one who can support Sora-san.」

％Ｂ
「I understand. I'll leave the cardboard to all of you, then.」

all
Touko
「No flirting around just because we're not around, okay?」
％Ｂ
「W-We're not gonna do anything like that... This is school.」

Natsuki
「Ahaha, the way you're saying it just makes it more suspicious! Let's get going, then! Go find that brown treasure!」

all
Rikka
「I don't know if I want to find any after hearing you say that...」
Marika
「We'll be going, then.」
％Ｂ
「Good luck.」
Sora
「...Good luck.」
all
％Ｂ
「All right then... How about we get started too?」
Sora
「...Yes.」
all
Sora
「...Please look to the eastern sky.」
Sora
「...You can see a very bright star above the Milky Way. A star so bright, one can see it clearly even with the naked eye... This is one of the representative stars of the summer season... Vega, in the constellation Lyra.」


％Ｂ
「...」
Sora's talking's improved substantially.
Her phrasing's become more proper, her tone more narrative.
It's a lot better compared to before.
Sora
「Vega is also famous as Orihime from the legend of Tanabata. I'm sure everyone knows... is aware of the legend of Tanabata, yes?」

Though there's still a few parts that need to be ironed out...
Sora
「There is another star on the other side of the Milky Way from Orihime. Now then... Whatever could this star be?」

％Ｂ
「...」
Sora
「...What could it be?」
％Ｂ
「Oh, it wasn't a rhetorical question... Uhh... Hikoboshi.」
Sora
「Yes, Hikoboshi. Orihime and Hikoboshi are married stars. Now then, let us find Hikoboshi next.」

So she's even asking questions of the audience now...
Not bad at all.
Sora
「If one starts at Vega and crosses the Milky Way to the southeast... One would come across another star, shining beautifully in the night sky.」

％Ｂ
「...」
Sora continues talking, pointing as if the stars were before her right this very moment.

Her explanation is comfortable to listen to.
I can really feel how much Sora wants to communicate the wonder of the stars.
Sora
「...It is a star whose beauty does not lose even to Orihime... Hikoboshi, Orihime's husband... Also known as Altair, the constellation Aquila's first-magnitude star.」

There aren't any stars on the ceiling, but I remember the night skies I've seen together with Sora up until now.

I can see them before me.
A beautiful starry sky expanding before me... Vega, Altair, and Deneb. The splendor of the Summer Triangle...

all
Shinozaki and the others come back at around sunset.
％Ｂ
「Welcome back.」
Sora
「...Welcome back.」
Marika
「...We're back.」
Everyone looks somewhat gloomy.
％Ｂ
「...How'd it go?」

Natsuki
「It was a total bust... We got even less than yesterday.」
％Ｂ
「...I see.」
I look at the cardboard they've brought back with them. Segawa's right.
all
Touko
「There was some real thin stuff... but it wouldn't be strong enough to use, right?」


Rikka
「There were thicker sheets too, but they were already a little damp and soft.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, those wouldn't be usable...」
all
Misa
「With the time we have remaining in mind, I believe... things may become fairly difficult if we are unable to get what we need by tomorrow...」

Sora
「...」
all
Okihara-senpai's talking as if there were room for us to be optimistic... but that's impossible.
We have to cut out the parts, paint them, and then put everything together... 
So we'd want the materials by today.
Maybe we should scale it down to four meters in diameter...
Actually, I don't know if we'll have enough for even that.
Everyone looks at me worriedly as I think to myself.

I wish I could say something encouraging, but I can't think of anything.
But I'm sure everyone feels the same way.
We're all aware of our current situation.
Which is why we're all hesitant to be the first to speak.
all
The sound of my phone ringing cuts through the heavy mood.
％Ｂ
「...Shuuichi?」

_smh_st_02
_smh_st_btn05
％Ｂ
「...Hello?」
Shuuichi
『There's a guest for you at the school gates right now.』
％Ｂ
「Wha...? A guest for me?」
Shuuichi
『Yeah. They came by car, so they wanted to ask you to come out to meet them. Are you in the old school building right now? If you are, then go out to them.』

％Ｂ
「S-Sure... I'll head there right now.」
_smh_st_04
...A guest for me... who came by car? Who is it?
Sora
「...What happened?」
％Ｂ
「Well, there's apparently a guest for me here. I'll be right back.」

Sora
「...*nod*」
Staff
「Hey there.」
％Ｂ
「Oh... Hello.」
So it was the man from the chamber of commerce.
What's he here for?
Staff
「I brought the stuff we talked about.」
％Ｂ
「Wha... Stuff we talked about?」
Staff
「Oh, come on now. You're the one who asked for all this. Remember? The cardboard.」

％Ｂ
「Oh...!」
The truckbed's stacked full of sturdy-looking cardboard.

％Ｂ
「Wha... Wha...? Is this... really...?」
Staff
「I had the entire marketplace get this together. The city's Tanabata Festival's happening soon, so I had them open up boxes of goods from storage to prepare early for the sales and got them to give me all this.」


Staff
「I think I could get maybe a little more if this isn't enough.」
％Ｂ
「Oh no! This is more than enough! This is so much... Thank you so much!」
Staff
「Everyone pitched in for Shio-wan and Shio-nyah's sake. Good for you.」

％Ｂ
「Tha...Thank you... Thank you so very much!」

I bow my head low.
Staff
「If you want to thank anyone, then you should thank the shopowners of the... Actually, maybe I could have you be Shio-wan again for the Tanabata Festival. Ahaha!」

％Ｂ
「I-I'll do it! I'll be Shio-wan as much as you want!」
I can't believe he brought so much...
I think I might cry from happiness.
％Ｂ
「I'll call my friends over to carry it right away!」
I call Sora.
Sora
『...Hello?』
％Ｂ
「Get everyone out here to the front gates right away!」
We'll make it in time now...
We'll be able to complete the planetarium!
