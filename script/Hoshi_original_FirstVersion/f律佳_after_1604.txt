―April.
The cherry blossoms dance.
％Ｂ
「Ohh, so that's a cherry tree out front... That's awesome.」

The ground is absolutely covered in pink flower petals outside the window.
The flowers are in full bloom.
Rikka
「Hehe, it's really pretty... Okay, this is good. I've gotten everything I might need in the near future organized. How about you?」


％Ｂ
「I'm pretty much done unpacking too.」
It's the beginning of a new season.
The start of a new life.
This is the first day Rikka and I are living together.
Rikka
「Hey, Ryousuke...」
Rikka
「Hey...」
％Ｂ
「Hm?」
I turn away from the window toward Rikka...
To see her sitting on her knees, directly facing me.
Rikka
「Starting today, I will be in your care for many years to come.」
She brings her fingers together for a very proper bow.
％Ｂ
「Likewise for me.」
I bow my head back.
I stay like that for a while... then raise my head...
％Ｂ
「Pff...」
Rikka
「Hehe! It's kind of embarrassing, isn't it...」
We look at each other and smile.
％Ｂ
「Let's hold off on organizing the rest of our stuff for now and go out shopping. There's a lot we still need to buy.」

Rikka
「That's true. Like matching chopsticks, rice bowls, cups, keystraps, toothbrushes... and pajamas too, hehe.」

％Ｂ
「I remember. We promised to go buy them together.」
It was back when I stayed the night during a hurricane during high school.
％Ｂ
「But isn't it going to be kinda inconvenient to have all our stuff match? I know we need to buy that stuff, but still.」

We've both gotten plates and stuff from our families for guest use, the kind of stuff that our parents had been keeping stowed away for gifting purposes.

But my parents suggested to me that it'd be a good idea for us to buy what we'll typically be using ourselves.
They said it'd make our life together feel richer.
Rikka
「...Should we not? I've always wanted things that matched with yours.」

％Ｂ
「Well, we're finally living together, so I guess we might as well go all the way.」
I could never deny her when she looks at me pleadingly like that...

Rikka
「Ehehe! I love you sooo much, Ryousuke!」
Rikka
「Ehehe! I love you sooo much!」
She presses herself against my chest.
She rubs her cheek against me like she always does.
Rikka
「Mmm～ ...I love this smell... Sniff sniff... Hafhhh...」
％Ｂ
「You smell good too, Rikka. Also, you know we can't go shopping like this.」

Rikka
「Mhm... Just for a little longer. We're going to be living here. Hehe, I'm so excited I think I might die.」

％Ｂ
「You say that every now and then, don't you? About how you might die.」
Rikka
「I'm not really doing it on purpose, but I think it's a habit of mine. I think I just can't help but say it when something really wonderful happens.」

％Ｂ
「Sounds like I might be hearing about how you might die every day from now on, then.」
Rikka
「I'm sure you will. Because I'm always going to be with you from now on.」

％Ｂ
「I think I might die too.」
Rikka
「Hehe... Ehehe, ahaha...!」
I pull Rikka close as she giggles and hug her tight.
It's just so much fun talking with her about silly stuff like this.
Our life together is filled with ticklishness.
Rikka
「Mmmmh～～～ chu... It's morning. You should wake up...」
％Ｂ
「Nnh... nnhhh...」
Rikka
「Your warm breakfast's going to get cold. Do I need to kiss you more...? Chu... chufh... kchu.」


％Ｂ
「Nh... aaah...」
...What's going on?
There's a squishy, soft weight on top of me...
I peel my eyelids apart from each other.
Rikka
「Chu... mmchuuh... chu, kchu... Wake up, or I'm going to give you lots of good-morning kisses... Chu, chu, chuuuh...」
Rikka's got her arms around my neck as she kisses me.
Her boobs are pressed against my chest.
Rikka
「Chupah... Oh, hehe, you're finally awake. Good morning. We start university today. We don't want to be late on our first day, right?」

％Ｂ
「Oh, right... Thanks. Good morning. Being woken up with kisses is great.」

She'd come over to my house or we'd stay the night at a hotel sometimes back in high school...

And Rikka would always wake me up with kisses.
And she'd occasionally give me a treat by waking me up with a morning blowjob too.\n\r
Her being so devoted even in the mornings makes me so happy, it's a little scary.
％Ｂ
「Rikkaaa～」
Rikka
「Hyah!?」
I pull Rikka by the hand into the bed.
I position myself so she's straddling my thigh.
I sit up.
Rikka's face is right there in front of me.
Rikka
「Ehehe.」
％Ｂ
「Hahaha.」
We're close enough for our noses to touch, looking into each other's eyes. We've done this so many times already, but it always makes us blush.

It's always a fresh kind of excitement.
Rikka
「Mmmm～～～ ...Chu. Ehehe.」
We kiss.
And we look at each other again...
Rikka
「Mmm～～～ ...Chu, chuuu. Ehehe.」
We kiss again, and look at each other again.
Rikka
「Mmm～～～ ...Chu, chu, chuuuh. Ehehe.」
Yet another kiss.
And we don't forget to look at each other either.
Rikka
「Mmmm～～～...」
We go in for the fourth kiss in a row.
Time passes comfortably.
all
I eat breakfast and get ready to go.
Now that I'm full...
％Ｂ
「Kuaaahhhh～～～」
I'm sleepy.
Rikka
「Hehe, what a big yawn. You were up late last night staring at your syllabus book, weren't you?」

By syllabus book, she means the book that describes the content, scheduling, and goals of each of the university classes.

％Ｂ
「I was just thinking about what classes I should take to get closer to my dream. I asked Mr. Azuma, but he just told me to take whatever classes I want.」

I'm already required to take the classes for fundamentals and foundations of architecture.
I can use my electives and general education classes to further broaden my horizons as an architect.
Mr. Azuma probably wanted to say that there are no downsides to taking anything.
I just picked classes in fields that seemed interesting.
Several of those are the same as Rikka's.
％Ｂ
「I hear they make it a lottery to get into the popular classes, so it'd be great if we ended up in the same ones.」
Unlike high school, this is going to be pretty much the only way we can be together in a class, because we're both in different departments.

Rikka
「Mhm. We were together for our second and third years at Shionagi Academy, so it'd make me a little bit sad to take classes alone.」

％Ｂ
「Me too, but we should just be happy that we ended up at the same university at all. Plus, we can see each other when we have breaks between classes and at home.」


Rikka
「Mhm! I'll save up all my love for you while I can't see you, and cuddle with you lots when I do.」

The two of us are moving forward, side by side.
Toward each of our dreams.
all
We grab our bags and head to the door.
％Ｂ
「Speaking of, what kinda stuff do you take as a piano major?」
Rikka
「Solo recital, chamber music, ensemble, solfège, piano technique, choir, harmonics, music theory, music history... I'm planning to take lessons with Schiele-sensei.」

％Ｂ
「I know I asked, but I have no idea what you just said... And wait, so you're really taking lessons from that weirdo perv guy...」

Rikka
「Hehe, that's the reason why I came here. And besides, he's not as weird or as perverted as you think he is.」


％Ｂ
「Well yeah, that's 'cause you're his student. I'm talking about how he acts normally. He invited me out to a cabaret club to celebrate graduating, you know.」

Rikka
「A cabaret... club? Hmm, a cabaret club... You've gotten on very good terms with him, haven't you? Isn't that a good thing.」

Rikka's eyes go cold.
％Ｂ
「Wait, no, obviously I said no! Why would I go somewhere like that when I have you!?」

Rikka
「But you wanted to try going a bit, didn't you? I can see it written on you. Right・here. Hehe... I won't get mad, so you can tell me.」

She brings her face closer and pokes my face with her index finger.

％Ｂ
「Uh, well, yeah. I was kinda curious what it was like. Sigh... I can't hide anything from you, can I?」

Rikka
「I know you very well. And so, a question for you. What am I thinking right now?」

％Ｂ
「What are you thinking?」
So she's asking if I know her just as well?
Rikka's beaming up at me in front of the door.
She was probably never actually angry in the first place.
Hmm～
Oh, if we're at the front door...
We did this a lot in high school too.
She doesn't want me to guess what she's thinking. It's more like she wants me to do something.
And I think I can more or less guess what that is too.
％Ｂ
「We trade off for when we're both leaving at the same time, right?」
Rikka
「Mhm, correct... Oh, I want it to be a bit longer now that we've started living together. I want to feel your love lots.」
％Ｂ
「We were just kissing earlier. You sure love kissing.」
Rikka
「Uuuuhhh... The send-off kiss is different. And I could kiss you a million times and it still wouldn't be enough.」

％Ｂ
「Close your eyes.」
Rikka
「...Mm.」
She closes her eyes, and I hold her by the shoulders.
％Ｂ
「I'm going... Chuph.」
Rikka
「Chu... pchu, pchummh, hamh... Mlh, chlh... Chuph, chu, chuuuh...」
It's a longer kiss than we'd usually do in high school, and just a little bit dirty.
It's the send-off kiss for a couple living together.
This is... just about my limit.
There's a part of me that'll go crazy if we overdo it, and we'd really end up being late.
Rikka
「Chupah... Ehehe, have a nice day. I'll be going too... Mh... chu, chuph, mlh... Hafh, slurp... kshu, chuh...」

％Ｂ
「Chufh... Have a nice day.」
Rikka
「Do you have the lunchbox I put on the table?」
％Ｂ
「I've got it. Let's eat together for lunch.」
We may be in university now, but Rikka's still making lunchboxes for both of us.
Rikka
「Mhm. Let me know when your classes are done. Let's go.」
We hold hands.
Like lovers.
％Ｂ
「Oh, is today the day for plastics?」
We've divided up the enormous amount of trash from our move into all the right groups, and packed everything into trash bags.

I grab the bag filled with plastics.
Rikka's locking the door.
％Ｂ
「You're working at the café today?」
Rikka
「Until 9 p.m.」
The music café Rikka works at is on Shionagi's main street.
She normally works as a waiter, and she plays piano if there are any customer requests.

I've been there a few times. It's a really classy place with nice ambiance.

％Ｂ
「I'll be going to Mr. Azuma's today in the afternoon, and I think I'll be done around then, so I'll come pick you up.」

Rikka
「Ehehe, thank you. I'll be waiting, then.」
I can smell the clear fragrance of the morning sea breeze.
I look down to see the ocean not too far away.
Landlady
「Oh, good morning, you two.」
Our landlady's cleaning up around the garden.
％Ｂ & Rikka
「Good morning.」
Landlady
「Fufu, you're in perfect step. What a couple of lovebirds. You're university students starting today. Good luck, and have a nice day.」

％Ｂ & Rikka
「We'll be going.」
Landlady
「Ufufu!」
She smiles and sees us off as we begin our new school life.
