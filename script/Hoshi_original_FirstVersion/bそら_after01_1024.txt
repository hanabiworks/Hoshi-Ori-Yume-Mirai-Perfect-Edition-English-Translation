Junior Firm Staff
「Senpai. I'll be going home for the day.」
％Ｂ
「Sure thing. I'll handle the rest.」
Junior Firm Staff
「Thank you very much. See you again tomorrow.」
％Ｂ
「Good work today.」
I'm the only one left in the office now that everyone else has gone home for the day.

％Ｂ
「Senpai, huh...」
It's been five years since I graduated university and started working here in Azuma-san's firm.\n\r
Almost all of the senior members of the firm who had been here back when I first joined have become independent at this point.

I've got lots of junior coworkers now.
％Ｂ
「Five years... It's felt both long and short...」
I've gotten my first-class architect qualification, as well as my managerial architect qualifications.\n\r

I've gotten to experience doing lots of different kinds of work.
Azuma-san's been helping me out in lots of different ways ever since I came back to this town.

％Ｂ
「...I'm real grateful to Azuma-san.」
I doubt I could ever thank him enough.
Azuma
「What about me?」
％Ｂ
「Agh...!?」
I stand up a little at my desk in surprise when Azuma-san appears out of nowhere.

％Ｂ
「O-Oh, Teacher... I didn't know you were here.」
Azuma
「It's my firm. You got a problem with me being here?」
％Ｂ
「...I didn't say I did.」
Azuma
「So you'll be done here in a week.」
％Ｂ
「Yes. Thank you very much for everything.」
That's right... After five years of working here at the Azuma Architectural Firm, it's finally time for me to leave and become independent.

Azuma
「And yet here you are, staying way past working hours. Working hard, I guess.」

％Ｂ
「I'm putting the paperwork together for whoever takes over my work.」
Azuma
「You don't need to do that. People learn how to work by watching their senior coworkers from behind. You did the same thing.」


％Ｂ
「Yes, it was quite difficult. Even with my seniors being considerate to make sure I could learn more easily from them.」


％Ｂ
「I just don't seem to be as good at being casual about things like that. So I'll be doing it more directly like this.」

Azuma
「Well aren't you nice?」
％Ｂ
「And besides, you're the one who would suffer if my juniors couldn't do their work after I leave.」

Azuma
「Hmph, you've got a point there. All right, then if you're gonna make something like that, then make it perfect. Something that we can make standard procedure in the future.」


％Ｂ
「Oh, I like that idea. It'd be like I'm leaving my mark on the Azuma Architectural Firm. Maybe it could be my way of repaying you a little.」


Azuma
「If it makes my life easier, then I guess it would be.」
Honestly. He only ever cares about making things easier for himself.
Still, though. I'll only get to talk with him like this for another week.
％Ｂ
「...」
Azuma
「Oh, what's wrong? You're looking pretty sentimental. Feeling sad about quitting?」

％Ｂ
「...What about you, Teacher? Are you sad about me leaving?」
Azuma
「Like I'd be caught dead feeling sad about saying goodbye to a guy. Though... it'll be a bit painful in terms of work. You're pretty much our ace at this point.」


％Ｂ
「...That's the first I've heard you say that.」
Azuma
「Of course. It's the first I've said it. You'd just get a big head if I said it normally. Think of it as me doing you a favor, as your mentor.」


％Ｂ
「Now that's not fair... You're making me feel a little bad now.」

Azuma
「You can't say soft stuff like that when you've already decided to become independent.」
％Ｂ
「Yes.」
That's right. I'm quitting this firm so I can become independent and start my own firm.

The best way for me to repay him is to continue to do good work, as someone who was trained at the Azuma Architectural Firm.

Azuma
「Right, also, about the way you address me...」
％Ｂ
「"Teacher"?」
Azuma
「Yeah, that. Stop that once you quit. You won't be one of ours anymore after that. We'll have to treat each other as equals once we're both firm managers.」


％Ｂ
「I can't do that. You'll always be Teacher to me. From now on... Or more like, you always have been, and always will.」

Azuma
「...You're stubborn.」
％Ｂ
「And besides, I might have to come back here if my firm ends up going under.」

Azuma
「Sure, and I will heartily welcome you back like the generous soul I am. Though you'll be starting over from scratch as a new hire.」

％Ｂ
「Making tea and answering the phone again? Have mercy...」

Azuma
「Anyway... Like I already said. It's honestly going to be pretty painful having you leave. I don't wanna have to let go of someone who's starting to get up there in the world. But I'm also happy about it.」


％Ｂ
「...What? You're happy?」
Azuma
「What parent wouldn't be happy about seeing their kid grow up?」
％Ｂ
「...Why do you have to keep saying things like that just when I'm about to leave? ...You're going to make me cry, you know.」

Azuma
「It's because you're leaving that I can say it now.」
Azuma
「Like I always say, architecture's about both creating and imagining. Going out and expanding your worldview's gonna let you create better things than if you just stayed cooped up in the same place the whole time.」


Azuma
「Good luck out there, Hino.」
Azuma
「Good luck out there.」
％Ｂ
「Thank you very much... Teacher.」
Azuma
「...Still, though. When I look back at all this now, a lot of your designs seem pretty inspired by sky stuff, like stars and planets.」


He speaks softly while looking at the design diagrams I had taken out to pack away.

Azuma
「There's the one from last year or the year before... What was it again? The summer retreat one...」

％Ｂ
「The "House for Seeing Stars"?」
Azuma
「Yeah, that one. That was your design that absolutely blew everyone away at that competition.」


％Ｂ
「Thank you very much for the praise.」
Azuma
「Have you always been interested in those kinds of things?」
％Ｂ
「Well, no... How do I explain this... If I had to say, I guess it's my significant other's influence...」

Azuma
「Ah, that's why.」
Azuma
「Hm? Speak of the devil.」
all
％Ｂ
「Indeed.」
I undo the autolock on the front door.
Sora
「...Good evening.」
Sora walks in.
Azuma
「Welcome, Sora-chan.」
Sora
「...Good evening, Mo-san.」
Sora still calls Azuma-san "Mo-san," even after we've become adults.

I once tried to get Sora to stop, but she just told me, "Mo-san told me it was fine," which I didn't really have any way of arguing with.


Azuma-san himself seems to have taken a liking to being called that.

％Ｂ
「...Even though he hates it when I call him Teacher.」
Azuma
「You say something?」
％Ｂ
「No, nothing.」
Azuma
「By the way, when are you two gonna get married?」
％Ｂ
「Why so suddenly?」
Azuma
「It's not sudden. How long have you been dating for? Men can put their all into work more than ever once they have something to protect.」


％Ｂ
「Well, personally... I'm okay with getting married right away, but...」
Sora
「...I'm fine for now.」
％Ｂ
「That's what Sora says, so...」
Azuma
「Are you satisfied with that, Sora-chan?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
Sora
「...I can be by Ryou's side without us getting married, and I can support him.」

Sora
「...We can be together without us getting married, and I can support him.」

Sora
「...I think Ryou would treat me as too important if we get married. He seems skillful, but he can't do two things at once. From a positive perspective, he's earnest. From a negative one... clumsy.」


Sora
「...I think he would treat me as too important if we get married. He seems skillful, but he can't do two things at once. From a positive perspective, he's earnest. From a negative one... clumsy.」


％Ｂ
「Gh...」
Azuma
「I see. I'm impressed, Sora-chan. You've been watching him a lot, haven't you?」

Sora
「...It's natural after dating for ten years. I know mostly everything about Ryou's personality.」

Sora
「...It's natural after dating for ten years. I know mostly everything about his personality.」

Azuma
「Hahahaha, I guess she's got a good hold on your leash. You've got it rough, buddy. Hahahahah!」

％Ｂ
「...There's nothing for me to say...」
all
I leave the firm together with Sora after putting away the paperwork I was doing.\n\r

Well, it's more like Azuma-san kicked me out...
Sora
「...Are your preparations for leaving going well?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah... I'll be done with the paperwork for whoever comes after me soon, so yeah, it's steady progress.」

Sora
「...That's good.」
％Ｂ
「And Teacher's happy that I'm becoming independent too.」
Sora
「...Mo-san may look that way, but he's a very good person.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah... I'm really grateful to him. And to you too.」

Sora
「...Me...?」
％Ｂ
「Your advice was what got me to decide to become independent.」

That's right... It's something that I had been torturing myself over for a long time...
I saw Azuma-san's architectural designs back when I was a student and thought to myself about how I wanted to create buildings like his.

I wanted to become an architect like Azuma-san.
And that dream came true, bit by bit.
Work was incredibly fun for me.
Because learning lots of different things under Azuma-san's tutelage expanded my possibilities as an architect.

My own name became more well known, my pay increased... Feeling my own life become more fulfilling was satisfying to me.

But... there was a part of me deep down that wasn't quite sure if I was truly satisfied.
I felt like the current me was a little different from the me that I had really envisioned becoming.

That maybe my dream still hadn't come true...
That becoming an architect like Azuma-san meant I should become a goal, a symbol, to someone in the same way he had been for me...

I was still nothing more than someone who admired Azuma-san. And that was because as long as I stayed where I was, I would only be a staff member at the Azuma Architectural Firm!


And once I thought about it that way, one thought came to mind―independence.
Atelier-style architectural firms are pretty common.
But I didn't know if I would succeed.
I was sure I'd lose many different things if I failed.
Azuma-san's trust, all of my achievements up until now...
And so I talked to Sora about it after thinking it over.
Sora
「...I think you're a creator, Ryou.」
Sora
「...I think you're a creator.」
％Ｂ
「Hmm... Well, you need to be creative to be an atelier-style architect, so I guess you could call it that.」

Sora
「...Does a creator only create things?」
％Ｂ
「...What's that supposed to mean?」
Sora
「...Mo-san pushed you along the path of an architect through his works.」

Sora
「...Mo-san pushed you along the path of an architect through his works.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah... I wouldn't be who I am today if I hadn't started admiring him.」
Sora
「...I think a creator is someone who creates a new era.」
％Ｂ
「A new... era...」
Sora
「...That's what it means to become Mo-san.」
％Ｂ
「...」
Sora
「...You might lose lots of things if you fail at becoming independent.」

Sora
「...You might lose lots of things if you fail at becoming independent.」

Sora
「But there's something you'll never lose.」
％Ｂ
「What's that?」
Sora
「...My feelings for you.」
Sora
「...My feelings for you.」
％Ｂ
「Sora...」
Sora
「...You should do what you want to do. I'll support you from your side. Always.」

Sora
「...You should do what you want to do. I'll support you from your side. Always.」

％Ｂ
「I'm pretty sure I'd still be agonizing over it if you hadn't said those words. So it's thanks to you that I'm becoming independent. I'm really grateful, Sora.」


Sora
「...Ryo―」
Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「...That wasn't me.」
Sora
「...It was me... I haven't eaten dinner because I wanted to eat with you.」

Sora
「...I... haven't eaten dinner because I wanted to eat with you.」

％Ｂ
「Okay. Wanna stop somewhere on the way back?」
Sora
「...*shake shake*」
Sora
「...We'll go to your place. I'll cook.」
Sora
「...We'll go to your place. I'll cook.」
I moved out from my parents' house a little while after I started working, and now I live alone in a rented apartment close to the firm.

Sora's got a spare key, so she occasionally comes by on her own to clean or do laundry.

As for what Sora's been up to, she's a navigator for the science museum's planetarium.\n\r

She's made her dream of communicating the wonders of the stars to lots of people come true.
％Ｂ
「How's it been going with you lately? Pretty good?」
I'm asking Sora about her work while eating the dinner she made.

Sora
「...We're still getting fewer visitors. It's a shame.」
％Ｂ
「Really...」
Sora
「...Our planetarium has a projection machine that creates a night sky that's as close as possible to the real thing. We shouldn't lose to any newer planetarium in terms of content...」


％Ｂ
「I guess it has been a long time since the city's science museum was built.」
It makes sense that people would be more attracted toward the newer, prettier buildings than an old one.

％Ｂ
「Speaking of content, how's it going with planning out the new show?」
Sora
「...We're thinking.」
One of the reasons the planetarium thinks it's losing visitors is apparently because it hasn't changed up its stargazing shows much at all these last few years.


As one of the planetarium navigators, Sora's been asked to help with thinking of a new show.

％Ｂ
「A new show for the planetarium... That sounds pretty hard.」

Sora
「...We won't be able to get the visitors to come back with an ordinary show.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah...」
It's outside my area of expertise, but I wanna do something to help her after she helped me make a big decision in my life.


％Ｂ
「Hey, Sora. Wanna go somewhere to see the stars sometime soon, to get some inspiration for your new show?」

Sora
「...A vacation?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. I'll be able to take a bit of a break between leaving Mr. Azuma's firm and starting up my own place.」

It's going to be winter soon.
The dry air's ideal for stargazing... Or at least, that's what Sora's told me before.

％Ｂ
「And besides, you said it before, remember? You can't be a planetarium navigator if you don't go out to look at real stars.」


Sora
「...*nod*」
You need to communicate the wonder, emotions, and impressions you feel when you see real stars to the visitors.\n\r
That's Sora's personal philosophy, and so the two of us have gone to lots of different places to see the stars for dates.

I've become a big fan of the stars myself at this point thanks to that.
Sora
「...*nod* I'll request a vacation.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. I'll look for a nice place. Or if there's anywhere you wanna go, we can go there too.」

Sora
「...*nod*」
all
I'm relaxing after dinner with some tea.
Sora's getting the bath ready in the meantime.
％Ｂ
「You wanna take a bath with me?」
Sora
「...I can't stay the night today. But I have time for a bath.」

bそら_エッチシーン９
I'm driving Sora home after we put our clothes back on.
Sora
「...It's a nice starry night.」
％Ｂ
「I wonder if the mountains would be good for our vacation. Somewhere we could see the stars well.」
Sora
「...*nod* I'll leave it to you.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. Got it.」
Sora
「Ryou.」
Sora
「...Hey.」
％Ｂ
「Hm? What?」
Sora
「Good luck for your last week.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. Thanks.」
We kiss gently in the car, and start getting ready to go.
I'm going to be a little further away from stability from now on... But I get the feeling I'll still be okay.


Because I have the person who's most important to me, right here by my side.
