「Hey, Segawaaa!」
Natsuki
「Hm? Huh? What are you doing?」
％Ｂ
「Just killing some time. You taking photos right now?」

Natsuki
「I am... Actually, you came at a good time. What do you think of this photo?」

％Ｂ
「Huh? I dunno if I'll be much help... I'm an amateur when it comes to photos, so I dunno.」

Natsuki
「I want the opinion of an amateur. Just tell me how it feels to you. Don't hold back, just tell me what's on your mind!」


％Ｂ
「Hmm... Okay, but don't expect much, all right?」
all
I sigh and look at the camera screen.
I see students hard at work doing club activities...
％Ｂ
「...I dunno how to describe it. There's not enough motion... I guess?」
Natsuki
「So you think so too!? That's right! It's not alive!」

Segawa's instantly excited.
It seems like she was worried about the same thing.

Natsuki
「There's not enough motion! I can't communicate the feel of the good times in the scene with this!」

％Ｂ
「S-Sure...?」
Natsuki
「I know! Could you help me a bit?」
％Ｂ
「Help? ...With what?」
Natsuki
「With my photography. There's a lot I can't do on my own, and I don't wanna stop until I get a shot I can be satisfied with!」

％Ｂ
「Uh, I have work too, you know.」
Natsuki
「You just said you were killing time. That means you have nothing to do, right?」

％Ｂ
「I said "some" time, didn't I!? I've got something to... Don't grab my collar! Stop pulling!」

Natsuki
「Come on, come ooon! One of your duties is to support other clubs in times of trouble, you know.」

％Ｂ
「F-Fine, I get it! I'll help! Let go of me!」
Natsuki
「Mhm, good.」
％Ｂ
「Sigh... God, you're so forceful!」
Both Yukimura and Segawa just seem to treat the committee as a utilities service...
Natsuki
「Now then, let's go! We're gonna take as many photos as we can before the athletic clubs are done for the day!」

all
Natsuki
「Okaaay, that's great! Please keep going like that!」
all
％Ｂ
「Hahh... hahh...gh...! I-I can't anymore...!」
I'm completely out of gas after getting dragged around all over the place by Segawa.
I'm struggling to catch my breath as she points her camera at the track and field club next to me.
Natsuki
「Hey, are you feeling better already? Help me if you are.」

％Ｂ
「Hahh... hahh... You're a real demon, Segawa...!」
Natsuki
「What the heck. I'm letting you take a break, aren't I? What am I going to do with you... How about I get you feeling better with some conversation?」

％Ｂ
「...Don't go too hard on me, please.」
Natsuki
「It's been what... two weeks since you transferred here? You about used to this school yet?」

％Ｂ
「Pretty much. I do a lot with the event committee, and it's been pretty fun.」
Natsuki
「Have a girl you like yet?」
％Ｂ
「Bfh!? Cough, kaff cough! Wh-Why would you ask something like that out of nowhere!?」

Natsuki
「Oh, well isn't that reaction suspiciooous? It'll be easier for you if you just fess up.」

％Ｂ
「Easier compared to what!?」
Natsuki
「The disease known as love? And I would be the angel who soothes that pain.」

...Like an angel would take advantage of a friend who just happened to be passing by until they're about ready to pass out.

％Ｂ
「Wh-What are you taking photos of me for!? Stop it, that's embarrassing!」
Natsuki
「I just figured it'd be good material. Titled "Transfer Student Love" or something?」

％Ｂ
「Wh-What the heck!? I don't want that kinda attention!」
Natsuki
「Don't be that way. Now let's unbutton that shirt, shall we?」
％Ｂ
「Don't take photos you wouldn't be able to put in the grad-album! And no one's gonna want photos of a guy like that!」

Natsuki
「I dunnooo, there might be some demand. You seem to have a fan club, after all.」

％Ｂ
「...Wha?」
S-Seriously...!?
Having a fan club is every guy's dream!
Did my brand as a transfer student add a bit mysterious allure, and...!?
Natsuki
「Sorry. That was a lie.」
％Ｂ
「Give it back! Give me my first heart throb of the day back! And you let it slip way too quick! You should at least build it up more before you drop the truth!」


Natsuki
「You should be grateful I provided you with that heart throb at all.」
％Ｂ
「Dammit, that was a waste of energy... I don't feel motivated anymore...」

Natsuki
「The fan club was a joke, but it's true that there are girls who talk about you, you know.」

％Ｂ
「...How so?」
Natsuki
「...Well aren't you full of energy now? I kinda wanna see your genuine expression after you've just finished a 10,000-meter dash.」

So what she's saying is that she wants to watch me die.
Also, go have someone in the track and field club do that, not me.
Natsuki
「Because you've been going around doing lots of things with the committee as soon as you transferred in, so I guess that's getting people to talk about you? Oh, and also about how you get along with Touko.」


％Ｂ
「...Get along, they say.」
Natsuki
「You're trying to recruit Touko to the event committee, right? How's that going?」

％Ｂ
「It's even harder than I thought it was gonna be. I was killing time before going to try to recruit her again today, and that's when you showed up.」

Natsuki
「...Didn't you say earlier that you had work after this?」
％Ｂ
「Th-This is work too! It's to solve Yukimura's club problem and to advertise the event committee! Two birds, one stone!」


Natsuki
「Advertise the event committee? What the heck?」
％Ｂ
「We don't have many people right now. Shuuichi said we might get people joining the committee if Yukimura joined.」

Natsuki
「Ah, I see. Yeah, it does seem like there's a lot of people who wanna get closer with her.」


％Ｂ
「...Are there really?」
Natsuki
「Well yeah, she's so pretty and she stands out. Things seem to have settled down for now, but I hear a lot of people have tried going for her and failed.」


％Ｂ
「Shuuichi was talking about that too. I guess she really is famous.」
Natsuki
「Still... that sounds exactly like something Nirasawa would think of. Is Touko just a show panda to him or something?」

％Ｂ
「That's not what I meant... I just want Yukimura to have the chance to make some good memories.」

Natsuki
「I think that's fine. I like stuff like that. As a member of the grad-alb committee, I'm super for promoting good times.」

％Ｂ
「But the thing is... Yukimura's more stubborn than I expected.」
Natsuki
「What are you moaning about it for? Push, push, and keep on pushing! Women are weak against forceful men!」

％Ｂ
「...I feel like pushing and being forceful are two different things.」
Natsuki
「That way of thinking's exactly why people say men these days are too passive! Don't make me force-feed you hay tomorrow, you herbivore!」

...I've never been called passive before, though.
I'm fine with being fed stuff, but does it have to be hay?
Natsuki
「Fine, then I'll help you out too! You let me know if anything goes wrong!」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, I might take you up on that. I can't come up with any good ideas on my own.」

Natsuki
「Hmhmh! Leeeave it to me! With someone like me who knows everything there is to know about every student in this school, you have nothing to fear!」


％Ｂ
「...I wonder what this indescribable sense of anxiety is.」
Segawa's full of confidence, while I'm full of doubt.
This'll be okay... right?
all
％Ｂ
「...Aah?」
【Touko】「Here now.」
...That's a short response.
...You're not telling me it took her almost thirty minutes just to type out those two words, right?

％Ｂ
「Fuaahh...gh, almost fell asleep...」
I crick my neck and shake away my sleepiness as I stand up.
I still feel a little lethargic, but I should get over there before it gets too late.

％Ｂ
「Yukimura, I'm coming iiin.」
Touko
「Mmm... Welcooome.」
％Ｂ
「Hm? You sending mail?」
Touko
「Mmm... Just tappiiing. This stuff's pretty hard. It took me forever to send that earlier. But isn't it amazing that I responded?」


So she really did take that long to type up that message.
I can't tell if I should praise her or roll my eyes at this point.
Touko
「Hey, what's with that face? It's your fault for messaging me when you know I'm bad at it.」

％Ｂ
「...It's my fault? You could've just called me if typing out mail was that much work for you.」

Touko
「Oh, that's true. Yeah, you're right. Maybe I'll do that from now on.」

％Ｂ
「You should get to the point where you can write mail too, you know. You can send me anything, I don't care.」

Touko
「Mm, if I feel like it. Oh, right! I was watching you act as Camera-chan's assistant.」

％Ｂ
「Huh?」
Touko
「You two both seemed like you were having fun.」
％Ｂ
「That was so rough... Segawa didn't let me leave until she was satisfied.」

Touko
「I didn't wanna get in the way of your date. Though you and Flower-chan dragged me along on your date the other day.」


％Ｂ
「Date? ...You know that was just Segawa dragging me around against my own will, right?」

Touko
「Huh, so you're into that kinda stuff?」
％Ｂ
「No! I'm a victim here! It has nothing to do with my tastes!」
Touko
「Oh, okay. So those tastes are going to bloom in the future. My, I'm excited.」
She's just nodding on her own.
Dammit, Segawa! You're only making things worse for me!
Touko
「Why don't you take photos? I don't really get it, but boys are interested in that kinda thing, right?」

％Ｂ
「It's not like I'm not interested at all... but I like looking at photos more than taking them.」

Touko
「Looking at photos? Why?」
％Ｂ
「I told you before, didn't I? I think it's fun to look back on fun memories.」

all
I grab my phone and pull up the photo I took when we went camping.\n\r

It's one of the ones we all took together to commemorate.
％Ｂ
「See how we're all smiling? You look kinda lost, but you still look like you're having fun.」

Touko
「...So this... is the face I was making back then.」
％Ｂ
「Huh? I sent you this photo, didn't I? You haven't looked at it?」
Touko
「Because... I don't know how.」
％Ｂ
「Oh... I see. All right. I'll show you how, so watch.」

Touko
「Huh? But... You sent me that photo days ago, didn't you? Can I still see it?」

％Ｂ
「Don't worry. Here, grab your phone so I can tell you what to do.」
Touko
「I-I'm doing it!? You do it! It'd be faster that way!」

％Ｂ
「You're not gonna remember if you don't do it yourself. I don't want you to never understand or learn how to do this, you know.」

Touko
「But... I don't want to break it by accident...」
％Ｂ
「These things aren't that easy to break. You're more likely to break them just by tossing them around.」

Touko
「Mmm... I guess... Fine, I'll try it.」

％Ｂ
「Okay, let's do it, then. Tap here first...」

all
％Ｂ
「And then you just tap this "Save" button here. Well? Got it?」

Touko
「...K-Kinda...?」
％Ｂ
「All right, then let's get to the application and review. Let's see... Just take a random photo and try sending it to me.」

Touko
「I can't fit any more in my head... Can't we do this some other time?」
％Ｂ
「No. You're gonna forget if you don't try repeating it while you still remember, right? It's easy. Just try it.」

Touko
「...It might be easy for you, but it's hard for me... You're asking way too much of me, geez...」

She starts up her phone camera while she grumbles.
Looks like she's at least willing to do as I say.
Touko
「Um... Like this? I can see the classroom.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. You can take a photo by just tapping the screen.」
Touko
「Mmm... Tap!」
％Ｂ
「All right, start up LIME next. Try sending me that photo.」

Touko
「Let's see... Touch this... and then send the photo... Was it this one...?」

She frowns as she manipulates her phone.
I decide to just quietly watch her until she asks me for help.
Touko
「Is this good...? Oh, it says "Send." Touch that...」
％Ｂ
「All right, it's all good. I've gotten your photo of the floor.」
Touko
「Wow! I did it! It's easier than I thought.」
％Ｂ
「Right? It's not hard once you try it. You should try messing around with other stuff too.」

Touko
「...It'd be scary if I changed something, though. I've been fine with it as is up until now, so I don't need to change anything.」

％Ｂ
「Don't worry about that. We can always reset everything to the default settings as a last resort.」

Touko
「...I see. I get it.」
％Ｂ
「Hm? Something up?」
Touko
「No, nothing. I think I'll try it again to test. Tap!」

％Ｂ
「Agh, you took a photo of me just now, didn't you!? That's not fair!」
Touko
「And next send, send... Okay, sent it.」
Touko
「Ahahah! What do you think? I think it came out pretty nicely!」
％Ｂ
「Delete that! You've figured out how to send photos, so stop taking weird ones!」

Touko
「Whaaat? I don't wanna! I took this one on my own.」
％Ｂ
「If you're gonna take a photo, then tell me first! If you're not gonna delete it, then at least do it over!」

Touko
「Oh. The battery ran out.」
％Ｂ
「What!? Didn't I tell you to make it a habit to charge your phone!?」
Touko
「Like it's that easy. I've been just kinda doing it every now and then until now.」

Dammit, that timing's just way too perfect!
Her smartphone's just as whimsical as she is!
Touko
「Now then, I don't want to learn any more than this today. And my battery just ran out too, so that's it for todaaay.」

％Ｂ
「Ugh, you better delete it later, all right?」
Touko
「If I feel like iiit. Anyway, I think it's about time to go home. Why don't you go home too?」

％Ｂ
「Wha!? It's already that late!?」
all
Now that I think about it, Segawa dragged me around for a while, and then I waited over thirty minutes for Yukimura to respond.

And then I got here and held a smartphone seminar for Yukimura... Of course it's already this late.

％Ｂ
「...What the heck did I even come here for?」
Touko
「Now, now. Days like these happen. Don't get so down.」
％Ｂ
「...Thank you so very much for your support.」
all
％Ｂ
「Sigh... I'm tired in a lot of ways today.」
I collapse onto my bed.
I've been abused both body and soul...
％Ｂ
「...Hm?」
【Natsuki】「Here's your reward. Be #ngrateful!」
％Ｂ
「Wha? Be grateful...?」
【Natsuki】_st_0501
__photo_tk0613_01
％Ｂ
「Gh!? Wh-Why!?」
She sent me an image.
A nicely taken photo of Yukimura.

Natsuki
『Yeees, how was it? That's a rare one, you know. It's hard to get Touko on camera.』

％Ｂ
「Wh-Why'd you send me something like that!? I never said...!」
Natsuki
『Because you like Touko, don't you? Just look at how you're chasing her around. I won't let you tell me otherwise at this point.』


％Ｂ
「Gh...!」
Natsuki
『Now, now! You don't have to hide it! It isn't shameful. So what part of her made you fall for her?』


％Ｂ
「...I dunno. Do I like Yukimura...?」
Natsuki
『Wha...? What are you talking about?』
％Ｂ
「I really do think about her a lot. I want her to join the event committee and expand her social circle that way. But if you asked me if that's really because I "like" her... I don't really know.」


Natsuki
『What do you mean you don't know... It's either you like her or you don't. You don't have to think about it that hard.』

If I had to say which it is between I like her or I don't... I like her.
But I feel like it's something more special... It's more like I want to do "something" for Yukimura.

Natsuki
『You know how I'm always taking photos, right? After a while of that, I just kinda... can tell how people feel just from their expressions.』


％Ｂ
「Huh?」
Natsuki
『You're always looking at Touko. And you got weirdly flustered and tried to hide it when I asked about it today. It's so obvious.』


％Ｂ
「...Am I that easy to read?」
Natsuki
『Really easy. Your face when you look at Touko's the same as the "I like you" faces I've seen before.』

％Ｂ
「...」
Natsuki
『I think Touko's probably realized how you feel about her too. I had you help me with my photography today, right? She was watching you the whole time from far away.』


...So Segawa knew too.
I guess I was the only one who didn't notice...
Natsuki
『Do your best! You can always come to me for advice.』
％Ｂ
「...Mm. I'll do that.」
Natsuki
『Ahahah! It's good to be honest! Okay then, night!』

_smh_st_04
$$smh_OpenCHK
Now there's a newly named warm emotion in my heart.
I shouldn't just let this sit in my chest forever.
I need to tell Yukimura properly.
％Ｂ
「...But how?」
Do I just tell her upfront that I like her?
Should I try to be subtle and get her to figure it out from the mood?
It's Yukimura we're talking about. She'd just change the subject and escape.
There's no way being indirect about it would work.
I guess I'll need to get creative no matter what...
％Ｂ
「I've got the event committee recruitment already... What am I making things even more complicated for?」

I guess I'll be thinking a lot about stuff tonight.
...Thank god tomorrow's Saturday.
