Today's Misa-senpai's birthday...
It's a bright, sunny day. It's almost like the weather's trying to imitate her dazzling personality.
％Ｂ
「Senpaaai.」
Misa
「Oh... H-Hello!」
She's waiting at the meet-up spot.
Her expression's a little stiff.
I feel like I don't get to see her like this too often.
Misa
「Hahhh... U-Umm...」
％Ｂ
「What are you looking so nervous for?」
Misa
「U-Um, please, if you could wait just one moment.」
all
She walks over to an alcove.
There's a store window there, which she uses to look at her reflection.
Misa
「Hair, okay... Outfit, okay... These shoes are good for walking, and I've prepared for sweat too...」
％Ｂ
「What's wrong?」
Misa
「Hyaaaaaahhh!?」
Misa
「N-Nothing at all... E-Ehehe...」
Misa
「I was just, umm, checking on my personal appearance...」
％Ｂ
「I don't see anything weird.」
Misa
「That will not do! Because, well, it's our first date. I must check and double check...」

％Ｂ
「You're very serious. You don't need to worry, though.」
Misa
「But...」
％Ｂ
「Because, um... You're cute. Just like usual... No, even more than usual.」

Misa
「Oh...」
Misa
「Eheheh... That does, well... That does make me happy.」
She smiles bashfully.
She's way cuter than usual.
％Ｂ
「So anyway, I'd like to celebrate your birthday today!」
Misa
「Y-Yes! I am very much ready to be celebrated!」
％Ｂ
「That sounds very promising.」
Misa
「I've also done my research!」
％Ｂ
「...Research?」
What on earth...?
％Ｂ
「Anyway, should we start with lunch? I'm sorry, it's going to have to be a family restaurant...」

Misa
「No need to apologize at all! I'm... looking forward to the family restaurant.」

％Ｂ
「This way, then. I'll lead the way.」
all
I point toward the corner and start walking.
％Ｂ
「...Hm? Senpai?」
But Misa-senpai doesn't start walking.
She's looking up at me expectantly.
％Ｂ
「Uhh...」
She's waiting for something...
What's going on? ...Let's see...
She's fidgeting with her fingers...
％Ｂ
「...Shall we hold hands?」
Misa
「Yes!」
She perks up brightly and nods.
Misa
「It-It's a date... so I would like to...」
％Ｂ
「Then... Here.」
Misa
「Y-Yes!」
I hold out my hand.
She holds it tight.
...With two hands.
％Ｂ
「Uhh, you're going to hold it with both hands?」
Misa
「What? O-Oh!?」
％Ｂ
「We can't walk this way, you know.」
Misa
「Y-You're right... What am I doing...?」
％Ｂ
「Here, you can just hold it with one hand.」
Misa
「Yes! ...L-Like this?」
％Ｂ
「We're shaking hands now.」
Misa
「A-Ahhh!?」
％Ｂ
「Uhh, come here to my right... no, to my left. Let's hold hands like that.」

Misa
「O-Okay...」
She hesitantly moves to my left.
％Ｂ
「Here you go, then.」
Misa
「L-Let's try...!」
She holds my hand once she's right next to me.
Misa
「...I did it.」
％Ｂ
「Yes, perfectly. You're a very quick learner, Misa-senpai.」
Misa
「O-Oh please, you flatter me... E-Ehehehe...」
Misa
「Oh, but why the left side?」
％Ｂ
「As in...?」
Misa
「You said right at first, and then changed it to the left...」
％Ｂ
「That's because, well... because cars would be passing on my right. So I thought you might be safer on the left side...」

Misa
「What? ...You're going to sacrifice yourself for my sake!?」
％Ｂ
「It-It isn't that big of a... I mean, yes, that's what it means, but...」
Misa
「You may get hurt! What if something happens!?」
％Ｂ
「Don't worry. It'll be okay. This is pretty much just common courtesy.」

％Ｂ
「I'm not going to get run over. Completely healthy.」
Misa
「...Are you sure?」
％Ｂ
「I don't have the time to be hurt when I've got such a cute girlfriend.」
Misa
「Oh...」
Misa
「E-Ehehehe... I'll be healthy too...」
Misa
「I'll live until I'm a hundred years old, okay?」
％Ｂ
「W-Well, that's quite the lofty goal.」
Misa
「Because I'd like to be with you forever.」
％Ｂ
「I guess I'll have to live until 99, then.」
Misa
「Let's both do our best!」
％Ｂ
「Hahahaha, let's. Let's get going, then.」
Misa
「Yes!」
What kinda conversation is this?
But... it's fun.
Misa
「Hahh...」
Misa-senpai's studying the menu intently.
She's been flipping pages back and forth constantly this whole time, apparently unable to decide.

％Ｂ
「Do you know what you're going to get?」
Misa
「Oh, n-no... I'm sorry, I'm a little unsure...」

Misa
「I don't have much experience in these kinds of restaurants...」

％Ｂ
「Oh no, it's fine. Please take your time.」
She's a real-deal sheltered princess, after all.
I bet she's barely even come to a family restaurant before.
Misa
「Excuse me, do you know what this "Milanese" means?」

％Ｂ
「I... don't know. I hear it's kind of Italian...」
Misa
「Could they not just call it Italian style?」
％Ｂ
「I think they just want it to be classy.」
Misa
「I see... This Japanese-style napolitan is curious too... Is it from Japan, or is it from Naples? ...And it seems to come with miso soup...」


％Ｂ
「If you eat it, maybe you'll find out.」
Misa
「Hehe... That's true. I will have the Japanese-style napolitan, then.」

％Ｂ
「I'll go with the Milanese ground beef steak, then. You can order by pressing the button there.」

Misa
「Th-This button...? It looks like some manner of self-destruct switch...」
Misa
「Hyah!? U-Umm... What is...?」

％Ｂ
「Don't worry. They'll come to take our order now.」
Misa
「I-I see! How very efficient!」
％Ｂ
「Should we get drinks too? This place has great black tea. They apparently use loose tea leaves or something.」

Misa
「How wonderful!」
all
Misa
「Wow～ It looks delicious...」
Our food arrives after a little while.
We've gotten tea too. It's time for a fun lunch.
％Ｂ
「Let's dig in, then.」
Misa
「Yes, let's!」
％Ｂ
「Oh, this Milanese ground beef steak's good. The tomato goes really well with the cheese.」

Misa
「...」
％Ｂ
「I can smell the dashi from your Japanese-style napolitan too.」
Misa
「...」
％Ｂ
「Umm... Are you not going to eat?」
Misa
「...」
％Ｂ
「...Do you need to wait for it to cool down?」
No, that's not true.
She was drinking her piping hot tea just a few minutes ago.
Those eyes of hers are expecting something.
And if she's expecting something in this situation...
％Ｂ
「U-Uhh...」
I put down my knife.
I hesitantly wrap some of her pasta around my fork, and bring it up to her mouth.
％Ｂ
「S-Say "ahh"...?」
Misa
「Yes!」
She perks up brightly and nods.
％Ｂ
「So you wanted me to feed you?」
Misa
「W-Well... we're on a date, so...」
％Ｂ
「Th-Then... Here you go.」
Misa
「Y-Yes... Thank you for the food...」
Misa
「Amh... nmh... It's delicious!」

A radiant smile appears on her face.
That was a little embarrassing, but I forget all about that when I see her smile.

％Ｂ
「But I didn't know you could act this way, Misa-senpai. You wanted to hold hands, and then wanted me to feed you...」

Misa
「Oh, it-it would be because... I want to do these things too, of course, but...」

Misa
「These are the results of my research.」
％Ｂ
「What? Research?」
Misa
「Yes. On dates you must hold hands and have them escort you...」
Misa
「And you go "ahh" when eating... and it's all the better if it's done with frankfurters or chocolate bananas...」


％Ｂ
「...Um, Misa-senpai. Where did you learn this information?」
Misa
「A very popular teen magazine called Gal's Knuckle!」
％Ｂ
「Ah...」
That's... the magazine that's had a crazy phoenix-like revival in its popularity recently.
Misa
「Because you were... very happy when we did something similar back on Urashima Island... and I was happy too...」


％Ｂ
「That's true...」
Misa
「Th-Then... I will "ahh" you back now, as thanks.」

％Ｂ
「I-Is that how it works?」
Misa
「That is exactly how it works!」
"Ahh" from a girl...
It's embarrassing...
But... not unwelcome.
％Ｂ
「Then please.」
Misa
「Y-Yes! ...Like this, and this...」
She skillfully wraps the pasta around her fork.
The disparity between that and her being flustered is kinda funny.
Misa
「S-Say "ahh"...」
％Ｂ
「Amh, hamh... Ngh.」
％Ｂ
「It's good! It's delicious!」
Misa
「Ufufu... I'm very glad.」
％Ｂ
「Then have some of this Milanese ground beef steak too. "Ahh."」
Misa
「Ahhh...」
Misa
「Nmh, nmh... Nnh...」
％Ｂ
「Oh, I'm sorry. I got the sauce on the corner of your mouth...」
Misa
「...Oh...」
I wipe the sauce away with my finger on reflex.
Which means our faces are right up against each other.
Misa
「Hauh...」
％Ｂ
「S-Senpai...」
Her pale pink lips are right before my eyes.
I can't look away.
There's no way people aren't already thinking we're just some cringey couple at this point. So...

I slowly draw closer.
Misa
「N-No... We can't.」
％Ｂ
「Oh...」
Misa
「Going that far is... a bit embarrassing.」
％Ｂ
「Y-Yes, you're right... I got a little ahead of myself.」
Misa
「...Hahh...」
％Ｂ
「I'm sorry, I was...」
Misa
「O-Oh, no.. Um... There's no need to apologize. I appreciate your feelings, but I can't help but be embarrassed with so many people here...」


Misa
「If it were somewhere with fewer people, then... I-I'd like you to do it lots...」

％Ｂ
「Misa-senpai...」
Misa
「U-Ufufufufu... Sh-Shall we finish eating?」
％Ｂ
「Y-Yes, let's do that...」
I look down and eat my lunch.
I can't really tell how it tastes anymore.
％Ｂ
「Oh, r-right. Where... do you want to go next?」
We discussed a bunch of stuff over LIME, but we didn't end up deciding on anything.

Misa
「Yes, I'm sorry about that. You came up with so many suggestions... but I couldn't choose from them, since they all seemed so fun...」


％Ｂ
「Anywhere's fine. We can go wherever's most fun for you.」
Misa
「Let me think... May I say something selfish, then?」

％Ｂ
「Yes, feel free.」
Misa
「Ufu... Then...」
Misa
「I would like to see the ocean!」
Misa
「Wooow! It's so, so pretty!」
Misa
「Shionagi's ocean is just sooo wonderful!」
％Ｂ
「Hahaha, it really is.」
％Ｂ
「You're a hardcore ocean fan for wanting to go to the ocean even now.」
Misa
「I can't help it. I like it.」
Misa
「And...」
She comes closer.
Misa
「There are two things that I like here, so they synergize and make it even more fun.」

％Ｂ
「And those would be?」
Misa
「One is the ocean, of course.」
％Ｂ
「And the other?」
Misa
「I shouldn't have to say it... It's you, Ryousuke-san!」
Misa
「I shouldn't have to say it... It's you!」
She sounds a little bashful, but she says it clearly.
％Ｂ
「I feel the same way.」
％Ｂ
「I love the ocean now thanks to you... and even more than that, I love you.」

Misa
「We're both the same, then.」
％Ｂ
「Yes, we are.」
Misa
「Ahahahahahaha!」
％Ｂ
「Hahahahahaha!」
We hold hands and spin each other around without even thinking.
Her hair floats as she spins.
It's kinda fun to watch.
％Ｂ
「We must look like kids doing this.」
Misa
「I think it's fine. It's fun.」
％Ｂ
「It's certainly good exercise. Though I'm getting a little hot...」

Misa
「Yes, it's the middle of summer. I'm wearing a hat, so I'm fine, but...」


％Ｂ
「Want to get something cold to eat, then? Look, over there.」
Misa
「Ice... crin?」
％Ｂ
「No, you don't have to say it like that.」
％Ｂ
「It's old fashioned ice cream. Ice crin. It's really good. Let's get some.」

Misa
「May I!?」
％Ｂ
「Yes, as many as you'd like.」
all
We buy some at the stall and dig in.
It has a refreshing sweetness, different from normal ice cream.

Misa
「It's very good～」
The two of us spend time sitting on a bench, looking out at the horizon.\n\r

This is pretty nice.
％Ｂ
「Oh, a seagull.」
There's a white bird flying overhead.
It's just setting the scene even more.
Misa
「That would not be a seagull.」
％Ｂ
「Huh? Really?」
Misa
「Yes. There are no seagulls in Japan during the summer, as they are migratory birds.」

％Ｂ
「O-Oh, really...」
％Ｂ
「I didn't know you knew a lot about birds too.」
Misa
「All of nature is connected. It comes naturally when you do research on the ocean.」

％Ｂ
「I really like it when you talk about what you love.」

Misa
「D-Do you?」
％Ｂ
「It's kind of like you're shining. You're very cute.」
Misa
「O-Oh my... Cute...?」
％Ｂ
「Maybe that was a bit too embarrassing?」
Misa
「Oh, n-no... I would like you... to say more.」

％Ｂ
「Then...」
％Ｂ
「You're so cute, and pretty... I love you.」

It's weird.
It feels like it's pointless to hide how I feel when I'm with her.
I want to tell her more and more about how I really feel.
We look into each other's eyes.
％Ｂ
「Oh... You've got some of the ice crin on your lips.」
Misa
「Hauh...」
I gently wipe it away.
Her lips are right in front of me.
There's almost no one around...
And the stall owner isn't paying attention to us either.
Misa
「Nh, mh...」
And so I kiss her gently.
Misa
「Hehe... It's cold.」
％Ｂ
「You're right. Your lips felt cool.」
Misa
「I'd like it... if you warmed them up.」
％Ｂ
「Then I'll do just that.」
Misa
「Nh, mmh... Mlh... Nh, chu, pfh...」
Misa
「Aha...」
Misa
「Feeling them slowly get warmer is nice.」
Misa
「Mmchu, slrp...」
Misa
「Ufufufufu... I've had you show me lots of love...」

Misa
「Is it okay for me to be loved this much?」
％Ｂ
「Of course it is. It's your birthday. I have a present for you after this, just so you know.」

Misa
「I'm so happy!」
％Ｂ
「Though I hope you weren't expecting the sturgeon.」
Misa
「A-Ahaha... I apologize for saying something so ridiculous. I was being selfish, without realizing your intentions...」

Misa
「If it's... something with genuine emotion behind it, then anything would make me happy.」

％Ｂ
「But I'd like to grant your wishes as much as possible...」
...Huh?
I'm getting a call.
％Ｂ
「I apologize.」
Misa
「Oh no, it's okay.」
all
I look at my phone.
％Ｂ
「Oh... It-It's... It might be...」
Misa
「Who is the call from?」
％Ｂ
「Misa-senpai, this... might be some great news.」
Misa
「What?」
all
％Ｂ
「Yes, hello?」
％Ｂ
「Yes. Yes... Yes, this is ％Ａ. I called you yesterday.」
％Ｂ
「What... You found one!?」
％Ｂ
「I see... I see... Then I'll come pick it up right away! Where should I...?」

Misa
「Excuse me...」
％Ｂ
「Senpai, I did it.」
％Ｂ
「Let's go to the factory right now!」
Misa
「A factory!?」
all
％Ｂ
「Let's see, take this and do that... flip that over...」
Misa
「Fufufu...」
I'm battling with a massive piece of white fabric.
％Ｂ
「And now, if I tuck in this stuffing we got...」
all
The call was from the factory that produced the "J-BP015."
I found a photo on the internet of one with the tag visible.
And so I called the factory that was on the tag.
"If there are any left over, may I purchase one?"
...Is what I asked.
Misa
「I never thought... we could meet again.」
And it turned out... there was one left in storage.
They miraculously found one in the back of a warehouse, and sold it to me at a real bargain.

％Ｂ
「Though I was surprised when we first saw it.」
Misa
「Yes, it was all floppy. I thought perhaps the jellyfish had dried out and died.」

％Ｂ
「Well, you wouldn't expect them to store it stuffing and all...」
The factory only had the outer part of the stuffed animal.
It was a pretty horrifying sight.
％Ｂ
「But I can't believe they even gave us the cotton to stuff it with. They're very generous.」

Misa
「Yes, I'm very grateful.」
％Ｂ
「Still, this is pretty hard to do... Hup.」
I've never stuffed a stuffed animal myself before.
％Ｂ
「Take this, and sew it closed... Huh? The stuffing's sticking out...」
Misa
「Fufufu... This is fine.」
％Ｂ
「No, but...」
Misa
「It looks cute with a little cotton sticking out.」
Misa
「This is my jellyfish... The only one in the world.」
％Ｂ
「Y-You think so?」
％Ｂ
「If you say so... Then here, enjoy.」
％Ｂ
「Happy birthday, Misa-senpai.」
Misa
「Woooow...」
She hugs the stuffed jellyfish tight.
She looks ecstatic.
Misa
「I'm so happy.」
Misa
「I'm very glad I was born into this world.」
％Ｂ
「Now you're just exaggerating.」
Misa
「But that's what a birthday is, is it not?」
％Ｂ
「...That's true.」
％Ｂ
「I'm really glad you were born... That we were able to meet.」

Misa
「I... feel the same way.」
She squeezes the jellyfish tight.
A little more cotton puffs out from the seams.
Misa
「I've had many enjoyable birthdays thus far.」
Misa
「...But I've never had one quite so blissful.」
％Ｂ
「Senpai...」
％Ｂ
「But it's still not over yet, you know.」
Misa
「Really?」
％Ｂ
「There's cake too. Let's eat it together.」
Misa
「How wonderful!」
I walk over to the kitchen and take out the cake that I prepared.
％Ｂ
「I'll sing... so please blow out the candles.」
％Ｂ
「Happy birthday, Misa-senpai! Happy birthday, day, Misa-senpaaai!」

Misa
「Hehe...」
％Ｂ
「Huh? Maybe that didn't come out too great?」
Misa
「No, it resonated profoundly in my heart.」
Misa
「I'm very happy... Fhhh.」
all
It's a small, whole cake.
I cut it into slices after she blows out the candles.
％Ｂ
「Then please, enjoy...」
Misa
「Oh... I can't eat it while hugging the jellyfish, can I?」

Misa
「Mmm, but I don't want to let go. He's very cute...」

％Ｂ
「I'll feed you, then.」
Misa
「Y-Yes! ...Mmmh...」
％Ｂ
「"Ahhh"...」
Misa
「Hamh! ...Nh, mh... Oh no!」
Misa
「You got cream on my lips. That was on purpose, wasn't it...?」

％Ｂ
「You noticed?」
％Ｂ
「Don't worry though, I'll get it off.」
Misa
「Okaaay...」
I gently lift her chin.
Misa
「Mm, chu... Mlh...」
I use my tongue to lick the cream away.
Misa
「I'd like more sweet kisses...」
Misa
「Mm, slrp... Mmchu...」
We passionately trade kiss after kiss.
We look deep into each other's eyes.
Misa
「...」
Silence again.
But it isn't awkward.
In fact, it's like... I feel like I just want to be like this forever.\n\r

It's like I want to just feel her presence...
％Ｂ
「Um... Senpai.」
Misa
「Yes... What is it?」
％Ｂ
「Would it be okay... if I kissed you more?」
Misa
「Wah... What a coincidence. I was just thinking the same thing.」

Misa
「I would like you... to kiss me more.」
％Ｂ
「Misa-senpai...」
I hold her body tight.
％Ｂ
「Nh, mh...」
I seal her lips with a kiss.
I just place my lips over hers. A gentle kiss... but...
Misa
「Nh...nh... Nnh...gh... Chu... Mh...gh... Nh.. fhh... Nh...gh, nh... mlh... slrp... Chu... Mmlh...」

But she immediately parts her lips when I tap at them with my tongue.
She aggressively tangles her tongue around mine.
Misa
「Nh... fhh... lrmh... mlh... chuph... Fhh... Nh... mmph...」
I move my tongue boldly in response to her movements.

Misa
「Fhh... nh...gh... Mlph... Chu... Mmlh... nnh... fhh... Mmlh... Fuah... nh...」

Her face flushes, and she leans heavily against me.
％Ｂ
「Nh, hahh...」
Misa
「Nnh... Pf, hah...nh... Ufufu... That was a very wonderful kiss.」

I hug her tight as she smiles at me.
％Ｂ
「Senpai, um...」
Misa
「Yes...?」
％Ｂ
「I'd like... to continue where we left off before.」
Misa
「Oh... Ufufufu... We're the same there too.」
Misa
「I... was also thinking the same thing.」
％Ｂ
「Misa-senpai...」
all
Before I know it, I'm holding her close, and rubbing her all over.
My right hand's on her boobs, and my left hand's below her waist... rubbing her butt.

Misa
「Nnh... hahh... nngh... Ufufu... Getting rubbed like that... feels nice...」

Misa
「It's comfortable... It puts me at ease...」
Her sighs slowly become rougher breaths.
A sweeter tone begins to mix into her exhalations.
％Ｂ
「Senpai... I love you.」
Misa
「I love you too... I love you sooo much.」
Misa
「...Being loved is a wonderful thing. And... it also feels good... Nh, fh...」

all
I rub her boobs a little intensely.
Misa-senpai doesn't resist at all.
In fact, she just relaxes her body further, letting me do as I please.
Misa
「Nh...gh... Fh...nh... Aah... nh...」
I massage her body through her clothes.
Misa
「Fhh... nh... Nnkh... Mhm... It feels... good... Mmph... Being touched by the person I love... just feels so good... and wonderful... It makes me happy...」


Misa
「It-It seems... I've gotten somewhat perverted. More and more... Nn, kh...」

％Ｂ
「I'd... like to see more of your perverted side...」
Misa
「Oh...」
I gently place my hand on the buttons at her breasts.
And... she still doesn't resist.
Misa
「And I... would like you to see that.」
She just whispers to me, in that tender voice...
