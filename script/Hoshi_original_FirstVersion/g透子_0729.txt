Shuuichi
「Any other clubs or committees that are behind? If there's anything you're even slightly worried about, tell me.」

Event Club Member B
「I think the sports clubs are all pretty much okay. They just need to make sure not to get too worked up.」

Shuuichi
「Yeah, a lot of them don't know when to stop... I want the committee members in charge of them to keep an eye out for that. Any others?」

Event Committee Member A
「Oh, the drama club might be a bit on the edge. They were saying they were having a hard time constructing the scenery.」

Shuuichi
「Let's try adjusting their schedule for bringing stuff into the gym. Could you get some more specifics on their progress? I'll look things over again too.」


The subject matter being discussed really brings home the fact that we're moving into the final stages of preparations.
We're all listening intently to Shuuichi talk.
Shuuichi
「How about the old school building?」
％Ｂ
「Let me think... They might be a bit behind in general. Though there's nothing we can do about that with the number of people we have.」

Shuuichi
「Support them as much as you can. We can reallocate some people if it's necessary, so check on their progress and report back to me.」

％Ｂ
「Check on progress and report back. Got it.」
Shuuichi
「All right, we're almost at the Tanabata Festival! I'm counting on all of you!」

all
％Ｂ
「Excuse meee, I'm from the event committee.」
Female Student A
「Oh, you're by yourself for once today?」
％Ｂ
「...Touko's doing something else in the old school building.」
How many times am I gonna get asked that today?
Literally every person I've been talking to's asked me the same thing.
Female Student B
「We were just wondering because you two are always together. We thought you might've gotten into a fight.」

％Ｂ
「We're not always together, and we haven't gotten in a fight.」

Female Student A
「You're together a lot when you go out to town too, right? I heard from my friend that you and Yukimura-san were kissing in the seaside park the other day.」

％Ｂ
「Wha!? W-We weren't...!」
...Wait. We totally were.
So someone saw us...
I guess it's not surprising considering how long we were kissing for...
Female Student A
「Kissing in the park at sunset! I'm so jealous! It's a situation everyone wants to be in～!」

％Ｂ
「...This is embarrassing, so please stop.」
Female Student B
「We've heard lots of other rumors too, you know. Like how you were feeding each other sandwiches at the pool, or like how you were doing dirty stuff in the old school building!」


Female Student A
「Oh, did you two really go off into the hotel district after your date!?」

％Ｂ
「Th-The hotel district!? Wait a second, what the heck are you talking about!? Who's saying all this crap!?」

Female Student A
「Everyone knows about it. You two are famous.」
Shuuichi was saying the same thing.
I didn't really pay it that much mind back then, but it's definitely concerning to hear the same thing from other people too.

Female Student A
「You walk around with your arm around Yukimura-san's waist when you're on dates, right? Do you two really do that kinda foreigner-couple stuff?」

％Ｂ
「We don't! We walk totally normally!」
Female Student B
「Normally how? I've seen you two feeding each other too, so I thought the arm around the waist sounded believable.」


％Ｂ
「N-Normal means normal! And the feeding thing's 'cause Touko wants to do it...!」

Female Student A
「It's hard to ask usually because Yukimura-san's always with you. Let us ask you more! Are you two really engaged!? You're living together starting next year, right!?」


...This is such a freakin' pain!
This is the fearsome might of the girls' information network!
％Ｂ
「I'm back...」
Touko
「Welcome baaack. Oh, what's wrong? You look really tired.」

％Ｂ
「...Long story.」
Touko
「Oh, right. Flower-chan messaged us. She says we should all eat lunch together again today.」

％Ｂ
「Wha, really? I didn't see that.」
Touko's in charge of lunch today.
If the others are all coming, then that means she'll be showcasing her cooking... Is this going to be okay?

Touko
「I think they should be coming soon. I'm so hungry～ I wish they'd hurry～」

％Ｂ
「...You seem excited. Even though you were so worried about eating together with the others the first time.」

Touko
「Huh? Was I? I don't really think so.」
She seems to have gained some confidence, probably from her practicing.
I can expect good things if she's like this.
all
Natsuki
「Okaaay, I'm heeere!  Wait, am I the first one here again?」

％Ｂ
「Yeah. No one else is here yet.」
Natsuki
「Fufu... I'm not the same person today as I was last time. I've actually brought a lunchbox too!」

She sticks her chest out in pride as she proclaims it.
...Is that really something to be so proud about?
Natsuki
「Touko and I are both beginners, so I think we'll put on a good fight together. Oh, and your opinion's going to be discarded because Love Power's involved.」

％Ｂ
「...The heck's Love Power?」
Natsuki
「They say cooking's all about love, right? It's not fair for you to judge a lunchbox that she made for you.」

...I'm gonna get to eat today, right?
I'm pretty hungry over here...
all
Marika
「Hellooo. Oh, Segawa-san's already here.」
Natsuki
「I'm glad you could come, examiners! It's time to fight, Touko! It's time for me to showcase my femininity!」

Misa
「Excuse me, but I am completely lost as to the subject of this conversation...?」
all
Natsuki
「Well, that's strange... It tasted good before I cooked it...」
Yeah, that would be the ingredients themselves.
What would be the point if the ingredients don't already taste good?
Marika
「A-Ahaha... I'm sure you'll get better if you practice, Segawa-san.」

Misa
「Yes. You should take your time and learn one thing at a time.」

Natsuki
「...I'm starting to get depressed. I think I might just be actually really bad at being a girl...」


Sora
「...No issue. You're a girl through and through.」
Natsuki
「Sora, you're such a good kid...! Where!? What part of me's girly!?」

Sora
「Your boobs. Your butt's big too.」
Natsuki
「...Oh. Those parts.」
all
We're having lots of fun again today.
I've already become completely used to eating lunch with everyone like this.
％Ｂ
「Oh, right. I didn't get to check this morning, but how are things going for the astronomy and naturalist clubs?」

Rikka
「...It's going perfectly. Ousaka-san's work is, at least.」

Sora
「...*nod* I made documents. Ritsu helped me lots too.」
Looks like they're getting along well together.
I'll check in with them later today.
all
Misa
「As for us... We are not exactly sailing the smoothest of seas. We are having trouble with preparing the equipment.」

Marika
「There's only a week left until the festival... We'll need to do our best.」
Misa
「Perhaps we may wish to reduce the number of species somewhat... Marika-san, let's discuss this afterward.」

Marika
「Okay! We'll formulate a plan over tea!」
The naturalist club's an elegant club that has its own teatime.
I guess it makes sense with Okihara-senpai as the president...
％Ｂ
「I need to report back to Shuuichi about your progress. What would you like to do? He said he'd be willing to reallocate some people if any clubs need help.」

all
Misa
「Let me see... We would like some help carrying the equipment in. There are many heavy things.」

％Ｂ
「When are you scheduled to bring your things in again?」
Misa
「In three days. We must complete our preparations for the room by then.」

％Ｂ
「I understand. I'll let Shuuichi know and get some people to help you.」

Touko
「...」
all
％Ｂ
「Touko? Something up?」
Touko
「Oh, no... I was just thinking about something.」
％Ｂ
「Thinking? About...?」
all
Misa
「Oh, it appears lunch break is already over. Marika-san, let us return to our work.」

Marika
「Yes. Let's eat lunch together again, okay?」
％Ｂ
「Sure. Come on over anytime.」
all
Sora
「...Ritsu. Let's hurry back. We have to make lots of decorations.」

Rikka
「I-I know, don't pull me! We don't have to hurry that much!」

all
％Ｂ
「What's wrong? You barely said anything that whole time.」
Touko
「Earlier, while everyone was talking about stuff... I was thinking. About how I need to tell them that I'm moving.」


％Ｂ
「Wha...?」
Touko
「But... they looked like they were having so much fun. I didn't want to get in the way of that... so I couldn't really say it.」


So that's what was on her mind...
I can see how it might be difficult to bring that up when everyone's having a good time.
％Ｂ
「Yeah, we always get pretty rowdy when we're together. Maybe I should talk to them about it a bit first and...」

Touko
「No, you don't need to. I can do it myself... so wait just a little longer.」

％Ｂ
「...Okay. I'll always be on your side, so just let me know if you need help.」

Touko
「...Okay. Thanks. I'll do my best.」
all
％Ｂ
「Sigh... I'm finally done...」
This all took longer than I expected.
All of the clubs seem to have started to get really busy, and their task management's gotten sloppier as a result.

Fixing all that's been a lot of work.
％Ｂ
「I bet Touko's sick of waiting over there.」
【％Ｂ】「Heading back over now. #NGet ready to go home.」
％Ｂ
「Sorry I'm late, Tou... Huh?」
Touko
「Zzz... Zzz...」
％Ｂ
「...Guess I can't blame her. We've been busy lately, and she made lunch today.」

I haven't seen this in a while.
I remember back when I used to see Touko sleeping on her own like this pretty often.
I look at her face, bathed in the colors of the setting sun.
She looks prettier than she did before... I wonder if Touko changed, or if my heart did.

I gently stroke her hair.
I smile as her soft, fine hair slips through my fingers.

Touko
「Nnh... nnnh...?」
％Ｂ
「Oh, my bad... I woke you up.」
Touko
「...More.」
％Ｂ
「Huh?」
Touko
「Pet me mooore...? Your hand feels nice...」
％Ｂ
「Sure. Like this?」
Touko
「Mm... Ehehe, yeah. Like thaaat...」
There's a stack of paperwork on a nearby desk.
I glance over at it. It's all been neatly taken care of.
％Ｂ
「You finished all your work. Good job, Touko.」
Touko
「Mhm... I tried my beeest... I can do my work even if it's just meee...」

％Ｂ
「...」
Her saying "even if it's just me"... makes my heart twinge in pain.
There's only a week until the Tanabata Festival.
What's Touko's answer going to be?
Time passes slowly in the old school building.
But it never stops.
It's... impossible for our relationship to continue like this.
But I still...
Touko
「...What's wrooong...? Your hand's stooopped...」
％Ｂ
「R-Right... Sorry.」
For now... I want to enjoy this wonderful mood for a while longer.
I continue stroking her hair.
％Ｂ
「Come on, Touko! Lock up!」
Touko
「Nnh... You can do iiit... Counting on yooou...」
...She's still half asleep.
Man, I'm terrible at using this key though...
all
％Ｂ
「Hup... Kh, you piece of...! Why the hell... won't you... turn...!?」

Touko
「Ahaha, you're so bad at it! You need to stick it in hard and deep.」

...Those words are painfully suggestive for guys.
You do it if you're awake...
all
％Ｂ
「All right, it turned! Hmhmh! How about that!」
Touko
「...Why are you bragging to me? I'll show you how it's done tomorrow.」

％Ｂ
「How it's...? Oh, right. I got asked a ton of stuff when I was doing stuff on my own today. I heard "Where's Yukimura-san?" pretty much everywhere I went.」


Touko
「Huh? Why?」
％Ｂ
「Remember how Shuuichi said we're famous? I guess we really are.」

Touko
「...Oh yeah, back when you were almost branded a pervert.」
...I didn't want to remember that.
I haven't heard any rumors about that since then, so I think I'm fine on that front. But I'm still wary with how exaggerated the stuff I heard today was.

Touko
「I don't think you need to mind it. It's not like we're doing anything bad, so why not just ignore it? Rumors disappear eventually.」


％Ｂ
「Well... If you say so.」
Touko
「Yep, yep. Don't worry about it. I want you to worry about lunch tomorrow instead.」

％Ｂ
「I guess I'll make tomorrow's. You probably don't wanna make lunch every day, right?」
Touko
「Mmm... Yeah. I wanna take my time and relax while eating again too.」
％Ｂ
「Got it. Let's go home, then.」
Touko
「Mhm. Goodbye, see you tomorrow.」
She bows her head to the soon-to-be-torn-down old school building.
It's an important place for her.
all
I follow Touko's lead and also bow my head.
We'll be in your care for just a little bit longer.
