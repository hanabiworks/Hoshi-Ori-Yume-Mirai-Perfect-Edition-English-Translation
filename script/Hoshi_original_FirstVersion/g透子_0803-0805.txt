Marika
「Hellooo. Naturalist club heeere.」
％Ｂ
「Aah?」

Misa
「Oh, it seems you are in the middle of eating. We have brought what you asked us for...」

％Ｂ
「Ahhh! Th-Thank you very much!」
Crap! Touko's gonna find out!
I stand up and sprint to the door and hurriedly push Shinozaki and Okihara-senpai out into the hallway.

％Ｂ
「You can't do this! Touko doesn't know about all of this!」

Marika
「I-I'm sorry! We thought we could bring it to you because you seemed busy...」

Misa
「Then please allow us to hand ours to you now. Here you go.」
I take them and carefully stow them in my pocket.\n \n\r

...They aren't gonna crumple, right?
Marika
「Sorry for bothering you while you were eating.」
％Ｂ
「It's fine. Thanks. Only a little more to do now, so I'll do my best.」
Misa
「We will be excusing ourselves, then. I am very much looking forward to the Tanabata Festival.」

Touko
「...What did they come for? It wasn't just to see how things were going over here, right?」

％Ｂ
「Oh, uh... Yeah, so I asked them to do a little something for me! It's not really a big deal or anything!」

Touko
「...Okay.」
...Looks like she isn't suspicious.
I'll have to make sure she doesn't figure anything out until it's all done.
all
I ran around throughout the school and managed to get to talk to all of the clubs.
All that's left is to see what they'll do.
％Ｂ
「...I didn't get to go back to the old school building at all today again.」
I should have a little more time tomorrow.
It depends on how much event committee work I have, of course, but I should still be able to square off some time to spend together with Touko.

％Ｂ
「This'll be over soon. So wait just a little longer.」

I'm alone here again today.
I used to like spending time like this... but now I really hate it.

Touko
「...Aw, man. What am I going to do?」
I feel more lost with every passing day... no, every passing second.
The fogginess in my chest keeps building up with nowhere to escape to. I... have no idea what direction I should be moving in.

Touko
「Hey... What do you think I should do?」
I already know the answer he'd give if I asked him that.
He'd say, "I'd like you no matter what your answer is"... He'd smile his kind smile and pet me on the head.

Touko
「He's just so good at troubling me.」
Now that I think about it, it's all he's been doing ever since we first met.
And on top of that, he likes seeing me get like this... What a mess I've gotten myself into.
Touko
「...Though I understand. I like seeing him get like this too.」

I can remember every day we've spent together as if it were yesterday.
This summer in Shionagi... has been a really special summer for me.
I couldn't forget it even if I wanted to.
And... that's why this is so painful for me.
If I think about the fun things... then I can forget my worries, just for a bit.

But time never stops for me.
The longer our relationship goes on... the deeper it'll gouge into my heart.
I'm getting sick of how weak I am.
I really want to cling to him as hard as I can... but I hesitate when I imagine what lies ahead. There's something in my heart holding me back.

I'm a coward, so I want to run away by ending it.
Touko
「And in the end... I still haven't been able to say it.」
I just can't say those three words. "I love you."
I can't say it... not even as a joke.
I won't be able to stop myself if I do say it.
I've decided in my heart... that it's the one line that I just can't cross.
Touko
「...Two more days.」
There are two more days until the day of our promise.
I'm... going to have to wake up from my dream soon.
Once I wake up, I'll be alone.
I'll start walking to find a place for myself again.
Will I do it while still shouldering these feelings...?
All these feelings I couldn't possibly bear myself, all by myself...?
I wonder if I'll really be able to do it...
Touko's been on my mind for a while now.
I'll send her a message.
【％Ｂ】「Sorry to leave you #Nalone all day. You #Ndoing okay?」
I'll stop by the old school building if she doesn't respond.
I should probably at least check on how she's doing.
【Touko】_st_0301
【Touko】「Hard at work.」
【Touko】_st_0307
Hmm... Is she really okay?
It's kinda hard to tell just over text. I should call her so I can hear her voice.
_smh_st_01
_smh_st_btn01
_SMH_ST_01
.........
......
...
％Ｂ
「...Huh. She's not picking up.」
But she responded on LIME...
Maybe she walked away from her phone?
％Ｂ
「She should've gotten the notification that I called, so maybe she'll call me back later.」
_smh_st_04
I guess I'll just make sure I don't miss her call while I work.
I'll plan things out so I can go to the old school building at some point today.
％Ｂ
「I'm from the event committee! How are things going over here?」
％Ｂ
「Hahh... hahh... I have a little time... so I came to check on how things were going...!」
Touko
「Oh, welcome back... Wow, you're covered in sweat.」
'Cause I ran back here, yeah.
It's the only way I was able to make the time to come by.
％Ｂ
「I was a bit worried... 'cause you didn't pick up when I called.」
Touko
「Oh, sorry about that. I had some work to do after your message... so I couldn't answer.」

％Ｂ
「Oh, okay. Sorry to leave all that to you.」
Touko
「No, it's okay. I need to practice while I still can.」
％Ｂ
「...Practice? Practice for what?」
Touko
「It's a secreeet. I'm never telling yooou.」
％Ｂ
「What!? Wh-Why not!?」
Touko
「Because it's embarrassing. I'm not going to tell you everything, you knooow.」

What's up with her...?
She looks like she's having a lot of fun...
Touko
「I'll go buy something cold for you. You're going to keel over if you don't take a bit of a break.」

all
％Ｂ
「Oh...」
...And she's gone.
I'm grateful she's being thoughtful... but I came here to see her, and now I'm alone.

％Ｂ
「...Maybe I'm worrying too much.」
Touko
「Here, I bought a drink. I got you a sports drink, is that okay?」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, thanks.」
all
It feels cold and nice in my hand.
I open the bottle and drink about half of the contents in one go.
％Ｂ
「Hnh... hahh, gh...! Ahh... I feel alive again.」
Touko
「Ahaha, was it that bad? I guess it's really hot again today.」

％Ｂ
「It's really feeling like midsummer, yeah... Wish the sun would just stop it already...」

Touko
「Mmm... I don't really hate it, though. It feels more summery when it's really hot.」

％Ｂ
「Well... that's true. Wish it'd get cooler, though...」
Touko
「...Mm. Yeah.」
I regret my words immediately.
The seasons changing is synonymous with saying goodbye to Touko.
I shouldn't have said I wanted it to get cooler... That was irresponsible of me.
％Ｂ
「...Sorry. I didn't mean it like that.」
Touko
「Mm, like what? Everyone has things they want. It's totally normal to want it to get cooler when it's hot out.」


Touko
「That's more work for you, isn't it? Four-Eyes-kun's going to be mad at you if you slack off too much.」

％Ｂ
「Dammit, he's just so...! Wish he'd let me have at least a little free time!」

Touko
「It means you're just that dependable. I'll be waiting here, so why don't you go?」

％Ｂ
「Okay... I'll find the time to come by again.」
all
％Ｂ
「All right, that's all of them...! I should be able to finish everything once I collect the rest tomorrow...!」

I look through the filled-out checklist I have.
It looks like my efforts over the last few days will get to bear fruit.
％Ｂ
「I hope this makes Touko happy.」
It'll all come together with just a little more work.
I should check on how Segawa's stuff is going too.
【％Ｂ】「I think I'll be able to #Nfinish my part.」
【Natsuki】「Great job! You've done #Na lot!」
【％Ｂ】「I'm planning on #Nstarting to prepare #Nthings tomorrow night. #NThink it's doable?」
【Natsuki】_st_0204
【Natsuki】「I'll make it work.」
【％Ｂ】「Want me to help?」
【Natsuki】「You need to be with #NTouko! Isn't she #Nlonely!?」
...She's angry.
【％Ｂ】「Thanks. I'm really #Ngrateful.」

This is practice for the future.
That's what I've been considering my time alone...
But the name on the screen... is the name of the person I want to talk to most right now.
All it'll take is one tap to hear his kind, considerate voice.

...I don't have the courage.
I'm sure that if I talk to him right now... I won't be able to take it.
It's only been a few days, but I'm already so hopelessly lost.
I'm scared of touching him... of even just hearing his voice.
I want to hear him speak. I want to touch him as much as I can.
My conflicting feelings force my finger to hesitate.
Touko
「Oh...」
My phone stops ringing.
It feels like all of my connections with him were cut away with it.
...It hurts.
It feels like my heart's being crushed. Tears roll out from my eyes.

If only I could hate him... It'd make this all so much easier.
But there's so much love for him filling me up... I couldn't possibly hate him now.

I love the way he smiles and forgives me when I mess with him.
I love the way he warmly comforts me when I'm being negative.
And I love the way he always lets me cling to him as much as I want... I love it all so much.
I feel like I'm being crushed under the weight of my feelings.\n \n\r
I can't express these feelings in my heart through my words or my actions... and they become a poison, eating away at me.

Touko
「...Save me.」
I come back to the old school building to find Touko asleep.
She must've fallen asleep after waiting for so long.
Touko
「Mmh... nnh... Zzz... zzz...」
I haven't seen her sleeping like this in a while.
But something seems different from usual.
What is it...?
％Ｂ
「...」
I finally realize.
It's her expression.
She's always looked so happy sleeping, but now... she looks incredibly lonely.

％Ｂ
「I... really am making her feel lonely like this, aren't I...?」
I'll make her smile tomorrow for sure.
That's what all of my efforts have been for up until now.
％Ｂ
「Whoa, uh...!」
I hurry out into the hallway.
It's a call... from Mr. Azuma!
It might be about what I asked him for...!
_smh_st_02
_smh_st_btn02
_smh_st_02
_smh_st_btn05
％Ｂ
「Yes, this is ％Ａ!」
Azuma
『We've made it in time. When are you gonna come get it?』

％Ｂ
「Thank you very much! I'll come pick it up tonight!」

Azuma
『Let me know if you're gonna end up being late. I don't wanna work overtime because of you.』

％Ｂ
「I understand! I'll come by as soon as I can!」
_smh_st_04
Thank god, they made it in time...!
It's all starting to come together now!
Let's check in on Segawa too.
This all needs to be done tonight... I want to avoid any wasted time.

【％Ｂ】「It's all coming #Ntogether on my side. #NHow's it going for you?」
【Natsuki】「Absolutely perfect! I'm #Nready to go whenever!」
【％Ｂ】「Got it. I'll let you #Nknow once I'm ready.」
Good. Looks like things are okay on Segawa's front too.
I should go home with Touko now, so I can get started as soon as I can.
％Ｂ
「Touko, wake up. You can still catch colds in summer, you know.」
Touko
「Nn, nnh... Oh, welcome baaack...」
％Ｂ
「Sorry I'm late. You sleeping 'cause you're tired?」
Touko
「Mmm... Today was busyyy...」
She still sounds half asleep.
I'm sure she's been doing lots of work on her own too.
％Ｂ
「Come on, let's head home. We've done what we can to prepare for tomorrow, so all that's left is to just enjoy the day of.」

Touko
「Mm, yeah. I'll need to have lots of fun to make up for all the stuff I had to do to help prepare.」

％Ｂ
「I bet it'll be even more fun because of the work you put in. I'm super excited to spend the Tanabata Festival together with you too.」

Touko
「...Mhm. Me too.」
all
％Ｂ
「I'm sorry I'm late...!」
Azuma
「Oh, you're here. It's right over there. I don't think you'll have any complaints about the size or color.」

％Ｂ
「Yes, this is great! Thank you so much!」
Azuma
「We've treated it too, so it should be good for about three days. Be careful not to damage it when you carry it.」

％Ｂ
「I understand. Thank you so very much, Teacher! I swear I'll repay...」

Azuma
「Don't need it. If you just have to repay me, then come back once you actually know what you're doing. I'll take you in then.」


I'll take that as his way of offering encouragement.
His kindness is another thing that supports my relationship with Touko.
I want to communicate it all to her tomorrow.
％Ｂ
「Yes, then I'll repay the favor in a few years. I hope you'll take off the interest as a favor.」

Azuma
「Hahah, now look at you talk. I'll be looking forward to it.」
all
％Ｂ
「Sorry I'm late!」
Natsuki
「You're finally here. Look, we're all ready to go!」
Everyone's gathered around Segawa on the rooftop.
all
Even though I'm sure they've all got their own stuff to work on for the festival... I couldn't possibly be grateful enough for them.

％Ｂ
「...Thanks, everyone. I'm really glad you're all here.」
all
Marika
「We all want to do this with you. Because Yukimura-san's an important friend for us.」


Sora
「Doing this at night means I can stargaze too. Two birds, one stone. And it's more fun with everyone.」

all
Rikka
「Let's hurry and get this finished. I'm afraid of people becoming suspicious of us if we stay up here for too long.」

Misa
「There is no need to worry. Shuuichi-san and I have already received proper permission for us to be here.」

all
Shuuichi
「Yeah, we've already made the arrangements. Being well behaved has its benefits.」

Natsuki
「Wait, why'd you look at me just now...?」
Shuuichi
「I didn't really mean much by it, but I'd say you only thought it meant something because you know something about yourself.」

Natsuki
「Nnghhh...」
all
Sora
「...Ritsu. We can watch the stars all night tonight. Let's do it together.」

Rikka
「Are you planning on staying up all night...? We can't do that when the Tanabata Festival's tomorrow.」

Sora
「...! Rejected... Can't recover from this...」
Rikka
「I-I didn't say I didn't want to! There's tomorrow too. We could decide on a date...」

Sora
「When's okay for you? I'm free any day of the year.」
Rikka
「Hgh... It's so strange... I just can't say no to you when you look at me like that...」
all
Marika
「A-Ahaha... Everyone looks like they're having fun.」
Misa
「Yes, very much so! Let's contact Touko-san too so we can...!」
Marika
「W-We caaan't! We're supposed to be keeping this a secret from Yukimura-san!」

Misa
「Oh, that's right! I nearly sent the message...!」

...Are we really going to be okay?
all
％Ｂ
「...All right, I think that about does it.」
We've completed the keystone of my plan together.
All that's left is to showcase this to Touko.
Marika
「I hope Yukimura-san likes it.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. Let's get her to see exactly how we feel.」
Natsuki
「The weather's looking great for tomorrow! I've gotta get that one perfect shot!」

all
Misa
「I'm so very excited! I worry I may not be able to sleep tonight...!」

Sora
「No issues. If you can't sleep, then you can look at the stars here. The sky is really pretty at sunrise.」

We're all excited from preparing for the festival.
all
I turn toward Narusawa, who's standing outside the circle, quietly looking up at the sky.

％Ｂ
「Great work, Narusawa. Thanks for helping so late at night.」
Rikka
「You don't need to thank me or anything. I understand how Yukimura-san feels too, and... it was unexpectedly fun for me too.」


％Ｂ
「Good to hear that. Let's do our best tomorrow.」
Rikka
「I only do what I can, and once I agree to something, I'll take responsibility and see it through to the end. Don't mess up right at the end, okay?」


％Ｂ
「...Yeah. I won't.」
She really is a kind person.
I thank her in my heart one more time, and go back to my usual demeanor.

％Ｂ
「You know, I bet you'd be crazy popular with the boys if you smiled a little nicer... It's kind of a shame.」

Rikka
「Wha? Wh-What!? Wh-Why would you say something like that!?」


Natsuki
「Rikka's already really popular as she is. There's no end to the boys who just can't get enough of how cool she is. She's earned that title of "Number One Shionagi First Academy Girl a Boy Would Want to Be Stepped on By."」


Rikka
「Wh-What on earth is that disgusting title!? When did people collect a statistic like that!?」

Sora
「...But Ritsu's more scatterbrained than you'd think. She got depressed about dropping some soft-serve ice cream the other day.」

Rikka
「Ousaka-san!? I thought I told you to keep that a secret!」
Sora
「...Never said I would.」
Natsuki
「Oh my, Rikka-chan, how cute! Do you have any more stories like that, Sora?」

Sora
「Mountains.」
Rikka
「N-No, she doesn't! Ousaka-san, come with me for a second!」
Natsuki
「Marika, Misa-san! Don't let her escape!」
all
Marika
「Wh-Whaaat...!? What are we supposed to do about thiiis...!?」
Misa
「But it seems fun, like playing tag! Let's go, Marika-san!」

all
We're all noisily running around on the rooftop.
Tomorrow... I'm sure we'll be able to form another warm circle like this one.
