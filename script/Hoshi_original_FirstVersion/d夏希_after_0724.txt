Natsuki
「Fuah... afh... Morning～」
％Ｂ
「Hey. Morning, Natsuki.」
Natsuki
「You're up early today... What's going on?」
％Ｂ
「Yep. Today's the day of the competition.」
Natsuki
「Wha... That's today? Did you finish your submission?」
％Ｂ
「Of course. It turned out pretty good. I think he might even end up picking mine.」

Natsuki
「Ohh, you sure sound confident. Then did you get up early 'cause you were just that excited?」


％Ｂ
「Yeah, pretty much. I figured I'd go in early today. I made breakfast already, so you can heat that up and eat it.」

Natsuki
「Mm, thanks. Do your best. Mmm... chu♪」

％Ｂ
「Mm... I'm off, then!」
Natsuki
「Have a nice daaay♪」
My submission for the competition came out even better than I had expected.
Like I said to Natsuki, I think my design might genuinely be a candidate to win.

No! It's definitely a candidate to win!
％Ｂ
「And then Azuma-san might let me completely take over this commission... Haha, yeah right.」

But either way, I still think I can compete with my senior coworkers with this.
I'm gonna get Azuma-san to acknowledge my abilities!
Azuma
「Right, let's see what you've all brought.」
％Ｂ
「Y-Yes!」
all
It's finally time to show Azuma-san my work!
I hand him the materials I prepared after the others.
％Ｂ
「Thank you very much!」
Azuma
「Quiet down, geez...」
He casually flips through the materials he's received and places them on his desk.

Azuma
「It's going to be up to my own discretion for whose design we'll go with. After that, I'll brush up on it and propose it to the clients. Understand?」


％Ｂ
「Yes!」
Azuma
「I'll announce the results in the evening today. That's all.」
all
He immediately starts looking through the materials.
So we'll find out in the evening...
Guess I'll be on tenterhooks the whole time until then.
Hope it goes well...
Azuma
「Fuaaahhh... Afh... Ughhh, I'm exhausted. Hey, get me some coffee.」

％Ｂ
「Y-Yes!」
all
I head to the kitchen, pour some coffee, and come back.
％Ｂ
「Here you go!」
Azuma
「Mm, thanks... Slurp... Ahh. All right, I'm gonna announce the results of the competition then.」

H-Here it is...!
Azuma
「...
Hino
You
.」
％Ｂ
「Wha... D-Did my design win!?」
No way... Did I seriously...!?
Azuma
「What are you talking about? I'm gonna talk with you all one at a time, so get over here.」
％Ｂ
「Oh... Yes...」
I thought he was going to announce the results in front of everyone...
I nervously head to Azuma-san's desk and stand at attention.
I kinda feel like a student who's been told to come to the faculty office for a lecturing.

Azuma
「...I'll start with the conclusions.」
％Ｂ
「Okay.」
Azuma
「This is terrible.」
％Ｂ
「...I'm sorry?」
Azuma
「Yours is the worst one out of the three of you.」
％Ｂ
「Uh...mh...」
It takes me a moment to understand what he says because he said it so brusquely.

％Ｂ
「It's... terrible?」
Azuma
「Yeah. You just imagined the house that you two newlyweds wanna live in, didn't you?」

H-How'd he figure that out?
Azuma
「Your house is looking too far at the "future," and not at the "now."」

％Ｂ
「At... the now?」
Azuma
「Did you read the materials on the clients?」
％Ｂ
「Yes... I did...」
Azuma
「They don't have kids. And yet your design has two rooms for children. This is just going to be dead space for the clients right now.」


％Ｂ
「B-But... that may be the case now, but they should still have usable children's rooms for the future...」

Azuma
「What if they never have kids?」
％Ｂ
「I...」
Azuma
「And it's not just the children's rooms. It's the same with this ridiculously big island-style kitchen, and this excessively big bathroom. It's all too big for just two people.」


％Ｂ
「I was thinking those could be used for cooking and taking baths together once they have children...」

Azuma
「That's what I'm talking about. That's just what you yourself want.」
％Ｂ
「...」
Azuma
「Our job is to take what the clients want into account, and provide them with even more than that.」

Azuma
「Proposing things they don't even want is just being inconsiderate. What would you think if you were in their shoes? You really think you'd pay money for a design that's just catering to the designer's own preferences?」


％Ｂ
「...Gh... I wouldn't.」
Azuma
「Thinking from the client's perspective is a basic among basics. You failed to do that. You haven't changed since the day you first walked into this firm at all.」


％Ｂ
「...I-I'm very sorry...」
The first time I came to this firm, I built a model for Azuma-san to get him to acknowledge my abilities.

But I failed dismally after neglecting a key feature of the blueprint.

It's the same now.
Azuma-san's right. I really haven't learned anything since then...

％Ｂ
「...This is 100 percent a failing on my part... It must have been too soon for me to participate in this competition. I'll go back and study everything all over again from scratch.」


Azuma
「Hoh... That's an admirable attitude for once.」
all
I bow my head low to Azuma-san and start on my way back to my desk.

Azuma
「Wait a second. I'm not done yet.」
％Ｂ
「Huh...?」
Azuma
「Your submission's definitely unpolished and incomplete as a design. It's just not good. But there are some interesting parts.」

Azuma
「This atrium, for instance. You have the relationship between the central atrium and the interior windows that all face toward it.」


Azuma
「The atrium's the trunk of a huge tree, and the interior windows are the branches and leaves. You took the "sunlight through the trees" theme into account for this, didn't you?」


％Ｂ
「Y-Yes, I did... I wanted to create the image of a tree in the design, because of the theme.」

％Ｂ
「The original idea comes from when Natsuki... oh, I mean, when my wife said she would personally want to be able to see her family's faces and be within speaking distance at all times...」


Azuma
「See? There you go, you had your head in the clouds after all.」
％Ｂ
「I-I'm sorry...」
Azuma
「But still, this way of establishing the presence of empty space is pretty interesting. I wouldn't have had this idea. It's excellent.」


...What?
Wait a second, did he... praise me...?
Azuma
「This definitely isn't an idea aimed toward the clients this time around.」
Azuma
「But, yeah... I might've used this if the clients were asking for a house for a four-person family.」

％Ｂ
「Really!?」
Azuma
「Just as a sample, at least. I might wanna try proposing this design if we get a commission like that sometime.」


Azuma-san praised my design!
And on top of that, it might just be as a sample, but he says he'd propose my design...!

It's making me so happy I'm―
％Ｂ
「Oh...」
Azuma
「Hm? What's wrong?」
％Ｂ
「...Um... You proposing my design would make me very happy... but actually, please don't.」

Azuma
「Why's that?」
％Ｂ
「That design's something I came up with for the current theme of "sunlight through the trees."」

％Ｂ
「I think that if a commission for a four-person home did come up, it would be best to listen to what the family had to say, and start the design from scratch...」


Azuma
「...Hoh.」
I need to take what the clients want into account, and provide something that surpasses their expectations.

It's what Azuma-san told me maybe a minute ago, but I was about to get ahead of myself and make the same mistake again.

％Ｂ
「And so... let's say the conversation just now never happened.」
Azuma
「...Got it. If that's what you want, then it never happened.」
He pats me on the shoulder.
Azuma
「That was a pretty good answer. It's exactly what I'd expect from a disciple of mine.」

％Ｂ
「Tha...Thank you very much!」
all
％Ｂ
「So yeah, I didn't win the competition.」
Natsuki
「Oh, really... That's a shame, but oh well.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah... It just means I still have that much more to learn. Though that's obvious, of course. I'll need to keep at it...」


Natsuki
「Mhm, mhm! You can never forget to be diligent. Keep doing your best from now on!」

％Ｂ
「R-Right... Why are you acting so superior...?」
Natsuki
「But it's great that Azuma-san acknowledged you.」
％Ｂ
「Were you even listening to what I said? He completely shut me down―」

Natsuki
「He said "exactly what I'd expect from a disciple of mine," right? Doesn't that mean he's legitimately acknowledged you as a disciple of his?」

％Ｂ
「...Oh...」
Natsuki
「You've been calling him Teacher like that without his permission, but now you can do it with pride. Good for you.」

％Ｂ
「Right... You're right!」
I've genuinely become Azuma-san's disciple!
All right―
no, I can't get too happy.
I need to make sure I don't get ahead of myself and mess something up again...
