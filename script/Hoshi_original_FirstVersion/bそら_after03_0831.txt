The city's starting to calm back down after another Tanabata Festival.
At the same time, the science museum quietly closes its doors.
Sora narrated the planetarium's final show today. Preparations for construction begin tomorrow.

％Ｂ
「...Sora. Great work up until now.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
Even though she knows it's going to be reopened, she still must be sad about a place she has good memories of disappearing.

Sora hasn't spoken much, and her footsteps are heavy.

The fact that I'm going to be designing the new science museum might be the only saving grace for her.

But it's going to take three years from now for the science museum to be completed.

Sora's going to become an astronomy professor at a university in the meantime.
And... she's also going to become my wife.
One thing ending becomes a large step forward toward something new.
％Ｂ
「Hey, you're gonna start working as a professor in October, right?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
Sora
「...The university's on summer break for all of September, which means I am too.」
％Ｂ
「Do you want to have our wedding ceremony soon, then?」
Sora
「...No iss... Maybe an issue? Preparing a ceremony in a single month would be hard. We wouldn't have much time for the invitations or venue.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, that's true... It'd be a bit too sudden to have everyone attend. That's why I was thinking we could have the reception with everyone afterward... and I wanted to do a wedding ceremony with just the two of us.」


％Ｂ
「...Or I guess it might be more accurate to say we can't really have everyone attend.」
Sora
「...?」
％Ｂ
「I think it'd be a ceremony with just family, but if you're okay with that, then I want to get started on the planning right away.」

Sora
「...Okay.」
％Ｂ
「Really? You sure?」
Sora
「I know you're saying that with me in mind. I can tell that... so no issues.」

Sora
「I know you're saying that with me in mind. I can tell that... so no issues.」

Sora
「But I want to know where we're going.」
％Ｂ
「Okay. I've known for a long time now that if we're gonna have our wedding, it'd have to be there.」

％Ｂ
「It's a place that's world famous for how pretty the stars are, that you told me about a long time ago.」

Sora
「...Mauna Kea...」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. That's where I want our wedding to be.」
Sora
「...No issues.」
