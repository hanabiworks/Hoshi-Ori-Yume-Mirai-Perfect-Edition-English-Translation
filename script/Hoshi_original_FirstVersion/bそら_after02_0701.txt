We lined up our work schedules to go on a date for today, after not being able to do anything of the sort for a while because we've been busy.

I finally got Azuma-san to okay a rough draft for the cultural hall.
Construction's progressing smoothly for Shuuichi's house too.
Things have finally calmed down somewhat in terms of my available time and my mental energy, so we're out for the first time in a while. But...

「So... Why are we here for our date today?」
Sora requested to go to the science museum's planetarium for some reason.\n\r

As in, her workplace.
％Ｂ
「We haven't been out together in a while. We could've driven somewhere a little further out, you know.」

Sora
「...*shake shake*」
Sora
「...Here is good. I wanted to come here.」
％Ｂ
「You wanted to come here? ...But this is your workplace.」
Sora
「...It is, but before that, it's a place I associate with memories.」
％Ｂ
「Memories?」
Sora
「...It's where we went on our first date after we started dating.」
Sora
「...It's where we went on our first date after we started dating.」
％Ｂ
「...I remember I ended up ridiculously late.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
Sora
「...This place is always fun when I'm with you. It's completely different from when I'm usually here for work.」

Sora
「...This place is always fun when I'm with you. It's completely different from when I'm usually here for work.」

％Ｂ
「Well, if that's what you think, then okay...」
Sora
「...And this building's going to be gone soon.」
％Ｂ
「Wha... Gone soon...?」
Sora
「...It's going to be torn down next summer.」
％Ｂ
「It is!?」
I had already heard from Sora that the building had deteriorated significantly.

％Ｂ
「But... Really... So this place is finally closing down.」
％Ｂ
「...It's a shame.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
Sora
「...It's disappointing that a building I have good memories of is going to be gone.」
％Ｂ
「That's true... but this is also a place for your dreams to come true too.」

Sora's dream is to communicate the wonders of the stars to lots of people.
She became a planetarium navigator to make that into reality.

％Ｂ
「After the new show you thought up's started airing and everything too...」

Sora
「...You seem more depressed than I am.」
Sora
「...You seem more depressed than I am.」
％Ｂ
「Of course I'm depressed. This place is important to you. Which means it's important to me too. It's seriously a downer that it's gonna be gone...」


I remember back when I found out that Marinpia Shionagi had closed down after coming back to this town.\n\r

I was pretty depressed back then too...
Sora
「...A place that has good memories for me is going away. That's definitely a shame, but the place for my dreams to come true won't go away.」

％Ｂ
「...What do you mean?」
Sora
「...The building itself is being torn down. After that, it's going to be rebuilt and reopened.」

％Ｂ
「...Reopened?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「I see. So the science museum itself won't be going away.」
It'll still be here, albeit in a different form.
Sora
「And when it reopens, the planetarium will be directed by me...」

％Ｂ
「Seriously!?」
Sora
「...Potentially.」
％Ｂ
「...Potentially? Not for sure?」
Sora
「...I will be if I make the winter show for this year, and that succeeds.」

％Ｂ
「Huh... So it's kinda like a test.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「Can I help you think it up again?」
Sora
「...Of course. I'd like it if you helped.」
Sora
「...Of course. I'd like it if you helped.」
％Ｂ
「Of course I will.」
After we watch the planetarium show, we eat and head to the park.
This is where we can see the stars most clearly without having to drive anywhere.

And more importantly, this is where everything began for the two of us.
％Ｂ
「Oh, by the way, what are you gonna do about work while the science museum's being rebuilt?」
It may just be temporary, but she still won't have work to do as a navigator while the planetarium's gone.

If the science museum itself's not going to be functional, then she probably won't be able to switch to a desk job or anything either.

％Ｂ
「If you want to, you can come work at my firm.」
Sora
「...*shake shake*」
Sora
「...I'm going to university.」
％Ｂ
「University...? Wait, you're gonna take exams again!?」
Sora
「...*shake shake*」
Sora
「...I'm going to teach astronomy as a lecturer.」
％Ｂ
「T-Teach!? You're able to do that?」
Sora
「...*nod* There are no issues because I have a curator license.」
％Ｂ
「Really... Oh yeah, I remember you got the qualifications for that because it's necessary to work at a museum...」

Sora
「...Mhmh.」
She snaps her thumb up at me.
％Ｂ
「Professor Sora, huh...」
Sora
「...? What's wrong?」
％Ｂ
「No, I was just thinking about how you'd probably be popular with the students.」

Sora
「...Jealousy...?」
％Ｂ
「Nah, superiority. "Just look at how cute my girlfriend is!"」
Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「But you know... I know it's gonna be rebuilt, but it still makes me a little sad that a building I have good memories of is going to be gone.」

I just feel kinda sentimental about it.
Since it's the place where Sora and I went on our first date and everything...
Sora
「...Can I be selfish?」
％Ｂ
「Selfish? Sure... But that's rare, coming from you. Or more like... Have you ever?」

Sora
「...It's still private discussion... but the design of the new science museum's going to be decided publicly.」

％Ｂ
「Huh, a competition. The city comes up with some interesting stuff.」
Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「...Wait a second. Are you going to say―」
Sora
「...I want you to design the new building, Ryou.」
Sora
「...I want you to design the new building.」
She looks right into my eyes.
My chest goes hot at her words.
％Ｂ
「Sora... That's not you being selfish.」
I can feel a smile float onto my face from the steadily rising excitement within me.

％Ｂ
「The cultural hall that I'm designing is going to stand on the site where Shionagi First Academy's old school building once stood.」

％Ｂ
「If I'm able to have a hand in working on the science museum too, then I'll be able to personally connect two places from our memories to the future.」


％Ｂ
「I'll be able to directly repay this city that I've lived in for everything it's done for me, with my own hands. Don't you think that's just amazing?」


Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「That wasn't you being selfish just now... In fact, I'm grateful you told me.」

I place my hand on Sora's head.
％Ｂ
「Just watch me, Sora. I'll win that competition for sure!」
Sora
「...*nod*」
We give each other a thumbs-up.
