Touko
「Oh, right. I forgot to mention this, but I'll join the event committee too.」

％Ｂ
「What?」
Touko
「You'd be protecting me from club recruitment there, and we'd get to be together for longer that way too.」




％Ｂ
「Yeah, but... It's gonna be pretty busy, you know. You sure?」
Touko
「You're going to do my share of the work too, right? You said you didn't care if I was just there.」

...Right, I do remember saying something like that.
This was an awfully sweet deal for Touko, in retrospect.
％Ｂ
「Well, sure. I'll talk to Shuuichi about it.」
Touko
「Mhm, please do. I'll come too.」
all
％Ｂ
「Touko, sorry for the wait. The school store was busy.」
Touko
「It's always so busy. I wish they could be more considerate of the girls.」

The school store becomes a battleground for beasts during lunchtime.
I could see how a girl might not be able to manage there.
Touko
「What bread did you buy!? Hurry, hurry! I'm hungryyy!」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, yeah. Just wait a minute.」
all
I start laying out the bread and drinks I bought on the desk.
Melon cookie bread, yakisoba bread, croquette bread, fried bread, and curry bread.

I just picked up coffee-flavored milk for drinks.
Quite the spoils of war, if I do say so myself. I'm glad I sprinted to the school store right away.

Touko
「What should I start wiiith... Which do you want, Ryousuke-kun?」

Touko
「What should I start wiiith... Which do you want?」

％Ｂ
「The yakisoba bread!」
Touko
「Ahaha, then let's start with that. Just a second... Okay, say "ahhh."」

％Ｂ
「Wha?」
Touko
「I'll eat it if you don't hurry, you know. Though if you don't want any...」

％Ｂ
「I-I do! Ahhh!」
Touko
「Hehehe, this is fun, isn't it? I really like doing this. It's like I'm feeding a pet.」

％Ｂ
「...Mh. Come on, you don't have to say it like that.」
Touko
「I think I want the melon cookie bread. I like sweet bread.」

She's not even listening to me.
It looks like she's already overcome the embarrassment from the whole "Say 'Ahhh'" thing and just enjoys it now.

％Ｂ
「What's wrong? Aren't you gonna eat?」
Touko
「What? Aren't you going to feed me?」
...You're gonna make me do it too?
I know it's just us here, but it's still embarrassing...
％Ｂ
「O-Okay then... Say "ahhh."」
Touko
「Ahhh... Mmmh, delicious! This one's great!」
％Ｂ
「Oh, really? Then I'll try some too...」
Touko
「No! I'm going to feed you! Say "ahhh."」

％Ｂ
「A-Ahhh...」
...Are we gonna keep this up until we're finished eating?
all
Natsuki
「Oh, you're back. Where'd you eat lunch today?」
％Ｂ
「I was eating with Touko. Ended up taking a bit longer than I expected.」
Natsuki
「...Maybe you were eating Touko!」
％Ｂ
「Excuse me!? Wh-What do you think you're even saying!?」
Natsuki
「Wait, that reaction was suspicious, wasn't it!? What do you think, Rikka!?」

Rikka
「I-I don't know. I couldn't really hear because I was listening to music.」
Natsuki
「If you were eating with Touko, then it was in the old school building, right!? A guy and a girl who've only just started dating, sitting in a quiet, atmospheric place like that! There's no way nothing happened!」


％Ｂ
「I'm serious, it's nothing! I was fighting over the bread with her!」

Rikka
「...You should calm down when you eat. You're not a child.」
I couldn't possibly tell them we were feeding each other.
I need to do my best to try to pull the wool over Segawa's eyes now that she's this worked up.

all
％Ｂ
「Shuuichi. Touko says she'll join the committee.」
Shuuichi
「Seriously!? Good work! Now we're gonna get droves of guys joining for Yukimura!」

...Maybe we shouldn't do this after all.
I personally don't like the idea of other guys showing up for Touko.

Touko
「Mmm... That sounds like a pain. I'm not really interested in other guys.」

Shuuichi
「...Couldn't you at least talk to them? Guys are pretty naive about that kinda stuff, you know.」

Touko
「I don't care about that. You tell them all no for me, Four-Eyes-kun.」
Shuuichi
「F-Four-Eyes-kun? Is that me?」
Touko
「If there's someone you like in there, then you can date him if you want. I'll let you have him.」

Shuuichi
「Shut up! I'm a freaking guy! I've got eyes only for Kaori-san!」

％Ｂ
「Now calm down, Four-Eyes-kun. You might change your mind if Kaori-san dumps you, right?」

Shuuichi
「Don't you go along with this! You two just made all the glasses users of the world your enemies, you know that!? Being called "Four-Eyes" is rank three for the worst possible shame for people who wear glasses, all right!?」


Touko
「Wow, really. So what's rank one?」
Shuuichi
「People making fun of me when my glasses fog up in the winter after I've been outside. That seriously makes me want to kill someone.」

I guess they do say glasses are a part of one's face.
So I guess from that perspective, making fun of someone's glasses is the same as making fun of their face.
Shuuichi
「Fine, I'll hold off on using Yukimura as bait for recruits... They probably wouldn't be much use anyway.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, just forget about it. We can't rely on people who joined the committee for a reason like that.」

Shuuichi
「...Says the guy who used the committee as an excuse to make a move on Yukimura.」
Can't heeear you.
Now that we're done telling Shuuichi about Touko joining, let's get to my other objective.
all
％Ｂ
「Anyway, Shuuichi, I've got a proposal... or more like I wanna ask a favor of you.」
Shuuichi
「A favor? What is it?」
％Ｂ
「It's about the old school building being opened up. What's the situation with that right now?」
Shuuichi
「Ah, well the negotiations are apparently still ongoing... but the clubs trying to get it approved are really putting a lot of work into it. I'm guessing it'll be settled with a partial opening pretty soon.」


％Ｂ
「You'll need someone to be in charge of managing the old school building once it's been opened up, right? Touko and I wanna do that.」

Shuuichi
「...You sure? That's gonna be a pretty heavy workload. We'll have to adjust things right away too...」

％Ｂ
「Yeah. And I'll do other work if I'm needed, of course. So please, let us do this.」

Shuuichi
「Hm... Okay. If you really want to that badly, then I'll recommend having you two as the ones in charge.」

I want to do what I can beforehand.
There probably wouldn't be too many people who have a problem with this, and I doubt there would be that much competition for something like this either.

Shuuichi
「I want you to check up on the clubs listed here today.」
％Ｂ
「Got it. We'll go do that now, then.」
Shuuichi
「Oh, right. Just a second. Come here.」
％Ｂ
「Huh?」
Shuuichi pulls me into a corner.
What the heck does he want?
Shuuichi
「Here, have this. It's to celebrate you two dating.」
％Ｂ
「Wh-What the... This is...! The hell are you thinking!?」

Male contraceptives.
AKA, condoms.
Shuuichi
「Better make sure you've always got one ready from now on. Oh, but don't mess around while you're doing event committee work.」

％Ｂ
「That's not the issue here! Why the hell are you giving me this!?」

Shuuichi
「It's important, right? Especially if you care about Yukimura. It's the guy's job to have stuff like this ready.」


％Ｂ
「Y-Yeah, but...!」
Shuuichi
「Do your best now, virgin.」
Dammit, he's looking down on me...!
But I can't say anything because he's actually more experienced than I am when it comes to this...!
Touko
「Hey, what'd you get from Four-Eyes-kun just now?」
％Ｂ
「Wha!? It-It was... just a little congratulatory gift, yeah!」
Touko
「Really? Show me show me.」
As iiiif!
Please don't give me that untainted smile!
You're filling me up with guilt!
％Ｂ
「It's just a little charm! It's nothing rare, the kinda thing you could find anywhere!」

Touko
「A charm? Why would he give you a charm as a congratulatory gift?」
％Ｂ
「I-I have no idea! Anyway, let's get our work done so we can go to the old school building!」

Touko
「Ah, heeey! Don't puuull!」
％Ｂ
「We're members of the event committee! We'd like to speak with the track and field club!」

Female Track and Field Club Member A
「Yes, is there something... Wait, Yukimura-san!? You're finally joining the track and field club!?」

％Ｂ
「Whoa!?」
Touko
「I joined the event committee. I'm not going to be joining any clubs, so could you stop?」

Female Track and Field Club Member A
「Whaaat!? But we've left a space open for you in the 200-meter dash...!」

Touko
「No, I'm not interested at all. I only ran because you told me to just do it once.」

all
It's my job to protect Touko from being recruited by the clubs.
Looks like it's already time for me to get to work... All right, I'll make my point clear right from the start here!
％Ｂ
「Sorry, but Touko and I are busy with preparations for the Tanabata Festival.」
Female Track and Field Club Member A
「...You don't have anything to do with this, do you? Could you not butt in?」
％Ｂ
「Uh...」
Female Track and Field Club Member A
「Yukimura-san! Please, couldn't you run together with me!? Let's bet the golden years of our youth on the world of millisecond-precision splits!」

％Ｂ
「Aagh!?」
Touko
「I don't wanna, because that sounds like too much pressure. I like relaxing and taking naps.」
Female Track and Field Club Member A
「Gh... I'm not giving up, okay!? I'll always have a uniform and bib ready for you!」

...And she's gone.
What a heroic club member...
all
％Ｂ
「...We didn't get to confirm anything from that! Aren't there any other track and field people here!?」

Female Track and Field Club Member B
「Oh, Yukimura-san!? You're finally interested in the high jump!?」

...How much have these people been expecting out of you, Touko?
It looks like her joining the event committee isn't going to be enough to get the recruitment to stop.
Which means... Wait, am I gonna have to keep turning people down myself for her from now on!?
Touko
「Ahaha, I'll have to have you protect me for a while. Thanks in advance, okay?」

％Ｂ
「...No problem.」
all
％Ｂ
「We didn't have any time to relax today, huh.」
Touko
「I'm tiiired... I think I might pass on this tomorrooow...」
It was already sundown by the time we finished our work for the event committee.
It might've been pretty rough for Touko, who's only ever just done her own thing and played around until now.

％Ｂ
「Don't lose heart on the first day. We turned down a lot of requests for you to join the clubs today, so I bet things'll be easier starting tomorrow.」

Touko
「I don't really wanna do work without a reward... I'll try my best tomorrow too if you'll give me a reward.」

％Ｂ
「A reward... What do you want? I'll do it if it's something I can pull off.」

Touko
「Mmm... I want something tasty.」
％Ｂ
「Let's see... All right, then I'll make you a lunchbox for tomorrow. How about that?」

Touko
「Really!? A handmade lunch!?」
％Ｂ
「But just so you know, I'm not particularly good at cooking or anything, all right? Don't expect too much.」

Touko
「Ehehe, I'm excited, I'm excited! I think I might skip breakfast tomorrooow!」

％Ｂ
「Whoa now, that's a lot of pressure... Though, well, look forward to lunch tomorrow.」

Touko
「Okay! Let's go home, then!」
all
％Ｂ
「Hm?」
【Touko】_st_0308
I went over the basics of LIME stamps with Touko on the way home.\n\r

Looks like she's already using them. She must have taken a liking to them.
【％Ｂ】「Using them already?」
【Touko】「Mhm. I have to do my #Nbest so you'll make me #Nlunch.」
【Touko】_st_0308
【Touko】_st_0308
【Touko】「I wonder what you're #Ngoing to maaake.」
【％Ｂ】「You'll just have to #Nwait until tomorrow to #Nfind out.」
【Touko】_st_0308
【Touko】_st_0308
She's sure into those stamps...
I'm personally happy about it, since this just means I'll get more communication from her in general.

【Touko】「I hungrily await.」
【％Ｂ】「You better eat #Nbreakfast though, all #Nright?」
【Touko】_st_0310
【Touko】「Can I come a little #Nearly tomorrow?」
【％Ｂ】「Sure. Why?」
【Touko】「Because I'm so excited!」
【Touko】_st_0307
...Looks like I'll have to do my best to meet her expectations.
I won't regret any effort I put into making something good if I get to see Touko smile.

【％Ｂ】「I'm gonna go get stuff #Nready for tomorrow then.」
【Touko】「Mhm, okay!」
％Ｂ
「All right, let's get started!」
I start getting things ready while I look up a recipe on my phone.
I already picked up all the necessary ingredients at the supermarket after I parted ways with Touko on the way home.
I can significantly reduce the amount of time I need to spend tomorrow morning if I get things ready now.

％Ｂ
「...Okay. All the ingredients are ready.」
I've decided on making teriyaki chicken, carrots sautéed in sesame oil, and egg-wrapped spinach.

I'm going to focus on taste, presentation, and volume.
％Ｂ
「Let's start with the preliminary stuff, then. Make the sauce and marinate the meat, cut up the carrots...」

I never thought I'd ever get this serious about making lunch.
Knowing that I'm doing this for Touko... is making it all kinda fun!
