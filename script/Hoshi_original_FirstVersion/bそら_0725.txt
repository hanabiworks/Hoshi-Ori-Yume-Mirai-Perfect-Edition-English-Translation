And so it's finally the last day of work for us.
Today's apparently the last day of the stamp rally, so the marketplace is bustling with even more activity than usual.

Grade-School Boy A
「Oh, it's Shio-wan!」
Grade-School Girl A
「Shio-wan!」
Female High Schooler B
「Look, look, it's Shio-wan! Shio-nyah's here too! I wanna take a photo with them～♪」

Grade-School Boy B
「Shio-wan, shake my hand!」
Everyone loves Shio-wan after what happened yesterday.
They're all running to try to take photos with him or touch him.

Old Lady
「Oh my, what an adorable little doll.」
Shio-nyah
「...」
all
Shio-nyah falls over on the spot after being called adorable.
Old Lady
「Oh my, are you all right?」
I was worried about Sora, but I'm glad she seems to be doing fine.
It's our last day, so if she can get through this without too much―
Grade-School Boy A
「Shio-wan, do the side-stepping!」
Shio-wan
「...」
...Why do they know about that??
They didn't just happen to see the new stuff that got added to the website just yesterday, did they?
Staff
「Shio-wan does super-speed side-stepping when justice burns in his heart!」

You!
Staff
「But Shio-wan loves his side-stepping, so he can still do just those fast even when justice isn't burning in his heart!」

It's gotten even worse! Why can't we just stick with what was written!?
Oh god, look! The kids are looking at me so expectantly now!
Shio-wan
「...～～～～～」
％Ｂ
（Uoooooooooooohhhhhhhh!!）
Grade-School Boy A
「Whoa, he's so fast!」
％Ｂ
（The costume head's so heavy! Everything's shaking! I feel sick!）
Grade-School Girl A
「You're so cool, Shio-wan!」
％Ｂ
（Uooooooooooooooooooooooohhhhhhhhhh!!）
They all love the side-stepping.
Thank god I still have good leg muscles from back when I used to play soccer...
But still, doing this while wearing the costume―
Shio-wan
「...Hahh... Hahh... Hahh...」
Is pretty... rough...
Shuuichi
「...Hahh... Hahh... Hahh...」
Uh?
Shuuichi
「Hey... Yukimura... Could you hold at least one of these? ...These... are really heavy...」

Touko
「I told you, didn't I? I'm fragile. I can't hold heavy things.」

Shuuichi
「Kh... You liar... I know about everything you've done in the athletic clubs.」
Shuuichi... and Yukimura...!?
I can't believe even they've shown up...
It looks like they're in the middle of gathering up cardboard too. Shuuichi's shouldering a huge pile of it.

Shuuichi
「Oh... It's Shio-wan and Shio-nyah.」
Touko
「Ahaha, what the heck? Are those mascots or something? Why's he doing side-steps?」

Shuuichi
「Hey, let's go take a look, as a break.」
Touko
「Mmm... Sure, why not.」
No, just go back to school without any detours.
Please. I beg you.
Touko
「I guess this one's a cat? It sure looks unmotivated.」
Shio-nyah
「...」
all
Yukimura walks over to Shio-nyah.
And as for Shuuichi...
Shuuichi
「...」
He's staring at Shio-wan for some reason.
Is this guy a fan of mascot characters or something?
all
Grade-School Boy A
「Shio-wan, do the side-stepping again!」
You've gotta be kidding me...
Ughhh... Damn you and your excited eyes...
％Ｂ
（Uooooooooooohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!）
Grade-School Boy A
「He's sooo fast!」
Shio-wan
「...Hahh... Hahh... Hahh...」
Shuuichi
「...」
Shuuichi's still looking at me.
The hell does he want...?
Shuuichi
「Hey. 
Shio-wan... You're not... Ryousuke, are you
Why the hell are you Shio-wan
?」

Gh...!?
H-How'd he figure it out!?
I haven't talked! There's no way!
Shuuichi
「That's you, right? Hey, Yukimu―」
I immediately put Shuuichi in a headlock.
Shuuichi
「Wha... Ow!?」
Grade-School Boy B
「Oh, Shio-wan's in a battle!」
Grade-School Girl A
「Do your best, Shio-wan!」
Grade-School Boy A
「Get that guy!」
Shuuichi
「Wh-Why am I the bad guy...?」
Shio-wan
「...How'd you know?」
I ask quietly, so only Shuuichi can hear.
Shuuichi
「S-So it is you... Ow, ow... That hurts!」
Grade-School Boy B
「Beat him up, Shio-wan!」
Shuuichi
「I-I recognized the side-stepping... The way you moved back on your heels and stuff... Ow, ow!」

Shio-wan
「...I'm surprised you noticed from that.」
Shuuichi
「What can I say... Ow, ow... So then... does that mean Shio-nyah's Ousaka?」
Shio-wan
「...Yeah, that's right. We were keeping quiet 'cause she's embarrassed about it. You better not tell anyone either, all right?」


Shuuichi
「Y-Yeah, I know... I know, so let go!」
all
I release Shuuichi and then force him into a hug.
The kids should think we've made up this way.
Grade-School Boy A
「Shio-wan's forgiving the bad guy!」
Grade-School Girl A
「You're so nice, Shio-wan!」
There we go. Just like I wanted.
...Wait a second... What the heck is Yukimura doing!?
Touko
「Mmm? Mmm～? Huuuh?」
Yukimura's standing in front of Shio-nyah, peering into the mesh that lets Sora see outside.\n\r

I've never seen anyone go that far.
Touko
「Hmm, I can't really see that well, but I feel like I know you from somewhere...」

Shio-nyah
「...」
Shio-nyah turns her head away.
But Yukimura moves to the side and keeps looking through.
all
Shio-wan
「...H-Hey... Grab Yukimura and take her somewhere else.」
I whisper into Shuuichi's ear as I hug him.
Shio-wan
「...Or else Yukimura's gonna find out it's Sora!」
Shuuichi
「G-Got it.」
all
I release Shuuichi.
Shuuichi
「Yukimura! Let's get going already!」

Touko
「Wait a second. I'm trying to find out who's inside this...」
Shuuichi
「Don't talk about who's inside with kids around! Come on, let's go!」

Touko
「Okaaay. Bye then, Cat-chan. You're super cute.」
all
Shio-nyah
「...」
all
Shio-nyah crumples onto the ground.
Sora's a true professional.
Still though, I didn't think Yukimura would try that hard to try to figure out who was in the suit.\n\r

She's got good instinct. Or maybe she's just impolite...
Either way, we don't need to worry anymore.
All right. We're almost done with work.
Let's give it our all until the end!
Staff
「Great work today! Thanks so much for helping us in this heat. We really appreciate it!」

％Ｂ
「Oh no, likewise from us. Thank you very much.」
Staff
「Here you go, then. This is your pay for today.」
％Ｂ
「Thank you very much!」
Sora
「...Thank you... very much.」
all
We receive our final paycheck.
With this, we've earned 90,000 yen total.
10,000 yen more than our goal.
Staff
「Your side-stepping today was amazing. You should be Shio-wan again the next time we do this. And your acting as Shio-nyah was great too. We'd love to have you again.」


％Ｂ
「Ahaha... We'll think about it.」
We head back to school after work.
Shuuichi
「Oh, they're back. Welcome back.」
Touko
「Welcome back～」
Marika
「Welcome back. Today must've been rough with how hot it was.」
Everyone's here.
％Ｂ
「Yeah, it was, but we managed to get the money we need.」

Touko
「Now we can rent that projector.」
all
Misa
「I'm very happy for you, Sora-san.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
all
Rikka
「And we were able to collect a lot more cardboard than we needed too.」

Narusawa points out the stack of cardboard in the corner.
％Ｂ
「Whoa, that's awesome! Thanks so much, you guys! This should be more than enough. Right, Sora?」


Sora
「...Thank you.」
all
Natsuki
「Man, we were a little nervous though, 'cause we were starting to get less and less every day.」

Natsuki
「More importantly, where were you two working? I went looking for you, but I couldn't find you.」

％Ｂ
「Uh...」
Misa
「We also went, but we were unable to spot you.」

Touko
「Were you really working in the marketplace?」
％Ｂ
「Y-Yeah... Of course we were. Right, Sora?」
all
Sora
「...*nod*」
Rikka
「Though we did see these weird mascot characters called Shio-wan and Shio-nyah.」
all
Touko
「Oh, those two. We saw them too. That unmotivated-looking cat and the dog with the closed eyes.」

Marika
「We saw them too～ Shio-nyah was so cute.」
Touko
「Yeah, yeah, it was kind of a slow burn... I don't really know what it was exactly about that cat, but it was just kinda cute.」

Marika
「Mhm, she was so cute～」
all
Sora
「...」
all
Natsuki
「Huh? What's wrong, Sora?」
Misa
「Why are you on the ground?」
Sora
「...Gasp...!」
all
％Ｂ
「Oh, come on...」
You can't just keep doing that...
