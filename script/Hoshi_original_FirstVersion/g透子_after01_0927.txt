Touko
「Nnnh... This is hard.」
She has her head in her hands in front of her workbook.
I've been seeing this less and less recently... but she's still got a ways to go before she'll be able to pass.

Teaching Touko's a good opportunity for me to make sure I really know my stuff.
And a lot of what interior design coordinators do is incorporated in what architects do too.

Approaching things with a different perspective like this is interesting and it makes for a good learning opportunity.
I've been enjoying playing the part of Touko's tutor more than I had expected.
Touko
「Could you help me with this paaart? I feel like all my responses are kinda right, kinda wrong... I'm getting all turned around.」


％Ｂ
「Let's see... Your response for H is wrong. Right here. If the structure's weak near the ground level, then you need to use a deep foundation to support it.」


Touko
「Oh, I get it. Mmm... The architecture-related questions are where I keep tripping up... I've been gradually understanding more of the interior design ones.」

％Ｂ
「I can teach you that stuff, so I'll make sure you understand it. Though a decent amount of it's just memorization.」

Touko
「A lot of the materials have names that are hard to remember... Isn't there some kinda trick you can use for remembering them?」

％Ｂ
「That's just how specialist knowledge goes. You need to take the effort to remember it now, or else you'll regret it later.」


Touko
「Mmmh... Okaaay.」
She turns back toward her books.
I should probably stay quiet if she's going to work on memorizing stuff.

％Ｂ
「Oh, it's pretty late... I should start getting dinner ready. What do you wanna eat today, Touko?」


Touko
「Mmm... You handle it... I can't use my brain for anything else right now...」

％Ｂ
「Haha, okay. I'll think about it while I'm getting groceries, then.」

Touko
「Mhm, thanks. Ahaha, now things are the opposite as before.」
Touko supported me before my exams.
Now it's my turn to do the same for her.
％Ｂ
「Don't worry about it. You've got it worse than I did, 'cause you started later.」
Touko
「Mm, I'll do my best. Oh, make sure you buy pudding for dessert, okay? My brain doesn't work at all without something sweet.」

％Ｂ
「Yes, yes. I'm going, then.」
all
Touko's focusing on studying even after dinner.
Helping her study reminds me of back when we were in high school. It fills me with nostalgia.

％Ｂ
「You used to get bored of studying right away back then. I remember I had to convince you with sweets and stuff.」

Touko
「Huh? What are you talking about?」
％Ｂ
「I was just wondering what the you from back in high school would think if she saw you studying like that.」

Touko
「Mmm... She'd probably point and laugh. This is the first time I've been this serious about studying ever.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, it was hard getting you to study for university admission exams too... I wish you would've been even half as focused back then as you are now.」

Touko
「It's fine since I got in, riiight? All's well that ends well.」

％Ｂ
「...Shouldn't I be the one saying that?」
Touko
「Don't worry so much about the details. I'm sure I'll pass my exam now that I'm putting in this much effort.」

I do think she's doing really well.
She's been putting in all the effort she can, and she's really started to understand the subject matter.
But... she just started preparing too late.
I've been studying in the same world, and that's exactly why I can't be optimistic.
It isn't a world that's easy enough to be able to pass an exam with nothing more than three months of studying.

Touko
「So what do you think? Can I pass?」
％Ｂ
「...I dunno. I think it'll depend on the questions you get on the exam. It might be a bit iffy if you get a lot of architecture-related questions.」

Touko
「Mmh... Don't you think you're being a little cold? This is where you're supposed to be nice and encouraging with an "It'll be okay."」


％Ｂ
「I can't say anything irresponsible. I know your current level better than anyone since I've been teaching you.」

Touko
「Mmm... There's only a little time left before the exam, so maybe I should try guessing what'll be on the exam and study that... I won't be able to cover everything starting now.」

％Ｂ
「Not knowing things properly is only gonna hurt you later on. If you're gonna study, then you should make sure you learn it all one thing at a time.」


Touko
「...You're such a strict teacher.」
