The next morning.
I show up at our meeting place, blearily rubbing my eyes, to find Okihara-senpai already there. As expected.

％Ｂ
「Good morning...」
Misa
「Good morning. It's a wonderful morning!」
％Ｂ
「Yes... It is...」
Though it's too early for even the trains to have started moving.
％Ｂ
「So where are we headed to today? Where are we going...? I've only brought a swimsuit...」


I'm going on a vacation together with Okihara-senpai.
She still hasn't told me where we're going.
She's only said that it was her special, secret spot...
Misa
「That is a secret.」
...I figured.
I'll just have to steel myself and hope for the best.
％Ｂ
「I understand. I'll follow you anywhere!」

Misa
「Fufu... Then shall we start on our way?」
all
We spend two hours on the first train out.
We arrive at―
％Ｂ
「We're at... Japan's Maldives!?」
It's the same fishing village from before.
What? Are we gonna watch the sea fireflies again?
No, there'd be no reason for her to keep it a secret then.
The last time we were here, I got to see the otherworldly beauty of sea fireflies illuminating the twilight sea.

We can't see that now, of course. But watching the sunlight glitter off of the surface of the ocean is also beautiful.


Misa
「Let's see～」
She's looking around.
％Ｂ
「What are you looking for?」
Misa
「A boat.」
％Ｂ
「Uh... A boat?」
Misa
「I've asked them to come pick us up...」
Misa
「Oh, that appears to be them!」
all
％Ｂ
「...Hm?」
Keizou
「Heeeeeey～! Misa-chaaan～!」
I can see a fishing boat off in the distance.
The man waving at us from deck appears to be...
％Ｂ
「Is that... Keizou-san!?」
It's the fisherman who we met back when we came here for the sea fireflies.

Misa
「Keizou-saaan!」
％Ｂ
「The boat that's picking us up... is that!?」
Misa
「Yes, it is.」
If we're getting on a fishing boat... Wait, does that mean the vacation that she's talking about is going fishing!?\n\r

That's so wild...
The two of us move to the docks.
Misa
「Good morning, Keizou-san.」
Keizou
「Morning, Misa-chan. And I've met you before, haven't I?」

％Ｂ
「Thank you very much for your help back then.」
Misa
「Thank you for agreeing to help today too, Keizou-san.」
Keizou
「Leave it to me! I've already got the equipment on board. Now, get on!」

Misa
「Let's go!」
％Ｂ
「Y-Yes.」
She pulls me by the hand onto the boat.
％Ｂ
「It kind of feels like we're going to go explore an uninhabited island or something.」
Moving across the great open sea like this just tickles the male fancy.
It almost makes me wanna strike a pose at the prow.
Though I won't, because I'd probably get yelled at.
Misa
「Oh, did you figure it out?」
％Ｂ
「What? Wait, so we're really...?」
Misa
「We're currently heading toward Urashima Island.」
％Ｂ
「Urashima Island... I feel like I've heard of it.」
Misa
「It's an outlying island about ten kilometers ahead of where we are. It's still technically part of Shionagi City.」

An outlying island that's part of Shionagi...
Now that she mentions it, I feel like my dad told me about something like that back when I was a kid.

Misa
「It's uninhabited... but there's a research station that belongs to Marinpia Shionagi over there. It's unused now, of course.」


Misa
「You can see many different varieties of fish there, due to the arrangement of the currents.」

％Ｂ
「Ohhh! So that means...!」
Misa
「I was thinking we could increase our collection of fish a little more, now that we've received permission to use one of the larger classrooms in the old school building...」

％Ｂ
「I-I see! So today's vacation is something we're just calling a vacation when it's actually a collection trip...」


Misa
「W-We aren't just calling it that! Coming into contact with fish is incredibly soothing!」

Misa
「Well, yes, I did... have some practical motives, but...」
She's fidgeting a bit.
Misa
「But I'm sure this will be very fun!」
And that's the end of her argument.
But I guess she's right.
The deep blue sea and fish, together with Okihara-senpai.
It's not what I was expecting, but this is still definitely gonna be fun.
％Ｂ
「I understand! Let's take on Urashima Island today, then!」
Keizou
「You've got some spirit, kiddo. Here, take this.」

I accept a bag from Keizou-san.
％Ｂ
「Heavy!?」
What is this!?
I almost broke my back just taking this from him!
％Ｂ
「What... What's in here!?」
Misa
「Diving equipment!」
％Ｂ
「Wha... Diving?」
Misa
「Instead of the usual tide-pool collecting, I would like to dive into the sea to do collection today.」

％Ｂ
「O-Oh really... You're going to dive... That sounds pretty tough.」

Misa
「Let's dive together
, Ryousuke-san

!」
％Ｂ
「Wha... I'm diving too!? But I've never done it before.」

Keizou
「No need to worry. Misa-chan's got an instructor certification too.」

％Ｂ
「...You're kidding.」
Keizou
「And Misa-chan, I've got what you asked me for right here.」
Misa
「Oh, I'll take that, then.」
Keizou
「No, no. The man has to hold things like these. You look like you've got some muscle on you, kiddo. Here, take this too.」


％Ｂ
「Nuoooohhhh!?」
Two cooler boxes on top of the diving equipmeeent!?
Keizou
「You wanted me to come pick you up in the evening, right?」
Misa
「Yes. Thank you very much.」
Keizou
「Roger that. I can't believe that little Misa-chan's gotten old enough to bring a boyfriend like this...」


％Ｂ
「Wha... B-Boyfriend?」
Misa
「N-No! That isn't the case!」
Huh. Okihara-senpai looks flustered for once.
Keizou
「No need to worry. I'll stay quiet about this to your old man. Your secret's safe with me.」
Misa
「K-Keizou-san!」
Keizou
「Anyway, I'll be back in the evening.」
Misa
「G-Geez... That Keizou-san... I apologize

, Ryousuke-san

...」
％Ｂ
「Oh no... It-It's fine.」
％Ｂ
「Um, should I... put these bags down?」
It'd be nice to just watch her blush...
But I think I wanna set down these unbelievably heavy bags for now.
The Marinpia Shionagi research station is right by the shore.

Okihara-senpai unlocks the door and flips a switch to turn on the lights.

％Ｂ
「Oh, so there's still electricity running here?」
Misa
「You can use the water lines too. You can heat the baths with the propane gas, and you can even cook.」


Misa
「There's also a sleeping chamber for people who are staying here for research.」
％Ｂ
「A hotel by any other name, I guess.」
Misa
「It's a bit dusty since it hasn't been in use for a while...」

％Ｂ
「Oh no, this is plenty.」
all
The room's nice and cool, so we don't even need air conditioning.
Jokes aside, it really is like a hotel.
Though it's not like we're gonna stay the night.
％Ｂ
「This is finally starting to feel like a vacation.」
Misa
「What? ...Finally?」
％Ｂ
「Oh, uh...」
...I said what was on my mind without thinking.
Misa
「
Ryousuke-san
Um
... Let me just say one thing.」
％Ｂ
「Y-Yes?」
She looms closer with a bit of a scary look on her face.
...Did I make her angry?
Misa
「The vacation's only just begun!」
％Ｂ
「Wha... Only just begun?」
Misa
「Please, change into your swimsuit!」
％Ｂ
「R-Roger that!」
all
After I change into my swimsuit like she told me to, we head to the shoreline so I can get a lecture on diving.

Misa
「We will not be able to communicate with our voices underwater. What do you think we do instead to communicate?」

％Ｂ
「Uhh... I think... you use your hands... to signal?」
Misa
「Correct! I will now teach you a few important signals, so please make sure you memorize them. First, this is―」


％Ｂ
「Um, Okihara-senpai. What happened to the vacation...?」
I feel like I'm back to studying for an exam.
Actually, I feel like she's being even stricter now.
Misa
「You must learn what needs to be learned first! Being unprepared when diving can lead to very serious accidents!」


％Ｂ
「I-I'm sorry!」
Misa
「The vacation can wait until after you learn the signals.」
Looks like I'll just have to do my best to memorize these.
I've already managed to escape failing marks on my exams when I was in dire straits. This shouldn't be difficult!

And so...
After finally receiving the okay from Okihara-senpai, I find myself instantly in a vacation mood as soon as we dive into the sea.

％Ｂ
「...!?」
Whoaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh!?
What the heeeeeeckkk!?
This is crazyyyyy!
Oh man... Oh man, I never knew Shionagi's ocean was so beautiful!

The water's so clear, it's like I'm floating in the sky.
There are vividly colored schools of fish flying... I mean, swimming alongside me.

The ocean floor is also beautiful.
Tiny islands of rugged rocks stick out amidst the white sands.
I can see what looks like coral growing here and there.
The bright green bunches of seaweed flutter slowly in the current, as if they were waving at me.
This might be what Ryugu Castle was supposed to look like.
And if this is Ryugu Castle, then Okihara-senpai swimming gracefully before me is... Princess Otohime?

％Ｂ
「...」
Oh man... She's so pretty.
Combined with the scenery around us, she's a beautiful sight.
And the fish seem to understand that too.
Lots of fish are gathering around her.
Okihara-senpai frolicking with the fish...
If I had a waterproof camera, I'd definitely be taking tons of photos, just like Segawa...

If I could capture this scene in the viewfinder...
I know for sure the resulting photo would take anyone's breath away.
...Hm?
She's making some kind of signal at me.
『Let's move... over there?』
Let's see, I just need to give an OK sign as a response, right?
『OK, OK.』
She begins slowly swimming on ahead after seeing my response.
I follow after her.
I can see the beautiful tones of her skin through my mask.
I can appreciate every single one of her elegant movements.
My heart starts thumping just watching.
...Crap.
She told me my oxygen consumption would increase if I got too agitated underwater.

Calm down. Calm down.
Just calm down and follow after her...
％Ｂ
（She really does have a nice figure...）
And yet, I can't take my eyes off of her.
$$smh_OpenCHK
Fish of various colors swim around in the cooler box we've filled with seawater.\n\r

They're the fish we collected today.
Though Okihara-senpai caught most of them while snorkeling, and all I did was just help...

The trick is apparently to take a visible, colored net and use that to chase them into a separate transparent one.

I tried it myself...
But I could barely even get near the fish in the first place.
Misa
「Hehe... Have you gotten that vacation feel yet?」
％Ｂ
「This is amazing! The ocean's so beautiful it completely took my breath away! I really feel like I understand how Urashima Tarou felt!」


Misa
「That's wonderful! I'm also glad I invited you to come with me!」

Misa
「So shall we wrap things up for the morning and have lunch?」

％Ｂ
「Speaking of, how are we going to eat?」
She said they have gas and electricity, but you can't cook food if you don't have ingredients.

Misa
「We will have to be self-sufficient.」
％Ｂ
「Y-You're not saying... we're going to fish?」
Misa
「I hear one can often catch black porgies around here. We will have to do our best.」

％Ｂ
「So no food until then... I-I understand. I don't have experience fishing, but I'll do my best to catch some!」

Misa
「...Hehe.」
％Ｂ
「Hm?」
Misa
「That would be a joke.」
Misa
「There is no need to worry. I've already asked Keizou-san to ready food for us.」


all
She opens up the other cooler box that Keizou-san handed us earlier.

％Ｂ
「Ohh!」
It's stuffed full of vegetables and meat.
Misa
「See? No issue, right? I was obviously joking when I said we would need to fish our own food.」

％Ｂ
「Y-Yes, that's right...」
...The thing is, it doesn't sound like a joke when she's the one saying it.
％Ｂ
「We could probably cook anything with all this. What should we make?」

Misa
「Yes, I was thinking we could make curry.」
％Ｂ
「Huh? ...Curry?」
Misa
「The curry that we ate together with the others when we went camping was very delicious.」

Now that she mentions it, I remember she was really enjoying the curry back then.

Misa
「I wanted to eat the same curry as we did back then.」
Looking at it, I do see onions, carrots, pork, and cubes of curry roux in there.

What's more, the roux is the same brand as back then, both mild and hot.

％Ｂ
「I get it... Okay, let's do it, then! Let's make the same camping curry as we did back then.」

Misa
「Yes!」
all
Misa
「Mgh... mgh...」
％Ｂ
「...How is it?」
I'm asking her for her opinion as she eats the curry we made.
I think we made it exactly the same way as we did back then...
Misa
「Well... I feel it may be slightly different from the curry back then.」

％Ｂ
「Huh?」
...Did we mess something up?
Misa
「It's even more delicious than back then!」
％Ｂ
「Wha... Please don't scare me like that.」
Misa
「I'm sorry. It's just really delicious, so... Hehe.」

％Ｂ
「Is it really? I'll have some too, then... Hamh... mgh, mgh... gulp. Ohh? This is great!」


Misa
「Isn't it? It's very delicious!」
Misa
「But I wonder why it's different? We made it exactly the same way we did back then, didn't we?」

％Ｂ
「Maybe it's because it's filled with a lot more love than before?」

％Ｂ
「People always say that food tastes better the more love that goes into cooking it.」

Misa
「Um... And as for that love, whose would that be, and for what?」

％Ｂ
「Uh... Well, obviously...」
Misa
「Obviously...?」
％Ｂ
「It...It's my... I mean, your love for the ocean... Y-You know, since last time we made that curry in the mountains, didn't we? It must have turned out better because we're at sea this time.」


Misa
「Huh... I see, so that's how it works.」
％Ｂ
「Yes, it is. Hahaha...」
all
...What the heck was I about to say to her just now?
Love and all that...
I need to calm down.
I'm just not myself today.
This situation's just so unfamiliar to me that it's making my lips looser.
Misa
「...Is something the matter?」
％Ｂ
「Oh, no... This is seriously amazing, isn't it!? Hamh, hagh!」

all
I shovel the curry into my mouth to try to cover up my thoughts.
We relax with some black tea after cleaning up.
％Ｂ
「I can't believe you even had after-meal tea ready...」
Misa
「I have overlooked nothing.」
all
She smiles confidently and looks out the window at the sea.
A cool ocean breeze flows in through the open window.
The only sound around us is the lapping of the waves.
％Ｂ
「It's almost like time's stopped. I feel like I'm in a dream...」

Misa
「Isn't it a wonderful place?」
％Ｂ
「Yes... It's incredible.」
It'd be a picturesque tropical vacation if we had tropical-looking drinks with skewered fruits or something.

％Ｂ
「So have you been here a lot before?」
Misa
「My parents brought me here at around this time of year every year when I was a child. But recently...」


Misa
「After Marinpia closed down, the research stations were also to be vacated... and so the last time I visited here with my parents was to help them with the packing.」


Misa
「I wasn't able to relax like this that time. So I haven't done this since I was a child.」

Misa
「I really wanted to spend time here again. I'm very happy right now. It's like a dream of mine came true. I get to spend time like this again, in a place that I associate with so many good memories...」


％Ｂ
「A place with memories... So why did you invite me somewhere this important to you?」

Misa
「What...?」
She looks at me blankly.
Misa
「Why did I...? That's a good question... Why indeed...?」
It doesn't look like she's doing this as a joke or anything. She really seems to not understand herself why she brought me here.

％Ｂ
「Well, I just figured it was kind of as a reward for not failing my finals.」

Misa
「A reward... Hmm～ ...I feel like it may be slightly different from that...」
％Ｂ
「Then maybe you're thinking of it as a way to thank me for helping out with the Tanabata Festival preparations?」

Misa
「As thanks... Hmm...」
She's deep in thought for some reason...
It's not like I asked her a particularly intense question, though.
％Ｂ
「U-Um... You don't really need to think that hard about―」
Misa
「Oh! I know! It would be because I thought being together with you would make for the most wonderful time possible
, Ryousuke-san

!」

％Ｂ
「Wha...?」
Being together with me would make for the most wonderful time possible?
％Ｂ
「U-Um... Isn't that something that people usually say... about family members, or lovers...?」

Misa
「What? ...L-Lovers...?」
She turns bright red again.
％Ｂ
「Oh... I-I'm sorry! I wasn't saying I was like that...!」

Now my face is turning red too.
％Ｂ
「Y-You know... Because Keizou mentioned it earlier, so it must've just...」

Misa
「Y-Yes... He did say that, didn't he...」
Keizou-san teased her when we first arrived.
That she had gotten old enough to bring a boyfriend like me here.
Misa
「Keizou-san has been acquainted with my father since a long time ago. He's known me ever since I was a child. So that's why he said something like... I'm sorry for that.」


％Ｂ
「Oh no, you don't need to apologize. I understood that Keizou-san was joking when he said that too.」

％Ｂ
「And I was thinking it'd be really nice if you were my girlfriend too.」

Misa
「...Were you really?」
％Ｂ
「Yes.」
Misa
「...」
％Ｂ
「...」
...Wait, what?
...What did I just say?
I feel like I just let something pretty big slip just now...
all
Now let's think back...
％Ｂ
「...」
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaghhhhhh!?
Wha...What have I done...
What have I done!?
I told her it'd be nice if she was my girlfriend...
That's pretty much a confession!
I've gone and let something absurd slip at a time like this...
Wh-What should I do!?
N-No, wait... Calm down.
It's Okihara-senpai we're talking about. She probably didn't get what I was trying to say.
I bet I can still play this off as―
Misa
「...」
Her face is bright red!
Does that mean she understood what I meant...?
Misa
「...Um.」
She turns toward me.
％Ｂ
「...Y-Yes?」
Misa
「I don't really know how to say this... Well... Thank you very much.」
％Ｂ
「Uh... Well... Um... Yes... You're very welcome.」
Misa
「O-Oh no... L-Likewise...」
％Ｂ
「No, no... You're welcome...」
I continue to numbly continue the exchange through these weird itchy emotions.
Misa
「U-Um!?」
％Ｂ
「Y-Yes!」
Misa
「I-I'd like to ask... just to make sure...!」
Misa
「Was that... th-the truth...?」
％Ｂ
「W-Well...」
I can still turn back.
I can just laugh this off...
"Oh come on, what were you taking me seriously for?"
"It was a joke, of course." I can just play it off like that...

％Ｂ
「...」
But...
I can't lie like that.
％Ｂ
「...It was the truth.」
Misa
「Oh... I-I see... I see, I see...」


％Ｂ
「Because... I... like you.」
I feel like my breath might stop.
My throat's parched. It took everything I had just to say that.
Misa
「Th-Thank you... v-very much... It makes me very happy... to hear that.」


Okihara-senpai also replies with some effort.
And silence follows.
％Ｂ
「...Sigh.」
I can't believe I just confessed like that.
％Ｂ
「What kinda idiot am I?」
I should've known that confessing to her at a time like that would only be troublesome for her, especially in a place that's so precious to her.

She said thank you, but didn't give me any response other than that.

％Ｂ
「...I wonder what that meant?」
Though it's Okihara-senpai we're talking about.
I guess it isn't surprising at all that she'd give at least a courtesy response.
％Ｂ
「Sigh... What do I do now? ...It's gonna be hard to talk to her...」

Misa
「...」
Wait, she's coming closer herself!
She's got the diving equipment in hand.
Misa
「Shall we dive under again?」
％Ｂ
「Uh...」
Misa
「There's still time before the boat comes to pick us up... and I would like to collect a few more fish. Or would you like to stay here and wait


, Ryousuke-san

?」
Her expression and words aren't any different from usual.
I have no idea what she might think of my confession from earlier, but I definitely prefer this to her being awkward around me because of it.

％Ｂ
「Oh... Then I'll dive too.」
I'll follow her lead and act as normal as possible...
The two of us dive underwater again.
Man... The ocean's just the best.
It's like a dream under the waves.
I feel like I wanna stay underwater like this forever...
Misa
「...」
Hm?
Okihara-senpai's making some kind of signal at me. Let's see...

『Take off... your snorkel...? Toward the surface...』

...What's going on?
I hesitantly do as she says.
％Ｂ
「Glub...」
...What on earth could she want me to do this for?
Misa
「...」
She places her hand on my shoulder.
Her face suddenly comes closer to mine, and then―
％Ｂ
「...!?」
％Ｂ
「Pfah...!」
Misa
「Hah, hah, hahh... Hehe... Hehe!」

Suddenly, the sky expands above me.
Okihara-senpai's dazzling smile is before my eyes.
It looks like we surfaced with our own natural buoyancy.
Our breaths are a bit rough after surfacing.
We hold onto each other tight so we don't separate as we bob in the waves.

％Ｂ
「...Okihara-senpai... Um... What's...?」
Misa
「...I apologize for surprising you. But there's something I just had to speak with you about.」

Misa
「After I heard what you said earlier, it was so sudden I didn't understand myself how I should respond...」




％Ｂ
「It's understandable, since it was actually sudden... I'm sorry.」

Misa
「It isn't anything to apologize about! I wish I could have responded immediately... but when I thought about it, I just grew more and more confused.」


Misa
「So I thought I should just go in the ocean and calm myself.」

Misa
「And as I was slowly swimming through the ocean... I came to realize my own feelings.」

Misa
「And so I wished to clearly communicate those feelings to you.」

％Ｂ
「Oh...」
Misa
「I... feel the same way.」
Misa
「I... like you too.」
％Ｂ
「Uh... Uhh... R-Really?」

Misa
「...Yes! Really.」
％Ｂ
「I-I see... I don't know how to respond... Thank you very much...」

Misa
「...」
％Ｂ
「...」
We look into each other's eyes, kind of in a daze.
After a while of that...
％Ｂ
「...Pff.」
Misa
「...Hehe.」
We start laughing.
Misa
「A-Ahaha... Th-This is kind of silly!」
％Ｂ
「I think so too... Ahahahahaha...! It's like I'm saying the same thing you did...」

Misa
「You really are... Hehehe...」
％Ｂ
「But I feel like that's just like us...」
Misa
「You may be right. Yes, that may be...」
％Ｂ
「...Senpai.」
Misa
「...」
We stare at each other intently.
It's like I'm being sucked into her eyes.
We look into each other's eyes as if drawn together...
Misa
「...Mmh.」
And I gently kiss her.
There were no words, no confirmation... but doing that felt like the natural thing to do.

I feel like my feelings connected with hers for that instant. I can feel them fill up my heart.

Misa
「...Eheh.」
I like this person.
...I know that for sure.
Misa
「Would you like... to dive together?」
％Ｂ
「Yes. I'll follow you as deep as you'd like.」
Misa
「Then I will guide you! To the deep, blue world of the ocean. To the most wonderful place...」


We slowly sink into the sea.
I don't need my mask or snorkel anymore.
I don't feel the pain of not being able to breathe.
The sensation of being underwater disappears entirely.
The only thing I recognize is her.
I feel like I might melt away into the ocean swimming like this.
And for a moment, I think that might be okay.
Anywhere is fine if it's with her.
The ocean really is the best.
It's like something out of a dream.
I want to stay underwater together, forever.
$$smh_OpenCHK
％Ｂ
「Keizou-san should be coming to pick us up soon...」
Misa
「Yes... You're right.」
We've packed up, and we're waiting for the boat home.
％Ｂ
「To be honest, I really don't want to leave.」
Misa
「Have you taken a liking to this island?」
％Ｂ
「There's that... but it's more that I want to be alone together with you for longer.」

Misa
「Oh... Yes, that's true... I may not want to leave yet either, in that sense.」

％Ｂ
「Maybe we should just stay here, then?」
Misa
「Yes, that sounds wonderful!」
We're joking around like this, but of course we know we can't actually stay.

Misa
「...Will you come with me again?」
％Ｂ
「Yes. For sure.」
I say it clearly, and gently take her by the―
Misa
「Oh... It seems I'm being called.」
all
％Ｂ
「...」
...I couldn't hold her hand.
W-Well, I guess I'll just have to wait until the next opportunity...
Misa
「Hello? This is Misa. Oh... Keizou-san?」
Looks like it's Keizou-san who called.
Misa
「Yes. Yes... What? ...The boat won't start?」

％Ｂ
「Uh...」
Misa
「Engine troubles... It won't start at all?」
You've gotta be kidding me...
Misa
「Is there another boat you could... Yes... Yes... I see... Well if that's the case... Yes... Yes, we should be fine... Yes... Then please...」


Misa
「...It seems we have an issue.」
％Ｂ
「I more or less understand the situation. The boat won't start?」

Misa
「It seems so. It seems he is experiencing engine troubles.」


％Ｂ
「Then maybe someone else could come pick us up instead?」
Misa
「Unfortunately... it appears today was a youth association gathering, and there is no fishing tomorrow, so it seems everyone has already drunk a considerable amount of alcohol...」


％Ｂ
「Wha... S-So... You mean...?」
Misa
「It appears they will be coming to pick us up tomorrow.」
％Ｂ
「Wha... Are you serious!?」
She nods apologetically.
Misa
「...What should we do?」
％Ｂ
「What should we... It seems there's nothing we can do... It seems we'll just have to spend the night here on this island at this point.」


Misa
「Was this because the two of us said that we didn't wish to leave...?」

％Ｂ
「If it is... Our wishing is way too powerful...」
all
We look over the research station's facilities.
Like I already heard when we got here, there's a bed for researchers staying the night.

You can take baths too, so staying the night shouldn't be too bad.

％Ｂ
「We still have ingredients left over, so we should be able to do something about dinner too...」
Misa
「Yes... And so we will have to stay on the island...」
She's calling her family while I'm checking the food.
Misa
「Yes... It should be fine, since I've stayed the night here before... and I'm also with a friend, so...」

She glances at me.
...I wonder what that was about.
Misa
「Yes... I will call you if anything happens. Then...」
％Ｂ
「Is everything okay?」
Misa
「Yes. My parents and I have stayed the night here previously, so they are not too concerned.」


％Ｂ
「I see... Oh, but do they know you're here with me...?」
Misa
「I've only told them I'm with a friend. I'm sure they must think that I'm with another girl...」

％Ｂ
「...Yes, probably.」
Misa
「I-I haven't lied, have I?」
％Ｂ
「Of course not! We've got nothing to hide!」
Misa
「E-Exactly... Right?」
Circumstances aside, she's still alone together with a guy on an uninhabited island...
She's trying her best to not think about that.
Misa
「In any case, Keizou-san will apparently be coming to pick us up tomorrow morning... so we will simply have to spend the night here.」


％Ｂ
「Y-Yes, you're right. Then... shall we make dinner?」

Misa
「What shall we cook?」
％Ｂ
「...Curry.」
'Cause that's all we've got the ingredients for...
all
I set up the bed that I've pulled out of storage.
％Ｂ
「There's only one bed here...」
Misa
「Y-Yes... There used to be sheets too, but we removed all of them when we packed things up previously...」

And so the two of us are lying in a single bed.

％Ｂ
「Um... Maybe I should sleep in a different room after all?」
Misa
「No... that would be...」
％Ｂ
「But I don't really know if...」
I'm happy about this, but I think I'm gonna be too nervous to sleep.
％Ｂ
「You know, I think I'll sleep in a different room.」
She grabs my arm as I get up.
Misa
「Please don't go!」
％Ｂ
「Huh?」
Misa
「I-I... um... I can't handle... being alone...」
％Ｂ
「Uhh... You don't happen to be afraid of ghosts and stuff, do you?」
Misa
「P-Please don't talk about... ghosts and such...」
Oh, yep. She is.
Misa
「I-I'm fine at home... but in a place like this... it's just, well...」

％Ｂ
「You're scared?」
Misa
「...Yes.」
Seems I've found yet another new side of her.
％Ｂ
「I understand... I'll stay here, then.」
Misa
「Th-Thank you very much.」
So she's afraid of ghosts.
That's pretty cute of her...

We were able to return to the mainland the next day.
Keizou
「I'm sorry about yesterday, you two. She just wouldn't do as I said. There weren't any issues when I took you two out here, but...」


Misa
「Do you know what the cause was?」
Keizou
「That's the thing. She started up just like usual this morning. The repairman didn't have a clue either.」

Misa
「Oh really... That's rather strange.」
％Ｂ
「...」
...It better not actually be because the two of us were wishing we didn't have to leave yesterday...
all
Keizou
「More importantly, young man! No mistakes last night, I hope?」

％Ｂ
「Wh-What do you mean by mistakes?」
Keizou
「I'm asking if you made any mistakes you shouldn't have just 'cause it was the two of you alone!」
％Ｂ
「I-I wouldn't do that!」
Keizou
「Well, Misa-chan?」
Misa
「He's telling the truth. 
Ryousuke-san 
He 
is a gentleman, so he was very kind to me.」
all
Keizou
「Hm... Well, that's good, then.」
％Ｂ
「Y-Yes... Then, thank you very much. Now let's go, Senpai.」

Misa
「Yes.」
She brings her lips to my ear as she lifts her bags and whispers.

Misa
「It seems I've told a lie... Hehe.」
％Ｂ
「...」
all
I wonder what she means by a lie?
Is she talking about how she didn't tell Keizou-san that something actually did happen last night?

Or...
...That maybe I wasn't a gentleman?
