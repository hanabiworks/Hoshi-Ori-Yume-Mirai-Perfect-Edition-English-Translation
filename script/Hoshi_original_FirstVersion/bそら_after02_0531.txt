「Hmm... Mmh...」
I've got my head on my desk, trying to think.
The sun's gone down. It's pitch black out.
And the drafting board before me is stark white...
I've been to the Azuma Architectural Firm several times since that first time I went to go show Azuma-san those rough sketches back in the beginning of May, but he's rejected everything every time.


I can't tell if my designs are bad, or if I just don't understand what a cultural hall even is...

Sora
「...Found you.」
％Ｂ
「...Hm? Oh, Sora. Done with work?」
Sora
「...*nod* Have you eaten?」
％Ｂ
「No, not yet... I probably should.」
Sora
「I thought so, so I bought some food. Let's eat together.」
She holds up a paper bag from the burger shop.
all
Sora
「How's work?」
％Ｂ
「Well... To be honest, I'm totally stuck... Azuma-san's not giving me the okay for anything.」
Sora
「Really. Anything I can help with?」
％Ｂ
「It's encouraging enough just that you came here, and I don't feel as depressed anymore.」

Sora
「...That makes me happy to hear. But it's always been you helping me.」

％Ｂ
「You've been helping me too. Like how we can eat tasty food together like this.」

Sora
「...I should've cooked something to bring instead of buying hamburgers.」

％Ｂ
「No, burgers are fine. Eating these with you just kinda feels right.」

Sora
「...You showed me how tasty they are.」
Sora
「...You showed me how tasty they are.」
She smiles softly and bites into her burger.
─But then she freezes up.
％Ｂ
「You didn't get them to take out the pickles?」
Sora
「...*shake shake* I did for one. That's probably the one without pickles.」

She points at my burger with teary eyes.
She then silently points her bitten-into burger at me.

The way we still do this even after so many years really soothes my heart.
％Ｂ
「...Oh, right. I could always go back to square one.」
Sora
「?」
％Ｂ
「Thanks, Sora. I've thought of a good way of doing things thanks to you.」
Sora
「Did I do something?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, you did. So I've got somewhere I wanna go tomorrow. Can you come with?」


Sora
「...Where?」
％Ｂ
「Shionagi First Academy.」

The next day.
Sora and I head to our alma mater.
I hand over my business card at the front office, explain to them that I'm in charge of designing the new cultural hall, and get permission to enter the school.

There aren't any classes because it's Saturday.
Sora and I walk together down the silent halls.
％Ｂ
「This sure takes me back. We've been outside the school a lot after we graduated, but how long's it been since we actually went inside?」

Sora
「...Ahh...」
％Ｂ
「Hm? What's up?」
Sora
「...It's really nostalgic.」
Sora
「And being here with you makes me feel like I'm in high school again.」

Sora
「And being here with you makes me feel like I'm in high school again.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, that's true. Maybe we should've brought uniforms too?」
Sora
「...Cosplay?」
％Ｂ
「Is what that'd be at our age, yeah.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
Sora
「But why are we here?」
％Ｂ
「I was thinking I'd try going back to the start of it all. Standing here in the place where we spent so much time back then might let me catch a glimpse of what the cultural hall should be.」


％Ｂ
「Let's walk around the school a bit while we're here.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「Ohh, it's still the same.」
Sora
「...Nostalgic.」
％Ｂ
「It's the classroom I transferred into. I remember how Segawa took a photo of me out of nowhere. Man, this is so nostalgic.」

Sora
「Where was your seat?」
Sora
「Where was your seat?」
％Ｂ
「My seat was... Let's see, right here. And Narusawa sat next to me.」

Sora
「...Ritsu-sensei.」
％Ｂ
「That's right. I guess she's just 100 percent a teacher for you now?」
Sora
「...*nod* I wouldn't have been able to do the planetarium if Ritsu hadn't taught me so much.」

％Ｂ
「You mean the one for the Tanabata Festival, right? The old school building we worked in back then's gone now, and I'm gonna design a new building in its place.」


％Ｂ
「It's a place for something to be born, and grow... Mhm, that's a good concept.」

％Ｂ
「The second chemistry classroom... The fish tanks aren't here anymore.」
Sora
「The naturalist club wasn't an active club in the year I graduated.」
％Ｂ
「Really? That's a shame...」
Sora
「...But I have lots of memories of this room.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah... Yeah, you really believed that there were shady experiments being done here. You were actually afraid of coming in here.」


Sora
「...That happened too.」
Sora
「But something more important happened.」
％Ｂ
「Which was?」
Sora
「This is where you persuaded Misa and me to reconsider. I wouldn't be who I am now without those words from back then.」

Sora
「This is where you persuaded Misa and me to reconsider. I wouldn't be who I am now without those words from back then.」

Sora
「I probably would've been watching the stars all by myself, all this time.」
％Ｂ
「I was pretty desperate back then.」
Sora
「That was why you were able to move our hearts. I could never be grateful enough to you, Ryou.」

Sora
「That was why you were able to move our hearts. I could never be grateful enough to you.」

％Ｂ
「I remember I bothered you while you were reading here once.」
Sora
「You weren't a bother.」
％Ｂ
「But it was an unwritten rule among your friends that they wouldn't try to talk to you when you were reading, right?」

Sora
「That was just my friends trying to be considerate about my interests. It wasn't a bother, and that's why I responded to you back then.」

Sora
「That was just my friends trying to be considerate about my interests. It wasn't a bother, and that's why I responded to you back then.」

％Ｂ
「That's true.」
Sora
「...This is nostalgic too. It's where you gave me honey mustard.」
Sora
「...This is nostalgic too. It's where you gave me honey mustard.」
％Ｂ
「...Oh yeah, that... It's kinda embarrassing to remember, 'cause I really felt like I messed that joke up.」


Sora
「But it tasted good.」
％Ｂ
「It went better with that yakisoba bread than expected.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
The memories all come flooding back just from walking around.
I realize just how many memories Sora and I piled together here in this school.

％Ｂ
「...I know. Wanna try going up to the roof?」
It's the spot that's filled with more memories than any other for us.
Sora
「...Can we really go to the roof?」
％Ｂ
「The school knows about the cultural hall plan, so I think I can just say I wanna go up to the roof to get a view of the overall scene.」

％Ｂ
「Still though, knocking on the faculty office really reminds me of back when we were students.」

all
I feel a strange sense of exhilaration as I lift my hand to knock.
Rikka
「...Oh, you two...」
％Ｂ
「...What?」
Sora
「...?」
We turn around to see─
Rikka
「Hino-kun, and Ousaka-san?」
Rikka
「...Aren't you...?」
％Ｂ
「Narusawa!?」
Sora
「Ritsu...?」
Rikka
「What are you doing here?」
％Ｂ
「Huh? Oh, just something for work. I'm in charge of the design for the cultural hall that's being built where the old school building used to be. What are you doing here, Narusawa?」


Rikka
「I'm here for work too. I'm a contract music teacher here.」
％Ｂ
「Really!?」
Sora
「...Ritsu-sensei...」
％Ｂ
「You're right, she's an actual teacher now.」
Rikka
「Hearing you call me that is really nostalgic, Ousaka-san.」
％Ｂ
「Since when have you been teaching music here?」
Rikka
「Since spring this year. I'm here temporarily to take over for the full-time music teacher while she's on maternity leave.」

％Ｂ
「Really... Man, this takes me back so much. It's been forever.」


Sora
「...I'm glad to see you again, Ritsu.」
Rikka
「Yes, same for me. I never would've thought I'd run into old friends here at school.」

％Ｂ
「Still though, you're a teacher, huh.」
Rikka
「Do you think it doesn't fit?」
％Ｂ
「No, it just kinda makes sense. It doesn't seem strange at all, weirdly enough.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
Rikka
「I might've become a teacher because of you two.」
％Ｂ
「Because of us...? Why's that?」
Rikka
「It might be because you showed me that teaching others something is fun and worthwhile.」

Sora
「...I'm a planetarium navigator even now thanks to you. I'm sure you have talent for teaching.」

Rikka
「Really. I guess that makes you student number one for me, then.」

Sora
「...*nod*」
Rikka
「By the way, what did you need from the faculty office?」
％Ｂ
「Oh, we wanted to borrow the key to the rooftop.」
all
I slowly open the heavy steel door, and squint as bright light filters through the gap.
And in the next instant, I feel a surge of nostalgia.\n\r
I feel the clear smell of the breeze I can't feel down on the ground.
％Ｂ
「...Phew...」
I feel a surge of emotion that would only be cheapened by calling it nostalgia.
I wonder if Sora feels the same way.
She's smiling, looking across the rooftop.
This rooftop has to be the most familiar spot in the entire school for the two of us.

Sora
「...Eleven years...」
％Ｂ
「Hm?」
Sora
「...I met you again eleven years today.」
Sora
「...I met you again eleven years today.」
％Ｂ
「...Today... Oh, you're right. It's May 31st...!」
It's the day I returned to Shionagi.
I was walking up to the school to take a look before I transferred. I picked up a star-shaped tanzaku after it had fallen from the roof, and I came here to return it.

And that was when I met a slightly eccentric girl who wore polarized sunglasses and a hood.

％Ｂ
「That's right... May 31st. I met you here, for the second time, eleven years ago today.」

Sora
「You forgot?」
％Ｂ
「Uh... I remembered, but I didn't think it was today.」
Sora
「...That's the same as forgetting.」
％Ｂ
「...I-I'm very sorry.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
Sora
「...No issues.」
Sora
「I remember every memory I've had with you, Ryou. We'll always be together, so I can remind you anytime.」

Sora
「I remember every memory I've had with you. We'll always be together, so I can remind you anytime.」

％Ｂ
「That's true... Thanks. But I remember lots of things too, you know.」

％Ｂ
「We watched the stars so many times from up here. Getting lap pillows from you while we stargazed was the best.」

Sora
「You fell asleep halfway through, though.」
％Ｂ
「This was also where I ate your star cookies for the first time.」
Sora
「You confessed to me after that.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, but you deferred your response.」
Sora
「But it made me happy.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah... And you gave me your response here too.」
Sora
「...*nod*
This is also where we had our first kiss.」
She smiles a little bashfully and holds my hand.
I squeeze her hand firmly.
I close my eyes and take a deep breath, feeling the warmth of her hand in mine.

It's been eleven years since then... Sora and I have been together ever since.

The old school building we used to be able to see from up here's nowhere to be found now.
But the time we spent here...
The memories, they're all still here.
And they're all various starting points toward our dreams.
％Ｂ
「...It was a good idea to come here.」
Sora
「...Do you think you'll think of a good idea?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. It's thanks to you, Sora. I've remembered a lot of things.」
Sora
「...I'm glad.」
She smiles happily.
