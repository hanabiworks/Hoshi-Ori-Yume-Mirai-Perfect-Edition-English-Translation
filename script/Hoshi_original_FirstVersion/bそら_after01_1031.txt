Azuma
「As you all know, Hino's going to be leaving our firm as of today.」

Azuma
「As you all know, this guy's going to be leaving our firm as of today.」

％Ｂ
「...」
Today's my last day at the Azuma Architectural Firm.
Azuma-san's put on a modest, but thoughtful going-away party for me at the firm.

Azuma
「He's not quitting because I fired him after a mistake, or because he got handsy with one of the female clients and finds this place too awkward now. It's a happy parting.」


Everyone laughs at Azuma-san's words.
But then he clears his throat, drops his smile, and looks at me.

Azuma
「It's been almost ten years since Hino first came here. He tried to get himself an internship here, even though he wasn't even in university at that point.」


Azuma
「It's been almost ten years since this guy first came here. He tried to get himself an internship here, even though he wasn't even in university at that point.」


Azuma
「I turned him down, though. But then he came knocking on my door again afterward, and he's been working hard for me ever since.」

Azuma
「I doubt there's any need to name the things he's left behind for us at this firm. Everyone, whether they're senior or junior staff here, acknowledges and appreciates him.」


Azuma
「Including me, of course.」
％Ｂ
「Wha...?」
Azuma
「It's going to be painful for us to have this guy quit. But I want everyone to cover for his absence and do their best. He won't be able to leave with a clear conscience otherwise.」


％Ｂ
「Teacher...」
...Why do you have to say stuff like that now?
You're making my eyes feel kinda hot...
Azuma
「Though fortunately, our new hires are coming along well too, so I'm sure we'll manage. Take your first steps forward into your new life without any worries. That's all from me.」

Junior Firm Staff
「Now then, a toast for Senpai turning the page to a new chapter of his life! Does everyone have their glasses? Let's all celebrate him becoming independent from the firm... Cheers!」


Firm Staff
「Cheers!」
％Ｂ
「Thank you very much!」
I lower my head to all of the firm staff, starting with Azuma-san.

Junior Firm Staff
「Ghhh, Senpai! I'm gonna be lonely when you're gone! There's still so much I wanted to learn from you...」

％Ｂ
「What the heck, man. Drunk already?」
Junior Firm Staff
「I'm serious here!」
Firm Staff A
「Good luck once you're independent.」
Firm Staff B
「Things are going to be lonely around here once you're gone.」
Junior Firm Staff
「Please come by again sometime! We'll welcome you with open arms!」
％Ｂ
「Thank you very much. I'll come by whenever I can.」
Azuma
「Hey, Hino. Can I talk with you?」
Azuma
「Hey. Can I talk with you?」
％Ｂ
「Oh, yes. What is it?」
Azuma-san beckons me over to the far side of the room.
Azuma
「Here. It's a farewell gift.」
％Ｂ
「Wha...? I've already gotten my leave pay, though.」
Azuma
「This is separate from that. This is personal. Put it away already.」
％Ｂ
「No, but...」
Azuma
「Just shut up and take it. It's not like it'll be a bother, right?」
％Ｂ
「...That's true, but...」
Azuma
「Once you're independent, you'll need money. That should help you out at least a little. If you don't need it, then use it to take Sora-chan out on a vacation, or use it for your wedding.」


％Ｂ
「Teacher...」
Azuma
「Come to me if you're ever in trouble. Got it?」
％Ｂ
「Yes... Thank you very much... Teacher...」
