Touko
「...」

％Ｂ
「What's wrong? You're just staring off into nowhere... You feeling sick or something?」
Touko
「Oh, no, I'm fine. I was just thinking about something. Sorry about that.」
We're on another date today.
It's a little past 1 p.m. We just got done having a relaxed lunch.
Touko's been like this all day.
She showed up late for once, and she's been out of it ever since our date started... It's like her mind's been elsewhere the entire day.

％Ｂ
「Well, as long as you aren't feeling sick or anything. It's pretty hot today. Wanna take a break somewhere cool?」

She's clearly down for some reason... I'm worried.
I think she might be tired or something.
Touko
「Mm, I'm okay. Anyway... could you tell me about your dreams?」

％Ｂ
「Huh? I've told you already, haven't I?」
Touko
「It's fine, isn't it? I wanna hear a little more about your dreams.」
％Ｂ
「...Sure, but you better not laugh, all right? I'm pretty sure this is gonna end up sounding pretty embarrassing.」

I search through my heart.
I look for the feelings at the core of my dream―to become an architect.
％Ｂ
「I think it's amazing to be able to make people smile. And not just that, but reassure them and move their hearts... I wanna help support those feelings.」


％Ｂ
「I looked into a lot of things, and found out about architects. I've been studying for a long time, ever since I decided to become an architect. I still want to be one now just as much... no, even more than I did before.」


％Ｂ
「I wanna make a place that's fun, and warm... and comfortable, where people always smile. I wanna become an architect who can support other people's smiles. I'm doing my best now so I can make that dream come true.」


Touko
「...」
％Ｂ
「...Come on, it's embarrassing when you don't say anything like that...」
Touko
「No, I was just thinking about how amazing it is. You have a proper dream and a road you want to move along.」

all
She steps away from my side and starts walking toward the sea.
For some reason... it feels like she might just melt away into the water and disappear.

Touko
「I'm sure... people will forget. Because it isn't possible for something to stay the same forever.」

％Ｂ
「What?」
Touko
「Like Jellyfish-senpai's aquarium, for example... No matter how nice a building it is, it still might become something that only exists in the memories of the people who live in Shionagi and in records, and... disappear.」


％Ｂ
「Touko...?」
Touko
「Disappear, as if it had never existed in the first place. So then... was there a point to it being there at all?」

It'd be easy enough to deny what she's saying.
...But is there any point in just trying to console her with empty words when I don't even know what's at the root of this?

Touko
「...Sorry. Forget that just now.」
I walk toward her and take her hand.
If words won't work, then I can use my actions.
Touko
「...Your hand's so warm
, Ryousuke-kun

.」
％Ｂ
「Your hand's a bit cold. It's perfect for me, since it's a bit hot.」
Her hand... is trembling just a little in mine.
I wrap my hands around hers, to push away the doubts she's holding in her heart.

％Ｂ
「You can depend on me. I don't know how much help I'll be... but I wanna be there for you as much as possible.」

Touko
「...Mhm.」

％Ｂ
「From the architectural firm...? Mr. Azuma?」

％Ｂ
「Yes, hello?」
Azuma
『I have something I wanted to ask you about. I want a student's opinion on something, so could you come by sometime in the near future?』

％Ｂ
「You want a student's opinion? Yes, I understand. I'll check to see when I can, and get back to you as soon as possible.」

Azuma
『That'd be great. No need to rush. Just come by when you're free.』

_smh_st_04
Touko
「Was that from Mr. Azuma?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. He says he wants a student's opinion on something. I'll make plans to go when I've got a break between committee work.」


Touko
「You should just go now. We don't have any plans for what we're doing after this anyway, and talking to your teacher about work is important, isn't it?」

％Ｂ
「Huh? But...」
Touko
「You need to treasure your dreams. Don't you think you should work hard for those, instead of some pointless date?」

％Ｂ
「Th-Then how about you come with me? He said he wanted a student's opinion, so having more should...」

Touko
「Mmm... I can't. I'd just be in the way, and I'd fall asleep when I get bored. It'd be rude to your teacher.」


％Ｂ
「No, that's not...」
Touko
「It's fine, it's fine. We were together all day yesterday, and we'll see each other again tomorrow. You don't have to worry about me.」


all
Azuma
「...I thought I said you didn't need to rush to come here.」
％Ｂ
「Well, it's a bit of a long story... I was on a date with Touko, and she just told me to go now and sent me on my way.」

Azuma
「And you came here by yourself after that? Why didn't Touko-chan come with you?」

％Ｂ
「I asked her if she wanted to... but she said she wouldn't be useful even if she came.」
Azuma
「...Let me tell you something. I know I asked you to come here and all, but a man who makes a woman lonely will never be able to do satisfying work.」


％Ｂ
「Gh... I-I'll bear that in mind.」
Azuma
「I'll talk to you about something before we get to stuff for work. Listen up. A man should always carry both work and his woman in his heart, no matter where he goes. When I was your age...」

「...Hello? Touko?」
Touko
『...Mm. What's wrong?』
％Ｂ
「Sorry about today. How I left in the middle of our date.」
Touko
『You don't have to worry about it. I was the one who told you to go.』
％Ｂ
「Yeah, but Mr. Azuma was angry with me. He said a man who makes a woman lonely isn't someone who can do good work.」

Touko
『Ahaha, he sure is different, isn't he? The way he thinks is just as show-offish as he looks.』

％Ｂ
「Wha, is that a show-off's way of thinking!? I totally took it to heart!」

Touko
『Specifically the way he says "a woman." I'm sure he's done his fair share of mischief too.』

％Ｂ
「...Anyway, that aside. I gotta make it up to you. You might be fine with it, but I'm not.」

Touko
『...Okay. I'll be waiting.』
％Ｂ
「Let me talk it over in detail with you tomorrow. We can set up a date plan while we're doing committee work.」

Touko
『...Mm, yeah.』
％Ｂ
「...Touko? You listening to me?」
Touko
『Mm? Mhm, I'm listening. Ahaha, maybe I'm a bit sleepy.』

％Ｂ
「My bad, let's get to bed, then. Night, Touko.」

Touko
『...Mm. Night.』
_smh_st_04
...She sure was out of it today.
I'll ask her about it again tomorrow.
