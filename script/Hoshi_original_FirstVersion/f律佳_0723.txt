Natsuki
「It's a shame Rikka couldn't come～」
％Ｂ
「Uuuughh... I beg you, don't make me any sadder than I already am.」
all
The concert team's continuing its meetings with the guest performers for the Shio-cademy Fest.

Everyone on the team is apparently especially busy with that today, which means she won't be able to come help us today.

Touko
「It's boring for me without Piano-chan here too...」
Yukimura's sitting on a desk, swinging her legs.

Misa
「Yes. Perhaps it's because we have been together so often lately. It feels as if something is missing.」

all
Marika
「Narusawa-san's really interesting. She was so distant a month ago, but now she's really easy to talk to. Hino-kun, maybe you changed her?」
Marika
「Narusawa-san's really interesting. She was so distant a month ago, but now she's really easy to talk to. Maybe you changed her?」
％Ｂ
「I... No, I think it's more like Rikka's always had that side to her.」

％Ｂ
「The person who always played piano alone after school was Rikka, and the person who's with us all the time is Rikka too.」

Marika
「I get it～ Mhm, you're right.」
all
Sora
「...We're always connected.」
Ousaka's holding up her phone, with the handmade Saturn strap from yesterday attached.

％Ｂ
「Thanks, Ousaka.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
all
Rikka's doing her best. I should do the same.
But... there's still something I'm a little worried about.
Rikka seemed depressed yesterday.
And judging from when I saw her this morning, it doesn't look like the issue's been resolved.
But still, I won't solve anything by worrying about it.
I should take on what's in front of me for now, one thing at a time.
％Ｂ
「I'm almost done with the placement diagram, so let's get started on really planning out the layout once that's finished.」

I'm currently drafting out a blueprint for Shionagi's celestial bodies.
It involves calculating the most efficient and precise placement of stars to be displayed on the limited space of the ceiling of the second chemistry classroom.

It's a scaled map of symbols, numbers, and star names, with aspect ratio and the presence of the room's corner pillars all accounted for.
The symbols correspond to stars and constellations we definitely want to be able to show, and those that aren't high priority, selected with Ousaka's input.

The blueprint looks similar to something you might see in architecture.
Who would've thought my architectural studies would come in handy here? This is why being diligent about studying is important.

Natsuki
「This really looks like something made by a professional. You're amazing.」
％Ｂ
「I still have a long way to go.」
Especially since I wasn't able to get Mr. Azuma's approval.
Though I don't have the slightest intention of giving up because of that.
％Ｂ
「And same goes for you with that camera, Segawa.」
Natsuki
「I'm nowhere close to good yet. I'm still pretty much a hobbyist. Seeing photos taken by a master of the craft gets me emotional, and also depressed 'cause they show me just how much I still have to learn.」


％Ｂ
「So that kinda stuff happens to you too?」
Natsuki
「Of course it does. Do you know that photo studio in the marketplace?」

％Ｂ
「Yeah... The one with the wedding photos put up on display?」
Natsuki
「The owner of that place is a famous photographer. She's amazingly good at capturing people's expressions.」

Natsuki
「I guess you could say her photos could make a crying kid smile? I just wanna be able to take amazing photos like that too someday, you know?」

％Ｂ
「I think you can do it, Segawa.」
Natsuki
「Don't try to console me.」
％Ｂ
「I'm not. I think you could do it with that bright and assertive personality of yours.」

Natsuki
「Really. I'll accept the compliment, then. Maybe I'll have you build my photography studio if I make it as a professional.」


％Ｂ
「Looks like I'll have to work hard so I can do that, then.」
all
We're talking casually, but we both have goals that we're fixated on.
Ousaka's got the stars, and Okihara-senpai's got the ocean.
all
Shinozaki's doing her best now after suffering through her asthma when she was a kid.
And Yukimura's enjoying her life exactly the way she wants to.
all
And likewise, Rikka's got the piano...
Memories of her playing suddenly come to mind.
She must like playing the piano.
But it feels like that's not everything there is to it...
Meguru
「Oh, Senpai! I'm so glad to see you～」
％Ｂ
「What? Meguru-chan?」
Meguru-chan's standing in the doorway, looking relieved to see me.
Meguru
「Umm～ ...Where am I?」
all
Meguru
「Oh, I see. So this is where all of you are doing your preparations for the Tanabata Festival.」

Meguru-chan's looking around the classroom with great interest.
She apparently got lost when she came to find Rikka.
％Ｂ
「Yeah, this school's pointlessly huge. I can see how you'd get lost.」
Meguru
「I had someone guide me to where I needed to go from the entrance gates yesterday, so I don't really remember the layout.」

Meguru
「There wasn't even anyone to ask, and in the depths of my despair, I saw you, Senpai! is what it was like. I'm really glad you were here.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, I'm glad you happened to walk by. There aren't really that many people here in the building with the special classrooms.」

Meguru
「I seem to be bad with directions. I used to make Onee-chan and my parents worry a lot in the past. I always try to give myself plenty of time to find my way when going somewhere for the first time.」
Touko
「Hey, who is this? I feel like I've seen her before...」
all
Natsuki
「I feel like I've seen her too. Just recently.」
Marika
「She kind of resembles Narusawa-san...?」
％Ｂ
「She's her little sister.」
all
Meguru
「I apologize for the late introduction. I'm Onee-cha...Narusawa Rikka's younger sister, Narusawa Meguru. Pleased to meet you.」

She gives a proper bow.
Natsuki
「Rikka's little sister... Oh! The pianist!」
Touko
「She's the girl on the poster at the CD shop!」
Sora
「...She's famous?」
Meguru
「Ahaha... How very embarrassing...」
The others all introduce themselves, and we all immediately stop caring about work.
It's probably just as much because of Meguru-chan's personality as it is because she's a friend's sibling.

Touko
「You're a pretty normal girl in the flesh. You don't seem like a world-renowned pianist at all.」

％Ｂ
「Yukimura, don't be rude.」
Meguru
「I don't mind. It would make me happier if you could interact with me as a normal girl. It stresses me out when people are really careful around me. Ehehe.」

all
Natsuki
「I'll go ahead and just call you Meguru then.」
Meguru
「Okay! Please do!」
％Ｂ
「Anyway, Meguru-chan. Rikka's busy today, so I don't think you'll be able to see her. You didn't know?」

all
Meguru
「Oh... Really. I didn't make any prior agreements with her today. I just came by because I wanted to see her while I had a break from work...」

She slumps down.
Rikka's probably in the middle of a meeting right now.
Hmm～ I'd feel kinda bad to have her go home like this.
all
％Ｂ
「Hey, guys. You mind if I duck out for about an hour? I'm thinking of giving Meguru-chan a tour of the school.」

Marika
「Oh, yeah! I think that sounds great!」

Misa
「I think that would be a very good idea! We will continue working on our own, then!」

Sora
「...I'm going to make more stars.」
all
％Ｂ
「Okay. Thank you very much. Are you free, Meguru-chan?」
Meguru
「I am... but isn't this a bother for you?」
％Ｂ
「Well, you're already here, and I also want you to learn more about the school Rikka and all of us go to.」

Meguru
「Oh... Okay! Thank you very much for offering to lead me on this tour!」
％Ｂ
「We were in the special classrooms building earlier, and this is the building where we normally have classes.」
Meguru
「It seems like the classrooms still feel the same way even after moving onto high school. I'm feeling a little nostalgic.」

％Ｂ
「You moved overseas before you got to go to a Japanese high school, didn't you?」

Meguru
「Yes. I left my school partway through to go to Austria. I studied under a teacher for a little bit over there, and I now work in and around Salzburg.」

％Ｂ
「It's amazing that you're doing so much at your age.」
Meguru
「I'm not very impressive. There were students much younger than me studying abroad at the Paris conservatory.」

％Ｂ
「Huh...」
Meguru
「...But I ended up doing something terrible to Onee-chan because of that...」

She sounds like she's talking to herself, but I could hear what she said clearly.
Meguru
「Could we move to the next area?」
％Ｂ
「Oh, sure. Let's go.」
I guide Meguru-chan through as many interesting spots in our school as I can in the time I have.
She sounded interested in anything and everything I had to say about every spot I took her to.

％Ｂ
「This is the inner courtyard. There's no one here because it's summer break, but it's usually filled with people eating lunch during lunch break.」

Meguru
「Do you and Onee-chan usually eat here?」
％Ｂ
「We always eat in one of the music classrooms.」
Meguru
「In... a music classroom?」
％Ｂ
「Rikka doesn't really seem to like places with a lot of people, and I feel more relaxed when it's just us two anyway.」

Meguru
「The two of you eating lunch, alone together... With no one else around...」
Meguru
「...There's no way it'd end with just feeding each other... You two are lovers, spending all of lunch break alone together, so...」

％Ｂ
「No, come on. We don't do anything at school!」
Meguru
「At school?」
％Ｂ
「Uh... Uhh...」
Crap... I'm just disclosing it all myself at this point.
Meguru
「Speaking of which, I slept in Onee-chan's bed with her the day before yesterday, and I smelled a little of something that was different from Onee-chan's scent.」

％Ｂ
「...」
Meguru
「Please excuse me... Sniff sniff.」
She brings her face up to my neck and sniffs.
She sniffs the same way Rikka does.
I feel like a suspect being interrogated by the police...
A cold sweat drips down my spine.
Meguru
「...It's the same smell. Senpai... You were in Onee-chan's bed, weren't you?」
％Ｂ
「U-Uhh...」
She's not so young that I could just tell her we were playing around while lying in bed.

Meguru-chan's already well aware of what it means for me to be in her bed.
Which means that if she knows what I've done, then that means Rikka's younger sister would know what Rikka's been doing...

I'm sorry about this, Rikka.
％Ｂ
「...Yes... I stayed over.」
Meguru
「I can't believe you would stay the night with her when her family was out of the house...」
％Ｂ
「I'm sorry.」
Meguru
「You're a pervert, Senpai. Perv-senpai.」
％Ｂ
「I do not have any words with which I can defend myself.」
All I can do is bow my head and apologize before her glare.

Meguru
「...But it's not like I have the right to say that.」
It happened again.
Meguru-chan's sad expression looks just like Rikka's from yesterday.

I think Meguru-chan must be what's on Rikka's mind.
Something must have happened since they reunited...
No. That seemed like it was something deeper.
％Ｂ
「Did something happen between you and Rikka? She's been acting weird since yesterday.」

Meguru
「...I know why. And I know that I'm the cause for that.」
Meguru
「There was a suggestion during our meeting that the two of us could play together. But Onee-chan said she wanted some time to think it over...」

Meguru
「Onee-chan will never play with me.」
％Ｂ
「How do you know that for sure?」
Meguru
「Because it's like I just said. I'm the cause. I made Onee-chan like that...」

Meguru
「Would you like to know why Onee-chan doesn't want to play?」

％Ｂ
「I do.」
％Ｂ
「But I won't ask you.」
Meguru
「Wha...?」
％Ｂ
「Rikka said she wanted to think about it for a bit. So I'm going to wait until she talks to me.」

％Ｂ
「Wouldn't be fair if I heard about it from you first, right?」
Meguru
「But with Onee-chan's personality, she might not ever tell you.」

％Ｂ
「She will. She's changed.」
％Ｂ
「Though I guess if she doesn't end up telling me, then that just means I'm not a dependable enough boyfriend.」

％Ｂ
「If that happens, I'll try my best to change things around so she'll talk to me about it.」

Meguru
「Ehehe. You sure love Onee-chan, don't you, Senpai?」
％Ｂ
「It's a bit embarrassing to hear that right to my face. But yeah, I do.」
Meguru
「I'm glad that she has someone like you as her boyfriend...」
Meguru
「Please. If Onee-chan asks for help, then please help her. Because I can't do anything...」

Meguru
「I would do anything to help her.」
％Ｂ
「...Meguru-chan. Okay. I will.」
％Ｂ
「But girls shouldn't say that they'd do anything just like that, okay?」
Meguru
「Yes, you're right. Thank you very much. Oh... It's almost time.」

Meguru
「Could you please show me the music classroom before I leave? I'd like to see the place where you and Onee-chan always flirt. Ehe.」

％Ｂ
「Meguru-chan!!」
The music classroom's empty.
The light of sunset illuminates the covered piano.
Meguru
「So this is where you and Onee-chan get all flirty... Or maybe where you get all dirty...?」

％Ｂ
「Just stop with that already!」
Meguru
「Onee-chan always plays piano here, doesn't she?」
％Ｂ
「I think she pretty much played here every day since I transferred in.」

Meguru-chan folds back the piano's cover and opens the lid over the keys.
She lightly presses a white key with her index finger.
Meguru
「It's such a pretty piano... It has such a comfortable and rich tone... It's very well cared for...」

％Ｂ
「Is it? This is just the extra classroom that's used when the first music classroom's full, so people don't come here that much.」

％Ｂ
「Is Rikka tuning this piano?」
Meguru
「I'm sure it's an actual piano tuner who tunes this piano. You can't tune a piano as easily as you would a string instrument.」

Meguru
「But I think Onee-chan's the one who does the daily maintenance. It's been done very thoroughly, and you can feel the love for the piano in every nook and cranny.」
Meguru-chan strokes the keys affectionately, props the lid of the piano up, and sits at the bench.

Meguru
「Pianos change tone very easily. You have to be very much on top of maintaining one, or else it'll become unplayable very quickly.」
％Ｂ
「I didn't know it was such a delicate instrument.」
I had no idea. I've only ever seen Rikka actually playing the piano, not maintaining it.

Meguru
「Really... So Onee-chan's still...」
She's not talking to herself...
It's like she's having a conversation with the piano... Like she's having a conversation with Rikka, through the piano.

And for that, one needs not words, but...
Meguru
「Suuuh... Hahhh...」
Meguru-chan takes a single set of deep breaths to calm herself, and then places her fingers on the keys.

Meguru
「...」
all
She assembles individual sounds into a single coherent stream.
It's "A Fragment of Emotion."
This piece is recorded on Meguru-chan's album. I know I've heard her performance of it before.

But it's completely different.
％Ｂ
「So this is a professional performance... Meguru-chan's performance...」
I shiver.
The impact of the moment pierces through me. It's like back when I heard Rikka's performance for the first time.

A dense, rumbling wall of sound that seems like it could reverberate all the way to my core.

It overtakes and dominates the room.
And yet the sound's delicate and light, as if it were flying through the open sky... But I can sense a burning-hot core within it.
Listening to it live, I can tell.
It sounds similar to Rikka's piano playing, but it's definitely different.
It isn't a matter of who's superior or inferior...
It's more like the differences between their respective paths―their differences as individuals.
Meguru
「There was a suggestion during our meeting that the two of us could play together. But Onee-chan said she wanted some time to think it over...」
％Ｂ
「Rikka's and Meguru-chan's sounds are...」
Meguru-chan's performance strikes a chord in my heart...
And I find myself imagining it overlaid onto Rikka's sound.
