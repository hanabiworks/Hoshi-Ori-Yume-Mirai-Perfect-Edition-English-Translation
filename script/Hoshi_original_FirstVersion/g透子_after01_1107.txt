We found out how Touko did on her first exam today.
Her results arrived in the mail as a single, modest card.
％Ｂ
「...That's a shame.」
The card clearly read "Failed."
We had more or less expected it.
We could pretty much guess how she had done when we checked over her answers.
You could say it was the obvious result.
She started studying from zero with only three months to work with... It might not have been enough time for her to even just appear to be qualified.

Touko
「Mmm... I tried pretty hard, too. Well, I guess there's no point in crying over spilled milk.」

％Ｂ
「Huh. You don't seem too down about it.」
Touko
「Ahaha, I could pretty much tell from when we checked my answers. I'll think about this as getting experience for next year. I know how it goes now, so now I'll just spend this next year preparing!」


％Ｂ
「...That's good to hear.」
Touko
「Mhm, I have to be positive. I'm going to pass next time for sure, and chase after you as fast as I can.



I don't have the time to be standing still.」

"Women are more determined than you think."
I recall Mr. Azuma's words from before.
％Ｂ
「Haha, it's just like Teacher said.」
Touko
「...What the heck? Did he put some weird ideas in your head again?」

％Ｂ
「Come on, what's the "again" for? He just told me that women are stronger than I'd imagine.」

Touko
「Ahahah! He always says such unique things. I guess he must have experience with that?」

Touko thought the exact same thing I did.
He never tells me anything about any failures of his relating to women, but there's probably no doubt that he's speaking from experience on that front.

Touko
「I'm sure he's amazing when it comes to his work, but I'm worried when it comes to that kinda stuff... I need to make sure he doesn't teach you anything weird.」

％Ｂ
「Don't worry. He knows that we've been together since forever.」

Touko
「You never know! He might be like, "You should always experience what you can!" and take you to a dirty shop.」

...No way.
There's probably a world that's unknown to me where there's a lot to learn... but it's not a world I should come to know...

％Ｂ
「I-I wouldn't go! I've got you, so I'd never go!」

Touko
「Ahaha, I'm kidding. I trust you, and besides, 
Ryousuke, 

you could never tell a lie like that.」




％Ｂ
「...Yeah.」
I don't know if I should really be proud of it, but I'm sure I'd give it away for sure.
I don't think I could even take that weighing on my conscience.
...Let's change the subject before my heart hurts any more than it already does.
％Ｂ
「You said you were gonna spend the year preparing. So you're gonna take it again next year?」

Touko
「Of course I am. I'm going to take it as many times as it takes for me to pass. Though I'll pass next year. I'll get left behind otherwise.」


％Ｂ
「Touko...」
Touko
「I won't tell you to wait for me. I want you to keep moving forward
, Ryousuke

. But I'll catch up to you for sure.」

She's thoroughly decided on her own path.
There's... no sign of the Touko who used to be so troubled about not being able to find a dream for herself.
