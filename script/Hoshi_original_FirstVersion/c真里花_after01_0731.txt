And so, it's finally the day of the architect exam―
Marika
「You haven't forgotten anything, have you? Have you made sure you have your exam admission ticket?」

She's asking me a bunch of questions while we wait for the bus.
％Ｂ
「Yeah, I'm good. Thanks for all this.」

She came over early in the morning to worry over me.
She's even come out to see me off on the bus to the exam hall.

Marika
「Because it's an important exam. But I'm glad you don't look like you're too nervous.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah. I've already done everything I can.」
I started studying bit by bit with this exam in mind ever since I started working at the Azuma Architectural Firm.

I'm nervous, of course, but I already know I've done what I can. If anything, I'm calm and composed.

Marika
「A-And... Have you made sure you have your good luck charm?」
％Ｂ
「Ahaha. Yeah, I do. Don't worry.」
Marika
「Oh, okay... Then you'll be fine.」
all
％Ｂ
「Oh, there's the bus.」
I can see it driving up.
It's right on time. Seems like a good omen.
％Ｂ
「Oh, actually... I did forget one thing.」
Marika
「What? What is it～?」
％Ｂ
「My other good luck charm from you.」
Marika
「Oh...」
Marika
「Right... Mhm, that's true.」
She smiles a little shyly.
And...
Marika
「...Chu.」
％Ｂ
「Mmh...」
I feel something soft on my lips for an instant.
Marika's lips.
She's looking down at the ground before me, bright red.
Marika
「Go...Good luck!」
％Ｂ
「Yeah... Thanks!」
all
That just happens to be when the bus doors open.
Marika
「You'll definitely do great, Ryousuke! I'm cheering for you!」

Marika
「You'll definitely do great! I'm cheering for you!」

％Ｂ
「Yeah... I'm going!」
all
Marika
「Y-You can do it... You can do it...!」
She waves her hand as hard as she can to see me off.
Seeing her do that blows away the last dregs of my nervousness.
I'm gonna pass! I swear!
