Touko
「Mmm... Is this right...? Am I supposed to write my maiden name for this?」

Time really waits for no man.
It's been about half a year since Touko and I got engaged.
We met with each other's parents and started looking for a venue for the ceremony.
Preparing for our wedding while keeping up our usual busy schedule was harder than we had ever imagined.

I have my eye on the first-class architect qualification exam.
I've already started studying for it. It's never too early.
Touko's done her best every day while supporting my efforts.
Now that things have calmed down a little, we've decided to finally submit our formal marriage registration.\n\r

And so we're currently filling out the paperwork for that.
％Ｂ
「Yeah, looks like it. You can just write Yukimura there. Whoa, I feel like I haven't said your last name in forever.」

Touko
「Ahaha, you're right. It reminds me of back when we first met.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah... I never would've imagined things would turn out this way. You never took me seriously at all back then.」

Touko
「I didn't think this would happen either. That I'd be getting married to that boy who was so persistent about getting me to join the event committee.」

We reminisce over fond memories while we fill out the marriage registration form.\n \n\r
Our memories of the time we spent in the old school building are precious to us, and they're still vivid in our minds even now.

Touko
「I wish I could show the two of us from back then this form. They'd never believe it. It'd be fun.」

In retrospect, there were lots of different possibilities for my future back then... but I've chosen to be with Touko.

A chance encounter became a lifelong connection, and now it's linked to my future.
I don't regret the path I've chosen, and I know for sure I don't want Touko to have any regrets either.

％Ｂ
「We might not be able to communicate with the past, but we can with the future. Like your mom and dad's time capsule.」

Touko
「Ahaha, that'd be kinda embarrassing. My dad was crazy embarrassed when I told him we found that.」


％Ｂ
「But don't you think it'd be nice to have something physical to remember things by? Like photos or a video or something. I wanna make something for us too.」

Touko
「Mmm... Let's seeee, then wanna record a video? Okay, a statement for us in the future, please!」

She points her phone at me.
Wait, we're doing this already!?
％Ｂ
「Wha!? Wait, you can't just start recording out of nowhere!」
Touko
「Ahahah! This'll be great to look back on in the future! Come on, you need to say something profound!」

％Ｂ
「I don't have anything ready! Cut! We're redoing this!」

Touko
「Nooope. Oh, let's play this back for everyone at the ceremony. They'd love it for sure.」

％Ｂ
「Seriously, don't! People are gonna make fun of me for the rest of my life!」
Touko
「Whaaat, but I like this venue's ceremony style! This dress is cuter!」

We're picking out a style for our wedding ceremony.
It's been a while since I've seen Touko get this demanding.
％Ｂ
「...Did you look at the price? This one's half as expensive.」

Touko
「Mmm～...! Oh, why don't we just make the wedding rings cheaper to make up for it!? Let's adjust the other things a little～! Pleeease～!」


％Ｂ
「Yeah, but... It's not like we can just skimp on food, so...」

$$chr_jumploop
Touko
「This one this one～! I wanna weaar～ thiiis～ dreeess～! It has to be this ooone～! It's the cutest ooone～!」

...Oh god.
That look on her face is telling me she's never gonna back down on this...
Which reminds me, back when we went to go check out the venues...
The planners at every single one we went to kept whispering, "The woman's opinion is everything for a marriage"...

％Ｂ
「...Sigh. Ugh... Yes, fine... They said we could make the invitations by hand to save money, so I guess I'll take the time to do that...」


And I'll get the flowers from somewhere cheap too.
Oh, that one client I got to know before was a florist, if I recall... I'll try asking them.

Touko
「Eheheeeh. Thanks, I love you! Okay then, what should I get for the reception dress...? The Japanese style one's nice, but a color dress is the way to go!」


％Ｂ
「...You have to pick from this list.」
Touko
「Whaaat～!? Those aren't that cuuute～! Oh, how about this one!? It says it's made from Japanese materials! It's cute and cool! I want this ooone～!」


％Ｂ
「...Touko. Are you listening to me...?」
...This one's crazy expensive too...!
We're already way over the budget we set for ourselves. The number on the calculator's almost double what we said we'd spend.

Touko
「But it's a once-in-a-lifetime ceremony, Ryousuke. I want you to have me when I'm pretty, and I think it'd be more exciting for everyone too.」


Touko
「But it's a once-in-a-lifetime ceremony. I want you to have me when I'm pretty, and I think it'd be more exciting for everyone too.」


％Ｂ
「...That's not fair.」
Guess we'll strike the candle-lighting thing from the list too...
I'll have to figure out some way to make my own attire cheaper to make up for the rest.
Touko
「Ehehe. Sorry for being selfish.」
She apologizes playfully.
The fact that I let stuff like this slide must be why people always say she's got me in the palm of her hand...

Touko
「That's the first one, then. The second one can be...」
％Ｂ
「Excuse me!? You're getting two!? No! Absolutely not! I'm never letting you do that!」

Touko
「Whaaat, you cheapskate! There's so many other dresses I'm interested in! I can't wear ones like these except for a ceremony!」


％Ｂ
「Just wear it for a photo! That's the most I'm gonna compromise with you!」

Touko
「Whaaat～!? There's no point if I don't show everyone～! I'm never backing down on this either～!」

...I guess we'll be locked in combat again tonight.
Are we really gonna be able to settle on things before the ceremony...?
％Ｂ
「Touko. Segawa said she'd organize the after-party. She was like, "Allow the organization master to handle this!"」

I haven't seen Segawa and the others in a while.
I've been so busy since starting my job that I haven't had the opportunity to see them.

Touko
「Ahaha, she's the same as ever. I haven't seen Natsuki in forever.」
She smiles happily.
We're nothing but grateful toward Segawa for agreeing to do this. Especially since she must be busy with her own life.

％Ｂ
「You haven't seen the others since you started working either, right?」
Touko
「No? I've been talking with Marika about the wedding and stuff.」

％Ｂ
「Excuse me!? When!?」
Touko
「Though I haven't seen Misa and Rikka in ages because they're apparently busy. Oh, I saw Sora the other day too.」

...You couldn't have invited me along?
I was doing so much to connect you guys back in high school... I'm feeling kinda lonely now.

Touko
「What about you
, Ryousuke

? You're going to invite Four-Eyes-kun, right?」

％Ｂ
「I'll send out an invitation... but I haven't seen him in a while 'cause we've both been busy.」
Touko
「You need to cherish your friendships, you know. They're all important people who helped us come together.」

％Ｂ
「Hm? What's that?」
She pulls out a small box.
She's holding it really preciously... What's inside?
Touko
「It's my treasure. I've decided to use these for our ceremony.」
all
％Ｂ
「Oh, these are...」
The box is filled with a small stack of paper.
It's the tanzaku with everyone's wishes to Touko that I ran all over the school to get, and a bamboo decoration.

Touko
「I want to make a bamboo decoration to put next to the welcome board. It won't be the right season, but it's perfect for us... It'd be a bit of a wonderful extra thing, won't it?」

％Ｂ
「Now these take me back... Still, though... I'm surprised you kept these. I thought they burned these along with the bamboo.」

Touko
「Four-Eyes-kun gave them to me in secret. He said, "Take good care of your memories."」

...When'd he do that?
Dammit, Shuuichi... You're pretty cool.
The hell's the point of my heart twinging for Shuuichi?
Touko
「I'm sure it'll make everyone feel all nostalgic. I wanna give something back to everyone who's taken care of us until now... and I want them to keep watching us now.」


％Ｂ
「...Yeah. Let's make all the proper preparations so we don't embarrass ourselves.」
Touko
「Ehehe... Our rings are pretty.」
The two of us went to pick up our wedding rings together.
I was thinking about something Ousaka said when we were ordering them, so I left the design up to Touko if she promised to let me handle the stone settings.

Ousaka told us about the two stars known as the Married Stars.
She said I was Arcturus, and Touko was Spica.
I took inspiration from that conversation and had gemstones set into the insides of our rings.

A sapphire to symbolize the blue-white light of Spica for mine.
A fire opal to symbolize the orange light of Arcturus for Touko's.

Touko
「I'm amazed you remembered the stars Sora told us about. That was back when she showed them to us up on the roof, right?」

％Ｂ
「Actually, I secretly checked with Ousaka before we put in the order. I remembered Spica right away, but I had to ask about Arcturus.」


Touko
「Yeah. They were so pretty. That was the first time I ever looked through a telescope... but I can still remember how those stars glittered back then.」


all
She closes her eyes in nostalgia.
We've been thinking about the past a lot as we've been moving through preparing for our wedding.
％Ｂ
「Remember what Ousaka said? About how Arcturus and Spica are slowly getting closer.」

Touko
「Yeah, I think she said... they'd be closest in fifty thousand years? Ahaha, we'll have to live for a long time to see that.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah. But we're together now. We beat the stars.」

We just "liked" each other back then.
We spent many long years together, spinning out a single thread along the way.
And I'm sure... that thread is our future. It shines brighter than any star in the sky.
Touko
「Ahaha, what the heck? What's the point in competing with the stars?」
％Ｂ
「Figured we might as well compete with the heavy hitters. Don't you think Ousaka'd get excited about this conversation?」

Touko
「Mmm... I feel like she'd have a comeback. Like, "You two are still nothing compared to the stars."」

Our good old friends.
I'm sure they'll come to our wedding... and celebrate our union with the same smiles as back then.

Touko
「Oh, right. Did you make the invitations?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. All that's left is to check over the addresses and send them out.」
Touko
「Is it okay if I write in messages for everyone? I'd get embarrassed saying them directly, so I wanted to at least write out my gratitude.」


％Ｂ
「Oh, I like that idea. I might write something too.」
Touko
「Whaaat? Then you write first! It'd be embarrassing if you saw what I wrote.」

％Ｂ
「It's embarrassing for me too, you know. You're the one who came up with the idea, so you go first.」

Touko
「I don't wannaaa! I can't believe you want to peek at secrets between girls... You perv!」

％Ｂ
「Hmph, say whatever you want. You're not gonna fool me.」

Touko
「...You used to get freaked out over things like this before. It was cute.」
It appears I have lost my cuteness.
Not that I ever really thought I had any in the first place.
％Ｂ
「We need to ask Mr. Azuma to give a speech too. Hope he doesn't say anything weird.」

Touko
「Mmm... Who knows? I feel like he'd say, "That's not my thing," and run away.」

％Ｂ
「We'll force him. He won't have a choice if we plan it out in advance, right? Let's make him squirm a bit.」

Touko
「Ahaha, you sure have gotten strong. You never used to say things like that. I feel sorry for Mr. Azuma.」


％Ｂ
「...Touko. You're not convincing anyone if you smile like that while you say it.」

It's only a little longer until our ceremony.
Now that we've more or less finished with preparations, we're taking our time planning out our honeymoon.

Touko
「Mmm... Hawaii's a classic, but Europe sounds nice too...! Hey, let's do like three honeymoons!」


％Ｂ
「How are we gonna get time off for all that...? It took a ton of effort for us to both get a week off, remember...?」


Touko
「Mmhhh... We're getting married thooough... Couldn't they let us be at least a little selfish?」

And even if we did manage to get the time off for that, I'd probably keel over once I saw all the work we'd have to do to make up for it once we got back.

I've really become a genuine working adult, haven't I...
Touko
「If we're going to go to lots of different places, then it should be somewhere continental, not an island... Oh, a world heritage site tour sounds great too! A week just isn't enooough...」


％Ｂ
「...So I guess it's a trip around the world now.」
Touko
「We have to make lots of memories. And... making a baby on our honeymoon sounds nice too.」

Touko's really started to want a kid now that the wedding's coming up.
We've started having more definite discussions about our future recently.
％Ｂ
「Oh yeah, I've been working on this bit by bit whenever I had some time to spare. Take a look.」

Touko
「Mm? What's this?」
I hand her the blueprint I finished earlier today.
I'm sure this is still in the far future... but this is my way of giving our happiness physical form. By drawing out a new place for us to belong.

％Ｂ
「I was thinking our house could be something like this. I wanna hear your opinion too, so let's take our time and start thinking about it together.」

Touko
「Wow...! Wow, wow! When'd you make this!?」
Her eyes shine as she looks at the blueprint.
I want to create a place where we're always smiling.
The feelings I had in my heart when I looked at Mr. Azuma's Marinpia Shionagi were the inspiration for me to want to be an architect.

I packed those same feelings into this blueprint.\n \n\r

So Touko and I, and the child we'll have someday in the future... So that we could always be smiling.
Touko
「So I see two children's rooms... Does that mean you want two kids?」

％Ｂ
「Uhh... Yeah. 'Cause we both didn't have any siblings, you know? I thought it'd be more fun if we had more than one kid around.」

Touko
「Mhm, that's true... Do you want a boy or girl?」

％Ｂ
「Let's see... I think I want a girl. I bet she'd be pretty just like you.」

Touko
「I think... I think I want a boy. A healthy boy who's just like you
, Ryousuke

.」
Touko
「Ahaha, I guess we'll have to have two kids for sure. Oh, a boy-girl set of twins might be nice.」

％Ｂ
「I dunno if we could handle two at once... We've never raised kids before or anything...」

Touko
「Don't worry. Your mom and dad said they'd help. They're looking forward to our baby so much.」

％Ｂ
「Excuse me!? When did you even talk to them about that!?」
Touko
「A little while ago. We talked about it when I went to have your mom teach me her cooking.」


％Ｂ
「Ugh... You guys always get along so well.」
Touko
「Your mom and dad said they wanted it to be a girl. They were having lots of fun picking out the crib and toys.」

％Ｂ
「...They sure are moving fast.」
They're way too excited...
If you're gonna do that, then do it after we announce we've got a baby on the way...
Touko
「Let's make a warm home together. The happiest home in the world.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. We'll have to do our best at work for that.」
Touko
「Ahaha, that's true. We're compleeetely out of savings after the wedding and the honeymoon.」

％Ｂ
「...Let's stop talking about this. You're dragging me back to reality.」
Touko
「Daddy's going to work reeeal hard, okaaay? You wanna live in a nice, big house, don't yooou?」

％Ｂ
「There's no one in there yet! It's too early to rub your belly and talk to it like that!」

Touko
「You never knooow. We might've made a baby when we did it last night. And I want you to do your best tonight too.」


We're shaping our future, bit by bit.
There's a happiness that only we can make, that only we can have... I have to make that into reality. Together with Touko.

Today's my birthday. It's also the day of our wedding.
We decided to hold the ceremony on the same date as the proposal.
Touko's wearing a pure white dress.
Lots of different thoughts and expressions fill my mind, but there's only one thing that ends up coming out.
％Ｂ
「...You're beautiful.」
Touko
「Mhm, thanks. You look cool too
, Ryousuke

.」
I was nervous, but seeing Touko's calmed me down a bit.
She makes my heart race more than anyone else, but she also comforts me just as much.
And today... I'll pledge my everlasting love to her.
Touko
「The day's finally here

, Ryousuke

... I'll be your bride, starting today.」
The path here was a long one... but when I think back, it seems like it all passed in an instant.\n \n\r
All of the various emotions I've felt along the way well up within me, one after another, now that Touko's wearing this dress in front of me.

％Ｂ
「We've been able to get here thanks to the support of lots of people. Let's announce ourselves to all of them today.」

Touko
「Mhm. I hope we can repay them at least a little this way.」
Today's our wedding... but we're also considering it an opportunity for us to repay our favors.

All our friends who connected us back on that day of the Tanabata Festival.
Mr. Azuma, and our fellow coworkers at the firm. The people who've supported us through our work.
And of course, my parents and Touko's parents.
There are others too... I want to extend our gratitude to all of the people who've watched over and helped us.

％Ｂ
「If we hold our heads high and tell them, "We are happy," I'm sure they'll smile for us.」

Touko
「...Yeah. I might cry a bit, though.」
Lots of memories come to mind.
But it's still too soon to get emotional and teary.
％Ｂ
「Come on, you can't cry yet. You're gonna ruin your makeup if you cry now.」

Touko
「Hgh... Mhm, I'm okay. Ehehe, sorry about that. Let's talk about something else, then.」

Touko
「Mmm... I know. Is there still more to your dream from now on
, Ryousuke

?」
％Ｂ
「Huh? More to my dream... I'll get my first-class qualification, and become independent someday...」

Touko
「I wanna hear about what comes after that. Anything's fine, so tell me.」

Hmm... I'd only be able to say something really vague.
Because I need to overcome lots of obstacles in order to make my dream a reality.

％Ｂ
「Let's see... I still wanna make a place that makes people smile. I'll find out in what ways I can make that idea into reality... So I guess that's how my dream's gonna keep going.」


I can't say anything specific just yet.
But I'll get my qualifications, and build up lots and lots of experience... And one day, I want to be involved in something big, to make lots of people smile.

％Ｂ
「I don't know how much power I have, but I wanna find out. I'm sure there's gonna be lots of hard and painful times... but as long as the possibility exists, I wanna go for it.」


Touko
「You'll have to pass your exams first. You're studying lots even though you're so busy. I'm sure you'll be fine.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah. I can't be uncool in front of you, after all. I dunno what I'd do if you fell out of love with me.」

Touko
「Ahaha, yeah. I want you to always show me your cool side.」

％Ｂ
「It's the same for me, you know. I want you to always be cute for me.」

Touko
「Mmm... Being cute isn't the only good part of a woman, you know. I'll do my best to make sure you fall in love with me more
, Ryousuke

.」
...Is it okay for me to love her more than I do now?
I'll need to put in as much effort as possible, to make sure I can be the kind of man Touko will fall more in love with too.

Touko
「My turn now. Can I tell you... about my dream?」

％Ｂ
「...Yeah. Please tell me.」
Touko
「My dream's to support you
, Ryousuke

. The happy things, the sad things, the fun things, the painful things... I want to split aaall of it evenly between the two of us, and support your dreams that way.」





Touko
「My dream is to always walk beside you... and treasure and protect your dream.


」

％Ｂ
「Touko...」
Touko
「I'm sure... that it's something only I can do. It's my dream and mine alone. These feelings haven't changed... and won't change in the future either.」

She smiles quietly at me.
It's the happiest smile I've ever seen from her.
Touko
「Let's... make your dream come true someday. You made my wish come true. I'm sure you'll be able to make your dream come true too


, Ryousuke

.」
I want to protect this smile for the rest of my life.
I vow to treasure this smile, no matter what happens.
Touko
「I know! Let's go make a wish at Shionagi Academy's Tanabata Festival next year. I'm sure it'll come true if we make a wish on a star there.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah. Let's do that. And the effect will double if we write it together on a tanzaku.」

We'll go back once more to where everything began for us.
Let's hold hands there, and wish on a star together.
We'll entrust the future with our dreams... to deliver them to us in the future.
Female Venue Staff
「Are you ready? Please come out to the ceremony area if you are.」

％Ｂ
「We understand. Thank you very much.」
Now then. It's time to turn the page to a new chapter in my life.
I'm sure the path ahead of me won't be easy. I'll bump into walls over and over, and I might lose sight of the path I should tread at times, and end up lost.


...But I'm not worried.
I'm not alone. Touko will always be by my side.
No matter what happens from now on... Touko and I will support each other and overcome it all.
％Ｂ
「All right... Let's go, Touko. They're waiting for us.」
Touko
「...Yes, dear.」
