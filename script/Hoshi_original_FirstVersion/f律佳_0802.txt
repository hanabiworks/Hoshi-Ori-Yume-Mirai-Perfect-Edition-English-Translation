「This one's the last one. Stand back, everyone. Just in case.」
From my position up on the stepladder, I motion everyone to step away in case it falls.
％Ｂ
「Hup...」
I let go of the small light bulb I've attached to the black ceiling cover after checking to make sure they've all evacuated the immediate area.

The entire ceiling's covered in black.
All that's left is to plug this cord in.
Sora
「...Done.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. It's done.」

Marika
「Congratulations!」
all
Touko
「Maaan, that took a whiiile.」

Misa
「How wonderful! This is our display!」

all
Natsuki
「It really looks great! This is the best～!」
all
We all look around the classroom.
This room was completely empty two months ago, but now it's stuffed with our memories together.

The fish we collected from the ocean swim energetically in the fish tanks. It's like a small aquarium.

And once we turn them on, the panels on the ceilings will illuminate with Shionagi's night sky.

％Ｂ
「We can't rest easy yet. There's still a lot of stuff to do before the day of.」

％Ｂ
「I wish we could move right into trying out our first illumination, but...」
Marika
「We'd want Narusawa-san to be here too, right?」

Misa
「Yes. Rikka-san is another important member of our group.」
all
Sora
「Is Ritsu busy?」
Touko
「Piano-chan's right there.」
all

Yukimura points down at the grounds through a gap in the window curtains.

There are people carrying in supplies for building the outdoor concert venue.

It looks like Rikka and Ishizuka-san are talking with the contractors.
_00cutinBS
％Ｂ
「She's apparently gonna practice with Meguru-chan after the two of them are done with their work, so she probably won't have time.」

Misa
「Let's do it tomorrow, then!」

Sora
「...*nod* I want Ritsu to see the first illumination too.」
％Ｂ
「Thanks. I'll make sure to tell her.」
all
Touko
「So there's nothing left to do today, then?」
％Ｂ
「I guess so.」
Touko
「I'll be going, then. Great work todaaay.」
Natsuki
「I'll go do some grad-alb committee work too. Lateeer!」
all
Marika
「You're going to wait for Narusawa-san, right?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, that's the plan.」
Marika
「I'll go home too, then. See you tomorrow.」
％Ｂ
「Okay. I'll be counting on you again tomorrow.」
all
Misa
「What will you do, Sora-san?」

Sora
「Look at the stars on the rooftop.」
Misa
「That sounds wonderful! Would it be okay if I joined you?」
Sora
「...No issues. Summer nights are long.」
％Ｂ
「Make sure you go home when you're supposed to, all right?」
Though I guess I shouldn't have to worry about that if Okihara-senpai's with her.
％Ｂ
「I'll come with you.」
all
Sora
「You want to look at the stars too, Ryou?」
Sora
「You want to look at the stars too?」
％Ｂ
「I'll bring the telescope up for you. It's heavy, right?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
all
I go to the music classroom after carrying the telescope up to the rooftop.
Neither Rikka nor Meguru-chan is here yet.
The room's silent, as if it were completely removed from the hustle and bustle of the Tanabata Festival preparations outside.

％Ｂ
「Now that I think about it, it's been a while since I've seen this room empty.」
Not since that time Rikka lost her sheet music, I think.
The precious sheet music that there are only two copies of in this world.
Rikka was so desperate to find it.
Rikka's past must have been something she wanted to forget, but at the same time it must also have been something irreplaceably precious to her.

She just couldn't face it head-on.
Meguru
「Oh, Senpaiii. Hello.」
％Ｂ
「Hi there.」
Meguru
「Are you done with committee work already?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. That's why I came to check on how it was going, but...」
Meguru
「It doesn't seem like Onee-chan's done yet.」
％Ｂ
「Looks like it. How about you take a bit of a break? Aren't you tired from work?」
Meguru
「This much is fine. Piano playing's all about stamina. I'm quite fit, you know. Ehhem!」

She flexes cutely to try to show off her muscles.
Hmm～ ...I don't really see that much of a difference...
Though I dunno if I'd really like it if she were really muscular either...
Meguru
「More importantly, Senpai... May I lodge a bit of a complaint with you?」
％Ｂ
「A complaint?」
Meguru
「Onee-chan and I took a bath together last night and slept in the same bed. She looked very comfortable while she was sleeping. It made me want to stay up and watch her all night long.」
Meguru
「She must have been tired from all the long days of work lately. I found myself petting her on the head without even thinking.」

％Ｂ
「That sounds heartwarming.」
Meguru
「Yes, until that point... And then Onee-chan said something in her sleep.」

Meguru
「She said, "Ehehe... That felt so good, Ryousuke..."」
Meguru
「She said, "Ehehe... That felt so good, ％Ｂ..."」
％Ｂ
「...」
My blood goes cold.
Meguru
「I have no intention of dictating what the two of you can and cannot do. Because you two are boyfriend and girlfriend. But!」
Meguru
「But I can't believe she'd be thinking of another man while I was there sleeping by her side at that very moment!!」
％Ｂ
「That is not something a younger sister would say.」
％Ｂ
「Weren't you just saying yesterday that you were glad she had a boyfriend?」
Meguru
「These are two different things! Kiiiih! I met her before you, you know!!」

Meguru
「I love Onee-chan more, you know!!」
％Ｂ
「Hohoh. I can't just let that slide, can I?」
Meguru
「Do you think you're the one who knows Onee-chan better, then?」
I give an exaggerated nod.
Meguru
「Would you like to test the power of a younger sister's\n ＬＯＶＥ?」
I nod once more.
Meguru
「Then let us compete to see who knows Onee-chan better.」
And so begins the tournament to crown the true Rikka King (two participants total).

all
Meguru
「Onee-chan may seem tough, but she tears up more easily than you'd think.」
％Ｂ
「I know that too. She cries a lot. Especially when she's happy.」
Meguru
「Ughhh... So you knew that too. And wait a second, if you know that, then does that mean you've made Onee-chan cry before?」


％Ｂ
「A few times, yeah.」
Meguru
「More than once!? That certainly aligns with just how lovey-dovey she is toward you...」

％Ｂ
「My turn, then. Did you know that Rikka's recently gotten into reading manga?」

Meguru
「What!? Has she really!?」
％Ｂ
「I guess you didn't know.」
Meguru
「Uuh...!」
％Ｂ
「She got interested in them after she came over once, and I recommend and lend them to her every now and then.」

Meguru
「Now that you mention it, I feel like I remember seeing a manga for boys in her room... So that was yours...」

Meguru
「Gasp! Onee-chan's being influenced by you...!」
Meguru-chan places both hands on a desk in utter shock.
％Ｂ
「Looks like I'm going to be crowned the Rikka King.」
Meguru
「N-Not yet... It isn't over yet...! ...I didn't want to have to resort to saying this, but I have no choice.」

Meguru
「Senpai... Please don't underestimate the history I share with Onee-chan.」
Meguru
「When Onee-chan was in kindergarten, she watched a horror movie that had a person in a white mask dressed like the grim reaper, and she wet her bed because she was too afraid to go to the bathroom!」
％Ｂ
「Wh-Whaaaaat!?」
Rikka, of all people, wetting her bed!?
I know I was also terrified by the massacre scene from that exact same movie back when I was in preschool.
It was a pretty hilarious scene in retrospect, though.
Meguru
「It seems even you didn't know about this, Senpai.」
％Ｂ
「Kh... I didn't...」
Meguru
「Onee-chan was so cute the next morning. She was washing her sheets by herself with tears in her eyes so no one would notice.」

％Ｂ
「I wanna see it! I wanna see it so bad!」
Meguru
「It's captured perfectly in my mind. It's such a shame I can't show you the sight, Senpai.」

％Ｂ
「Khh... I should've known there's stuff I wouldn't know from when she was a kid. But I'll still take the title of Rikka King!」

Meguru
「No, I will! There are still lots of stories about her that you don't know!」

Rikka
「Hmmmh... And?」
％Ｂ
「Hgh...!」
Meguru
「Eek...!」
A bolt of fear runs through me.
all
Rikka
「...What's this "Rikka King" I'm hearing?」
％Ｂ
「R-Rikka...」

Meguru
「O-Onee-chan...」
％Ｂ
「...When'd you start listening?」
Rikka
「My, I wonder. Why don't you try guessing? You're the Rikka King, aren't you?」
Meguru
「Th-The part about wetting your bed?」
Rikka
「I do remember you talking about that, yes.」
％Ｂ
「Then from when we were talking about how you're more of a crybaby than you'd expect?」
Rikka
「I-I'm not a cryba... Mmm, I heard that too. How about before that?」
％Ｂ
「Uhh, what were we talking about before that again?」
Meguru
「You were bragging about how she just loves to be spoiled by you when it's just the two of you alone together.」

％Ｂ
「Right, that's it.」
Rikka
「I see... So you were talking about that too.」
That's when I realize she's just been making us confess things on our own.
all
％Ｂ
「...Meguru-chan. We've been had.」
Meguru
「It seems we fell hook, line, and sinker for Onee-chan's masterful conversational cunning...」

Meguru-chan and I look at each other and nod.
％Ｂ
「I guess we shouldn't have been trying to crown a Rikka King in the first place at all.」
Meguru
「You're right. Our memories of Onee-chan are all irreplaceably wonderful, and can't be compared to one another.」


Meguru
「Let us peaceably shake hands, Senpai. Fufufu...」
％Ｂ
「You're right. Hahaha...」
A cease-fire, made in cold sweat...
Rikka
「Is that the end of the show?」
all
％Ｂ
「Yes. The end. Yes.」
Rikka
「I'm glad that my boyfriend and younger sister are getting along well. But I think you two may have gotten a little too excited.」

％Ｂ
「I'm very sorry.」

Meguru
「I'm sorry.」
all
Rikka
「Sigh... No embarrassing stories when I'm not around. I'll forgive you two, since it seems like you regret your actions. Now let's get practicing.」

％Ｂ
「You sure?」
Rikka
「Do you want me to lecture or punish you?」
％Ｂ
「I'd prefer not, obviously, but still.」
Rikka
「It's partly my fault for making you wait because I was busy with committee work. And like I said earlier, it makes me happy to see you and Meguru getting along.」


Rikka
「Seeing everyone get along makes things more fun for me too. Hehe.」
Our lives are fun even when all we're doing is just stupid stuff.
And more than anything, getting to see Rikka smile like this every day makes me happy.
