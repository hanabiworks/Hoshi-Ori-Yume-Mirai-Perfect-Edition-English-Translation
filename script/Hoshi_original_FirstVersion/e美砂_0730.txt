I'm at Azuma-san's architectural firm to show him the photos of my nearly complete model of Marinpia Shionagi.

I would've liked to have brought the actual thing, but the model ended up way too big for me to carry here on my own.


％Ｂ
「What do you think?」
Azuma
「Hm... Well, it doesn't look like there are any particular issues.」
％Ｂ
「Really!?」
Azuma
「But that's only from what I can see in these photos. I can't say anything more until I see it in person.」

％Ｂ
「Y-Yes, of course...」
Azuma
「Though I have to say... I didn't think you'd do this much. Especially in such a short span of time.」

％Ｂ
「I really tried my best! I put in everything I had to make a model of your greatest work!」


Azuma
「And so that means you didn't do that for your interview?」
％Ｂ
「Oh, no... I didn't mean it like...」
Azuma
「Haha, I'm kidding. Still, I'm impressed at how it turned out. I'm looking forward to seeing the actual thing.」


Azuma
「You said you're doing your display on the 6th?」
％Ｂ
「Wha... Are you going to come see, Teacher!?」
Azuma
「Of course I am. It may be old, but it's still my work. If I show up and it's mediocre, I'm gonna smash it to bits on the spot. You better be ready.」


％Ｂ
「Y-Yes! I'll do my best!」
％Ｂ
「Aaall... riiiiiiiight!」
I yell and pump my fist without thinking as I leave.
It may have just been the photo, but Azuma-san still praised my model...\n\r

He's approved of me!
Though of course, that won't be for real until he sees it in person... but I'm still really happy right now.

％Ｂ
「And on top of that, he's gonna actually come on the day of.」
I'm really starting to get pumped.
％Ｂ
「All right, let's go home right away and put the finishing touches on―」
％Ｂ
「Hm?」
It's a LIME message.
Who sent it?
％Ｂ
「...Ousaka?」
It's not like her to be the one to initiate a LIME conversation.
【Sora】「Come to school right now.」
【％Ｂ】「What's wrong? Did #Nsomething happen?」
【Sora】「Trouble.」
【％Ｂ】「Trouble? What kinda #Ntrouble?」
【Sora】「Just come to school.」
％Ｂ
「What the heck? ...What kinda trouble?」
I've got a bad feeling about this.
Anyway, I gotta get to school!
I walk into the old school building's classroom.
Ousaka and Misa-senpai are standing in front of one of the tanks.
％Ｂ
「What's wrong? Ousaka told me something...」
all
My eyes go wide when I see the tanks.
％Ｂ
「What the... What's...? Why are the tanks so dirty!?」
There's something green sludged up against the glass.\n \n \n\r
％Ｂ
「Misa-senpai! What's all this stuff...!?」
Misa
「Ryousuke-san...」
Misa
「Hauh...」
She turns to me, her lips shut tight in a thin line.

Misa
「Sora-san noticed this and contacted me.」

Sora
「...I came to school to do maintenance on the telescope. I came here because I wanted to watch the fish too, and found them like this.」


％Ｂ
「And then you contacted us... Thanks, Ousaka.」
Sora
「...I told Mari and the others too. I think everyone's coming.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah... You've been a big help.」
all
We'll have to talk over what to do once we're all here.
How could this have happened? There's only a week until the Tanabata Festival...

Shinozaki and the others eventually show up too.
Marika
「Wawah!? What is this!?」
Natsuki
「They're completely green...」
all
Touko
「Are the fish inside okay?」
Misa
「Yes, for now.」
Rikka
「Do you know what caused this?」
Misa
「...I believe it may be an unnatural proliferation of algae due to an excess of nutrition.」
％Ｂ
「An unnatural proliferation of algae?」
Rikka
「An excess of nutrition... Wait, does that mean we gave the fish too much food?」
Touko
「Is... Is it my fault? Because I gave the fish tons of food?」
Misa
「No, that isn't necessarily the case. There are multiple possible causes. It may be that we prioritized our display too much and placed too many fish in the tanks.」


Misa
「The more fish there are, the more they excrete. If the filtration system cannot keep up, it will result in more food for the algae, and possibly lead to this.」


Misa
「Another possible reason is the recent increase in temperatures.」
Rikka
「It has been getting hotter and hotter since the hurricane.」
％Ｂ
「I hear red tides happen more often in the summer, so it might be similar to that...」

Misa
「Regardless, the conditions for this to happen already existed. This is clearly due to my own negligence, for not thinking to prevent this despite knowing all this...」


％Ｂ
「Negligence? But...」
all
Marika
「If someone as knowledgeable as you couldn't prevent this... then I don't think anyone could have.」

％Ｂ
「Sh-She's right. It isn't your fault, Misa-senpai.」
all
Misa
「No, this is my responsibility. This would not have happened if I had controlled things more properly.」


Sora
「...Nature can't be controlled.」
Misa
「Ousaka-san...」
Sora
「...If you're dealing with nature, then unexpected trouble is a given. There's no point in regretting it. We should be thinking of how to fix this instead of who's responsible.」


all
Natsuki
「Sora's right. We can feel bad about ourselves later. For now, we need to do something about this dirty water. Tell us what we need to do.」


all
％Ｂ
「Senpai?」
Misa
「...Yes... I understand.」
She recomposes herself and gives a small nod.
Misa
「There are several solutions. The first would be to physically remove as much of the algae from the water as possible.」

Misa
「We could also increase the number of tanks, and lower the number of fish per tank so as to maintain a healthy balance.」

Misa
「In addition, we could collect small shrimp that would feed on the algae and place them inside the tanks to eat the algae.」

Touko
「Which should we do?」
Misa
「All of them. I'm sure that doing all of the above options would resolve our current situation.」

％Ｂ
「I understand. Now that we know what to do, let's get working right away!」

all
Rikka
「We should probably split up the work.」
％Ｂ
「Okay, I'll get more tanks ready. Narusawa, Yukimura, you two prepare the artificial seawater.」

Rikka
「Got it.」
Touko
「Okay, roger that!」
all
％Ｂ
「Shinozaki, Segawa, you two clean the algae out of the tanks.」
Marika
「Okay!」
Natsuki
「We've got this!」
all
％Ｂ
「Ousaka, you and Misa-senpai go out and collect those shrimp.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
all
％Ｂ
「I'll let you handle it, Misa-senpai.」
all
Misa
「...」
She's staring blankly at the cloudy green tanks.
％Ｂ
「Senpai?」
Sora
「...Misa... We need to prioritize getting the water clean first.」
Misa
「...I apologize.」
I know exactly how she feels.
I know how much she must want to beat herself up.
But there's something we need to do first.
all
％Ｂ
「Okay, then I'm counting on you guys!」
We're just gonna do what we can, with everything we've got!
We have to!
