『―The rain and wind will continue to grow stronger until evening, peaking at 6 p.m. It will most likely be a mid-latitude cyclone that will pass completely by late tonight toward the Sea of Japan.』

『The hurricane will be accompanied by a rough storm surge, so please take care to not approach the shoreline.』

『Next is sports. Four games of professional baseball were played yesterday. Crystal Stadium Shionagi was―』

It's been raining sideways since noon.
％Ｂ
「Nnngh... I don't feel like doing anything.」
I slump over to lie on the couch while dimly watching TV.
I should really be using this extra time to study my architecture stuff...
But I can't focus. My mind's in disarray like a hurricane in and of itself.

I suggested to everyone over LIME earlier that we should cancel our Tanabata Festival prep for today.

It's dangerous enough that we're getting severe storm warnings.
It'll only be for a day, since the hurricane's apparently going to be gone by tonight.

We planned out our timeline for the preparations to end comfortably before the day of the festival, so a day off doesn't mean much.
The thing that's currently weighing on my mind is...
％Ｂ
「Were there any ships that didn't sink after being lured by Lorelei... she said.」
Meguru-chan is Lorelei, and Rikka's a ship...
％Ｂ
「Meguru-chan lures Rikka to her, and Rikka sinks...」
Is Meguru-chan's lure her piano playing...?
Does Rikka think of her piano playing as a lure?
What is it that's making her think that?
It's obvious that Rikka's got something like an inferiority complex to Meguru-chan in regard to piano playing.
But I can't help but feel there's something more...
％Ｂ
「Agh, dammit! It's too loud!」
The sound of the wind and rain hammering on the windows disperses any thoughts I was trying to organize.

I push one ear against the couch and hold my hand over the other one.
I can compose myself a little after closing my eyes too.
Rikka was about to tell me...
I'm sure she'll tell me when I see her next.
...Is that gonna be tomorrow?
I wonder if she'll still want to tell me by then.
It'll have been an entire day since then.
There's no guarantee that she won't change her mind.
I'm incredibly bitter about today's hurricane.
％Ｂ
「Were there any ships that didn't sink... after being lured by Lorelei...」
I'm starting to lose track of things again.
Even my consciousness is starting to dim.
％Ｂ
「Lorelei... Lorelei...」
Lore...lei...
Lo...re...
...
％Ｂ
「...Nh... Mh?」
I wake up to the sound of my phone ringing.
％Ｂ
「Wha... I... I guess I must've fallen asleep.」
I reach out toward the light of my phone's display in the dark room.
_smh_st_02
_smh_st_btn02
_smh_st_02
_smh_st_btn05
％Ｂ
「Yes... Hello?」
Rikka
『You sound really sleepy... Did I wake you up?』
％Ｂ
「Rikka!?」
Rikka
『Kyah!? What are you shouting for...?』
％Ｂ
「S-Sorry.」
Rikka
『It's not strange to get a phone call from me, is it?』
％Ｂ
「No, it isn't, but...」
It's because I was thinking about her before I fell asleep.
I thought she might've called because she wanted to continue where she left off yesterday.
％Ｂ
「So why'd you call?」
Rikka
『...Do I have to have a reason to call?』
Her voice sounds sad.
％Ｂ
「No, I'm totally happy with you calling any time.」
Rikka
『...Thank you. You really are kind... I just suddenly wanted to hear your voice. I wonder why...』

％Ｂ
「...」
Rikka
『Maybe not seeing you for a day's messed up my internal rhythm. After seeing you every day for a while.』

Rikka's not lying.
But I feel like it's not everything either.
％Ｂ
「Then can I come see you right now? I wanna see you too.」
Rikka
『...Right now? ...There's a hurricane outside. There's even a severe storm warning. It's dangerous. You can't come in this weather. Don't. Let's see each other tomorrow, okay?』

％Ｂ
「Will you tell me if we talk tomorrow?」
Rikka
『Wha...?』
％Ｂ
「No. It's nothing.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. You're right. It's way too dangerous to go out in this rain. I probably shouldn't.」

Rikka
『That's right. I wouldn't want anything to happen to you. Getting to hear your voice is enough.』

Her voice is bright and cheery.
Hearing it just makes me even more worried.
Meguru-chan said last night that she was in Tokyo.
She never said when she'd be back, but there's a good chance that planes and bullet trains wouldn't be running in the hurricane.

Rikka's alone in that too big a house.
What is she thinking while this terrible wind and rain rage outside? What is she feeling?

Rikka
『What do you want for lunch tomorrow? I can make something that takes a little more effort, since I have the time.』

She's trying to devote herself to me even when she's got something on her mind.
That's just the kind of girl Rikka is.
She's earnest, wholehearted, and thoughtful.
...And puts others before herself.
She can't rely on others, and worries endlessly about things on her own.
She's perceptive of her surroundings, but she never pays attention to herself.
She doesn't even try to.
％Ｂ
「Anything's fine if you're making it.」
Rikka
『I told you before, didn't I? That's the most difficult answer you could give.』
％Ｂ
「I'd like Chef Rikka's daily special, then.」
Rikka
『Hehe... Geez. That's the same answer. Don't complain if I just make it all vegetables, okay?』

％Ｂ
「That's fine with me. You'd cook it so it tastes great just for me anyway, right?」
Rikka
『I don't know about that. Maybe you'll open the lid and it's just filled with raw vegetables.』
％Ｂ
「I could even eat that if I had some special Rikka-made dressing to go with it.」
％Ｂ
「Anyway, I'm gonna start making dinner, so...」
Rikka
『Mhm... See you tomorrow.』
％Ｂ
「See you.」
_smh_st_04
I deliberately don't say "tomorrow" before hanging up.
％Ｂ
「All right, let's get ready.」
Not for making dinner, of course.
I definitely can't do this in pajamas.
I head back up to my room.
％Ｂ
「Uooooooohhhh!! My umbrellaaaaaa!!」
The rod snaps in half, and the transparent plastic goes flying off into the sky.
％Ｂ
「This hurricane's crazy!」
The violent wind threatens to rip my feet away from underneath me.
The umbrella didn't help. My pants are soaked through, and my shoes are filled with water and they feel gross.

％Ｂ
「But I've managed to get to the bus stop.」
There's still a decent amount of distance between Rikka's apartment complex and the bus stop that's the closest one to her, but the bus is still way better than walking.

I may not have an umbrella anymore, but I should be able to just run the remaining distance after getting off... Or at least I hope so.
...
......
.........
％Ｂ
「...It's late.」
I've waited for about fifteen minutes, but there's no bus.
I'm not surprised there aren't any other people waiting for it considering the weather...
I shove my hand in my pocket so I can check the bus schedule, and that's when I realize my mistake.

％Ｂ
「...I forgot my phone at home.」
Now I remember. I left it in the living room after getting off the phone with Rikka.

What do I do... It's not like it's out of the question for me to double back to get it.
But I don't want to waste any more time than I already have.
I want to see Rikka as soon as possible.
％Ｂ
「Whoa!?」
Something suddenly flies right in front of me.
It clangs heavily as it rolls across the ground. It's a construction sign.
％Ｂ
「There's even stuff like that flying around... That wouldn't have been just a scratch if it had hit me...」

The wind and rain are only getting stronger. Things are finally starting to feel dangerous.
And that's when a certain possibility crosses my mind.
％Ｂ
「...Are the buses not running?」
I can imagine it might be delayed, but I've waited for a while now and it still isn't here.

It's much more probable that it's not running at all.
I'd know in an instant if I just had my phone...
％Ｂ
「Should I wait a little longer... Or try running through this...」
Going home isn't even an option worth considering.
Running through this hurricane is an insanely stupid idea.
This weather snapped my umbrella clean in half.
The smart idea is to wait.
I know that.
％Ｂ
「...Hope I don't get sick.」
I put my jacket over my head and run out from the bus stop.
I've finally managed to get to Rikka's apartment complex.
All of my clothes, including my jacket and socks, are heavy with water.
I press the button for Rikka's apartment on the intercom.
％Ｂ
「...Huh?」
Nothing.
I try pressing it again.
％Ｂ
「No way. Is there a blackout in the area?」
I look around. It's not just this building. All of the streetlights and houses are dark around here.

Maybe one of the lines is down.
I've heard about how sign posts or trees can be blown into power lines and damage them.

％Ｂ
「You're kidding... After I got all the way here.」
I can't even get into contact with Rikka.
The fact I forgot my phone's come back to bite me yet again.
％Ｂ
「I'll just have to wait until the power's back...」
I find myself without any options before the cold, solid door.
％Ｂ
「...Hm? So how do people who live here get in and out during a blackout?」

You can probably get out through an emergency exit, but you wouldn't be able to get in without someone letting you in from inside.

I doubt it's set up so you have to wait until the system recovers.
％Ｂ
「Wait a second...」
I wedge my fingers into the doorway.
I slowly pull it open.
％Ｂ
「Oh, it opened!」
Looks like the auto-lock turns off during blackouts.
I slip through the slightly opened doorway and run up the emergency stairs.

I wonder how long it's been since the blackout started.
The only light in the dark room is the forlorn illumination from my phone.
The name of my beloved boyfriend is displayed on the screen.
I don't know how long I've been staring at it.
But I don't have the heart to tap on his name again.

Rikka
「...!」
I can't move. I sit on the couch, holding my knees to my chest.
I can hear the rain and wind unusually clearly.
And other than that, complete silence.
Doubt and fear press against me.
Blackouts have happened before.
I never thought of them as scary then...
...No.
It's not that I didn't think of them as scary... It's that I didn't try to.

Because I was fine by myself.
Because I was used to it.
Because I always told myself I would be fine.
Rikka
「...I'm so weak. So much weaker than I thought...」
I met Ryousuke, fell in love, and learned lots of new things about myself.
I met ％Ｂ, fell in love, and learned lots of new things about myself.
And I've been forced to realize just how weak I am countless times after I started dating Ryousuke.
And I've been forced to realize just how weak I am countless times after I started dating ％Ｂ.
I'm lonely when I'm alone.
I'm scared when I'm alone.
And that's because I've come to know the joy of being connected with someone.
Because I've come to know the warmth that can make me happy, body and soul.
I can't go back to the way I was.
Rikka
「I... wonder what I want to do.」
I'm starting to not know too well myself.
I'm causing trouble for Ryousuke, for Meguru, for everyone.
I'm causing trouble for ％Ｂ, for Meguru, for everyone.
My heart's tired and weak after thinking about it for several days...
I know this is all my own fault, but my heart's screaming.
Rikka
「Honestly...! What do I want to do...!?」
I press my face into my knees.
My white dress absorbs the tears welling up in my eyes.
Rikka
「...I know. I know that it's a pointless thing to worry about. It's just my unsightly envy. All I am is jealous... I... know that already...!」


Rikka
「I'm so happy for Meguru...! I can celebrate her achievements...! But I just can't make these miserable feelings disappear...!」
She's the younger sister I've always loved... the one I still love.
But... these feelings are...
Rikka
「How do I make them go away... How do I make them go away... I want them to go away... I want them to disappear...!」

Rikka
「...Maybe they won't go away... unless I disappear... It hurts... Save me... Save me...!」

My heart's ripping itself apart. I spit out my selfish thoughts.
I hold out my hand. I should have reached out sooner.
I can't do anything about this by myself...
Rikka
「Save me... Ryousuke...!」
Rikka
「Save me...!」
I jolt upright at the sound of knocking at the door.
Rikka
「...!! ...Wh-Who could that be? At a time like this? Is it a maintenance worker...?」
％Ｂ
「It's me! ％Ｂ! Rikka, open the door if you're there!!」
Rikka
「Wha...?」
Thump-thump...
My heart pounds for another reason altogether this time.
I hurry to the door and unlock it.
He's soaking wet, dripping all over, but without a doubt, it's Ryousuke.

He's soaking wet, dripping all over, but without a doubt, it's ％Ｂ.

％Ｂ
「Haha. My umbrella got blown away on the way here.」
％Ｂ
「Agh, it's cold. I might catch a cold. Sorry, but could I borrow a towel real quick?」

Rikka
「Why...! Why are you here...!?」
％Ｂ
「'Cause I wanted to see you. I just had to see you.」

Rikka
「You're so stupid!! Look at you, you're soaked!! You're insane to come here when it's like this outside!!」

Even though I'm happy.
Even though my heart's jumping for joy.
I can't stop myself from yelling at him.
％Ｂ
「Sorry.」
Rikka
「A cold might've been the least of your worries!!」
These aren't the words I want to say.
I know.
I know Ryousuke came because he was worried about me.
I know he came because he was worried about me.
And when he told me he'd come to see me over the phone, I started hoping he would.

I'm so unfair and cowardly that I'd wish for something like that without even thinking...
％Ｂ
「Yeah... but I wanted to see you.」
No matter how angry I get, he just smiles warmly at me.
I love seeing him smile.
This smile's saved me time and time again.
Rikka
「But that doesn't mean... you had to...!」
For someone as hopeless as me, he...
Rikka
「Whyyy... Why...! Sniff, fhh... Whyyy～～...」

％Ｂ
「Rikka... Are you crying?」
And only then do I realize there's something hot streaking down my cheeks.

I cried during my birthday too... All I've been doing lately is crying.
I'm so weak.
％Ｂ
「Wha, why are you crying...?」
Rikka
「It's because you're so stupid!!」
I throw myself into his chest.
Rikka
「Waaaaaaaaahhhh!! Uuh, sniff... Waaaaaaahhh!!」

％Ｂ
「You're gonna get your pretty dress dirty. I'm completely soaked, so...」

Rikka
「I don't care!! If I keel over from catching the same cold as you, then that'd be just perfect!!」

％Ｂ
「I kinda wish you wouldn't, 'cause that'd just make me worry...」
Rikka
「Geez, sniff, ueeeh... You're so cold...! You're just so stupid!」
％Ｂ
「Sorry... You're really warm, Rikka.」
Rikka
「Stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid...!\nI love you!!」

％Ｂ
「Yeah. I love you too.」
He uses his big palm to pat me on the head gently, so gently... over and over.

Rikka
「Thank, you...! Snfhh... Thank you...! Thank yooou...!!」

Rikka
「Ueh... Thank you, hkh... Thank you... for coming... Fh, waahhhh!!」
I sob and thank him over and over.
He keeps petting me on the head.
Rikka
「That was the only thing I thought you might be able to wear. Is it too small?」
％Ｂ
「Just a bit. But it's really warm.」
The towel wasn't even close to enough, so Rikka's going to wash my clothes for me.

Rikka pulled out her dad's pajamas from the back of a drawer and let me wear them.
Thinking about how I'm at Rikka's house when she lives alone, wearing pajamas belonging to her father whom I've never met, is kind of scary.

I declined Rikka's offer to use her shower and instead chose to dry myself off as much as I could with a towel.
I didn't want to be away from Rikka's side for even a moment.
We hold each other on the couch, on the pretense of warming my now only slightly cold body.

Rikka has her face buried in the base of my neck.
Rikka
「A long time ago... I had a dream. That Meguru and I would both become professional pianists, and that we'd perform together.」

She slowly begins to tell the tale of their past as sisters.
Since she had been born into a musical family, the piano was a constant in her everyday life.

Maybe it was hereditary, or maybe it was for some other reason, but either way, she immediately became interested in the piano.

Her parents warmly watched over her burgeoning interest, and her mother Sayaka-san apparently put a lot of effort into teaching her.

Meguru-chan eventually started playing piano too, and the household came to constantly be filled with melodies.

Rikka
「But... it wasn't all fun. At first, just playing piano made me happy. My piano playing made Meguru... and my mom... and my dad happy.」
Rikka
「I liked participating in contests... and concerts, because I liked seeing lots of people smile...」

Rikka
「But the pianist's path narrows severely as you continue― it becomes a world of winners and losers, where you have to fight your way through.」

Rikka
「Sometimes Meguru and I would compete against each other in contests, and sometimes we'd enter as partners in duo contests.」

Rikka
「I placed higher than her at first because I had more experience... But Meguru had talent that I didn't have... You could call it genius. She had an instinctual grasp. Meguru was terrifying to me...」
Meguru
「Mamaaa! How do I play this part?」
Sayaka
「That part's a little difficult. Can you do it, Meguru?」
Meguru
「I'll do my best! Because I'm definitely going to learn to play like Onee-chan!」
Rikka
「...」
She was going to catch up.
She was going to surpass me.
That was the first time I had felt that fear so clearly.
Sayaka
「Rikka?」
Rikka
「Oh... I-I'd like it if you could teach me that part too. I want to review it together with Meguru.」
I didn't want her to catch up.
I didn't want to be surpassed.
My feelings grew frantic.
All I could do to prevent myself from being left behind was to just practice as much as I could.

Rikka
「...A pianist's performance has to be delicate. But their body and will have to be tough.」

％Ｂ
「What's that from?」
Rikka
「It's something my mom often said. I... couldn't become strong. I envied Meguru, and created an inferiority complex for myself...」

Rikka
「Why couldn't you give me talent? Why did you only give it to Meguru? I bore grudges against God and my parents like that too.」
Rikka
「I couldn't possibly face the piano earnestly like that... The gap between Meguru and me only grew and grew... and by the time I was in late grade school, the difference between us was like night and day.」

Rikka
「No matter the contest, Meguru would get first prize... She was called a musical prodigy... But I always had to work as hard as I could just to win any prize at all, and all I could do was watch her from the sidelines.」

Rikka's hands... and legs... Her whole body's trembling.
I hold her tightly against me.
％Ｂ
「You don't have to force yourself to keep talking.」
Rikka
「...No. I want you to hear all of this. Because I... want you to know everything about me.」

％Ｂ
「Rikka...」
％Ｂ
「Okay. Tell me.」
Rikka
「...Mhm. I'll continue where I left off... I was rotten inside, but Meguru was so kind. She would be my partner in duo contests, even though she knew I would only drag her down.」
Rikka
「But I just couldn't accept Meguru's kindness... because playing side by side only made the difference between us more apparent than if we were playing separately.」

Rikka
「I was always more worried about the judges' reactions than about my performance.」

Rikka
「I'd tell them in my head... "I know I don't belong here"... "Please don't frown at me like that"... "Don't look at me like I'm something to be pitied"... "It'll be over soon"...」

Rikka
「I received advice from many different people. I knew my faults, and I'd like to think I tried to improve. But I never understood how I could achieve something abstract like getting an instinctual grasp of music.」
Rikka
「It was something Meguru had gotten naturally, but I could never obtain myself... I couldn't think of it as anything other than the difference in our talent.」

Rikka
「We were only able to place first in a duo contest just once because of how I dragged Meguru down. We fell just short all the other times. And that's when...」

We came in third place in the contest on that day, and it was because of me again.
I realized I had forgotten something in the waiting room as I was leaving the contest venue.

I smelled cigarettes and heard a familiar voice from the break room as I was running back to go get it.

The voice belonged to a judge whom I had met many times in the past at contests, and had always given me advice.

Judge A
「Narusawa Meguru... She's good. There's rumors that she already has a major record label approaching her for a contract.」

Judge A
「I'm sure she'll be able to make it on the world stage in the very near future. I'd teach her myself if she weren't already Narusawa Sayaka's daughter.」

Judge B
「I'm sure the world would take notice of Narusawa Meguru's level of talent even without you teaching her, Kado-san. She'd take flight on her own power even if we just left her be, don't you think?」

Judge A
「Hahaha, no doubt about that. And she's Narusawa Sayaka's very own daughter on top of that. She's got her name and her connections. It's hard to imagine her failing.」

Judge B
「Speaking of her being Narusawa Sayaka's daughter... What do you think of her older sister who was playing with her? I've heard you've given her advice many times.」

Judge A
「I won't say she's unskilled. I'll acknowledge that she's put in the effort. She's got plenty of technique.」

Judge A
「But she doesn't have anything more.」
Rikka
「...!」
My heart was too loud.
Its gross thumpings and poundings just wouldn't stop.
Rikka
「Hgh... gh...」
...I already knew.
I knew since a long time ago...
I knew that Meguru would be better off without me...!
But I liked playing piano...!
I liked seeing lots of people smile...!
I wanted lots more people to hear my piano playing...!
And I wanted to become a pianist...!
Judge A
「There are countless people who want to become professional pianists. A handful of them have the ability to do it, and an even smaller portion can actually sell it.」

Judge A
「Our world doesn't run on effort alone. Giving up and pursuing another path once you realize you don't have the talent will make you happier in the long run.」

Judge A
「It wouldn't be worth anything if anyone could obtain it because they wanted it. And there are things that you can never obtain, no matter how much you want them.」

Rikka
「...It came as a shock. Especially since it was someone whom I thought was on my side. But strangely enough... I didn't feel any anger or sadness.」

Rikka
「"I see... So other people really were thinking the same thing." I guess it just made sense to me...」

Rikka
「Thinking about it now... I'm sure there must have been some rebellious part of me that kept telling myself that I'd be able to do it if I tried, until I heard the words spoken out loud.」
Rikka
「That part of me just snapped away entirely... and after that, I stopped entering contests.」

Rikka
「Both my parents and Meguru seemed to have more or less realized. Meguru tried to get me to enter contests over and over to try to encourage me, and I found myself seeing that as unpleasant...」
Rikka
「I thought things like, "There's no way she could understand how I feel... Someone like her, who could move forward exactly how she wanted...! She couldn't possibly understand how I felt, and how much pain this caused me!"」
Rikka
「I loved Meguru, but I couldn't love her in regard to piano...」

Rikka
「That's why... when it was decided that Meguru would go overseas, I couldn't bring myself to say that I would go with her...」
Sayaka
「Rikka. Do you remember Mr. Heim? You met him once at a recital.」

I remembered the elegant and refined way he would play not with his upper body, but by holding his forearms and fingers parallel to the keys and swinging them downward.
Rikka
「...What about Mr. Heim?」
Sayaka
「He's agreed to teach Meguru. But Mr. Heim lives in Austria, so we have to move.」

Rikka
「When?」
Sayaka
「Around the beginning of summer break. Your father and I are currently looking for a house over there.」

Meguru
「Onee-chan, let's have him teach us together.」
Rikka
「...Do I have to go too?」
Sayaka
「You... don't have to. But you'd have to live by yourself if you don't.」

Rikka
「I can do it. I can cook, do laundry, and clean... I've been doing it all by myself anyway. I'm not going. I'm staying here alone.」
Meguru
「...Onee-chan... But...」
Rikka
「I'm sorry.」
Meguru
「Hgh... Then... Then! I want just one thing from you, Onee-chan!」

Meguru shows me a sheaf of handwritten sheet music.
Only two copies of this sheet music exist in the world.
The piano four hands arrangement of "A Fragment of Emotion."
Mom gave these to us to celebrate the one time we had been able to place first in a duo contest.
Meguru and I had promised that we would both become pianists one day and play this together, in front of lots of people.

Meguru
「Let's play this together at the next duo contest! We're allowed to play duo arrangements for the performer-selected piece!」

Meguru
「Please! Onee-chan!」
...I don't have any talent. I'd just drag Meguru down.
Because... I'm not of the same base quality as Meguru or Mom.
It's a difference borne of being blessed with talent. No amount of effort can make up for it.

If there exists a god of piano, I...
Was unloved by them.
Meguru
「We might not be able to play together once I move. So...」

Rikka
「Meguru... I've realized I don't want to become a pianist.」
Meguru
「Wha... Onee...chan?」
Rikka
「I just enjoy playing piano, that's all.」
Meguru
「...We promised we'd both... become pianists, and play this...」
Rikka
「You'll just have to become a pianist alone. I'm sorry.」
Rikka
「...I can still remember how Meguru looked like she might cry when I said that. My family moved, I stayed behind in Japan, and that should have been the end...」
Rikka
「...I was supposed to have given up on piano, but I'm still wretchedly clinging to it. But I don't have the courage to enter contests...」
Rikka
「I'm afraid...! That they might look at me with those eyes again...! That they might compare me to Meguru again...! I'm so scared I don't know what to do with myself!」
It's a scream from the bottom of her heart.
She won't stop criticizing herself.
Rikka
「I'm living in the home my parents bought, living off the money my parents send me, without working to earn anything...!」

Rikka
「I ran away to the piano at school, because the piano at home reminds me of Meguru and my mom's playing...!」

Rikka
「All I do is just pointlessly play the piano, and I can't find anything else I want to do...! I'm doing nothing but just staying alive, day after day!」
Rikka's making her actions sound negative, but I don't think that's the truth...
It's because she likes the piano... Because she loves it.
And the stronger those feelings toward the piano are, the harder it is to actually give up on it.
I think about how I might feel if I found myself running against an insurmountable wall getting in the way of my dream to be an architect... It's painful.

It would be far too painful for me to just give up honorably.
Rikka
「I'm mediocre in every single way...! My piano playing isn't worth anything!!」

Glittering droplets gleam in the dim room as she finishes saying all that she has to say.
I wipe her tears away with my finger.
I hold the back of her head and press her tightly against me, and pat her reassuringly on her back.

％Ｂ
「...」
Rikka's incredibly clumsy about this kind of stuff.
She's had these doubts all this time, bearing them alone.
I want to protect her...
I immediately sweep that thought from my mind.
I think that might not be the right thing to think.
That probably isn't what Rikka wants.
I'm sure she still wants to play piano together with Meguru-chan.
Protecting her would get in the way of that.
What I want to do... What I should do...
―Is support Rikka from beside her, and push her from behind.
％Ｂ
「Hey, Rikka... I've told you about how I wanna be an architect, right?」

Rikka
「...Mhm.」
％Ｂ
「I'll be honest. I've never thought about whether or not I'll be able to become a professional like you have.」
％Ｂ
「So what I'm about to say might be really naive, and I might be underestimating how the world works. But I want you to listen to what I have to say.」

Rikka
「...」
She gives a silent, tiny nod.
％Ｂ
「...Thanks.」
％Ｂ
「I used to work part-time at the architecture firm of someone I knew, and I had them write me a reference letter for Mr. Azuma when I moved here.」

％Ｂ
「Mr. Azuma's the architect I admire most. I respect him a lot, and I wanna be like him someday.」

％Ｂ
「I had him interview me... and I thought I was gonna get it. I was confident in my model-making ability, and I thought I had the talent for it.」

％Ｂ
「But I failed. Pretty badly, too.」
％Ｂ
「I was told I'd definitely make the same mistakes again. I had no excuses to give after he pointed out exactly what I did wrong.」

％Ｂ
「And he even gave me advice about how I should immerse myself in what I can only do now. Mr. Azuma's amazing. I knew for sure I respected him that day.」
％Ｂ
「I was disappointed that I didn't get to work under him, but that doesn't mean I won't ever be able to do any work, right?」

％Ｂ
「If I work hard and try again, then he might approve of me in the future... Though I guess there's also the chance he won't.」
％Ｂ
「But I'm not gonna give up.」
％Ｂ
「If a building falls, then I can build a new one. I'll keep moving forward like that, bit by bit.」

Rikka
「You're so strong... I can't be that strong.」
％Ｂ
「You are, Rikka.」
％Ｂ
「Suuuh... hahhh... Aaah, ah, ah, ah, ahhh...」
I suddenly start doing vocalization practice.
And then I sing.
I sing the song she helped me practice for the retake of my music practical exam.
Rikka's eyes go wide at my sudden singing.
I sing the entire song a cappella for her.
％Ｂ
「I'm sorry, Rikka. I didn't realize.」
％Ｂ
「It's not just contests... You don't like playing in front of others at all, right?」
Rikka
「...Mhm. I get worried when people watch, and I get doubtful... Sometimes, I get scared.」
She can be reassured if it's friends she doesn't need to be reserved around.
But what if it's otherwise...?
I wonder how Rikka felt when she said she would play the piano with me for my retake.

She did her best for my sake, even though she didn't want to play.
Rikka's a kind girl... One who can be strong for the sake of others.
I'd like it if she could direct that strength toward herself too.
％Ｂ
「It's thanks to you that I can sing like this, and it's thanks to you that I think music's fun now.」

％Ｂ
「You taught me this, so I want you to have confidence.」
％Ｂ
「I like your piano playing, Rikka. So do Segawa, Shinozaki, Ousaka, Okihara-senpai, Yukimura, and Shuuichi... I think everyone does.」

Rikka
「That's because... You all haven't heard actually amazing piano playing...」
％Ｂ
「But I heard Meguru-chan perform live just the other day. On the exact same piano. I didn't think yours was inferior to hers.」
％Ｂ
「When I heard you play the first time, I wondered why you looked so sad when you played.」
％Ｂ
「But it looks like you've been having a lot of fun lately. I feel like you've been having just as much fun as Meguru-chan... No, even more fun than she does when you play.」

Rikka
「...It's because I met you... because I met all of you. Everything's started to seem fun to me recently...」

Rikka
「Um... Do you remember that time when you fell asleep in the music classroom?」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, I do. That was the first time we walked home together.」
Rikka
「Do you remember... how I played the piano even though you were there?」
％Ｂ
「Oh yeah, now that you mention it...」
I remember Segawa and the others said Rikka always stopped playing when people came by.

Rikka
「Seeing you nod off reminded me of how comfortable Meguru looked when she took naps with my piano playing as her lullaby.」
Rikka
「And that let me feel warmer... I think that might have been the point at which I started changing, little by little.」

％Ｂ
「So that means that the way you play now started after meeting us, right?」

％Ｂ
「So if you're gonna say your playing isn't good, then wouldn't you be saying the same thing about your relationships with us?」

Rikka
「...Gh. That's not fair... I can't say it's bad if you say something like that.」

Her voice... and her breathing in my ear are calmer than before.
Bur Rikka... doesn't show her agreement with me.
The luminescent paint of the clock's hour hand dimly points to the ceiling in the dark room.

It's midnight, but the lights are still out.
At this rate, the power might not recover until morning.
I couldn't just leave Rikka like that, so I decided to stay the night at her place.

I'm sure Meguru-chan wouldn't be angry for today.
Rikka
「Um... We can do it, if you want. It's uncomfortable for you, isn't it? I can feel it rubbing against my thigh.」

My hopeless son's uncontrollably honest, even at a time like this...
Sleeping together with her, in the bed that's filled with her scent... To be honest, I wanna do it so bad it hurts.

But...
％Ｂ
「Sorry. I can't really do anything about this, so just ignore it.」
％Ｂ
「I'm fine for today. But I wanna hold you like this instead.」

Rikka
「Oh...!」
I wrap my arms around her back and envelop myself around her slender, small frame.
Rikka
「It's rubbing against me even more now...」
％Ｂ
「I want you to ignore that too.」
Rikka
「Okay... I will. Hehe. Thank you...」
She buries her face in my chest.
Rikka
「These pajamas are definitely too small on you. It's tight across your chest. Maybe I should buy pajamas for you the next time I go shopping.」
％Ｂ
「That's a very attractive offer, but I dunno if I'd be able to control myself anymore if you did that.」
I'd wanna stay over at Rikka's every night.
％Ｂ
「So, in the future... we can buy them together once we're living together, or when we're getting married.」

Rikka
「Living together with you... Getting married to you...～～!」
I can't see her face, but I can clearly tell she's blushing.
％Ｂ
「That's what I'm planning on, you know. Right now it'd be kinda hard, but... yeah, maybe during university or something.」

％Ｂ
「Don't you think going to the same university and living together sounds great?」

Rikka
「Going to the same university as you and living together... That's... It really sounds like something out of a dream.」

％Ｂ
「Right? But that might become reality if we want it to. I don't plan on breaking things off ever, so I don't think we'd ever break up unless you end up hating me or stop loving me.」

Rikka
「I can't even imagine being the one to break up. I could never be with anyone else but you.」

％Ｂ
「Looks like we're living together in the future for sure, then.」
Rikka
「Hehehe... Looks like it. I'd be so happy every day if I got to live with you. I'd be so happy I could die.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. So we can save the pajamas for then.」

I smile, and Rikka looks up at me with her own smile.
There are still some remnants of tears in her eyes, but her cute smile's returned.
Seeing that puts me a little at ease.
％Ｂ
「Night.」
Rikka
「Good night.」
all
I'm gonna do everything I can so I can live a happy life with Rikka.

I make my vow, and close my eyes too.
