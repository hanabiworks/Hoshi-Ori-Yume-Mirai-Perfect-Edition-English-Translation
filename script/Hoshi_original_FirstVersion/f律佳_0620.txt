The lunch break bell rings. The cafeteria-goers all clear out of the classroom, and those who brought lunchboxes start pulling their desks and chairs together. 

I used to be a part of all this, but now I go to the music classroom on a daily basis.

Narusawa's music lessons are a lot of work, but I really enjoy being with her.

％Ｂ
「Narusawa. Let's go together once you're ready.」
Rikka
「Oh... I'm sorry. I can't today.」
％Ｂ
「Got something to do?」
Rikka
「I got mail just earlier about work for the concert group. I need to go to the committee room.」

％Ｂ
「Right, you guys are gonna decide on who's in the Shio-cademy Fest soon.」
Rikka
「Yes. That's apparently what it's about.」
％Ｂ
「Can I come with, then? I might be able to help with something.」

Rikka
「You don't have to, since it isn't your work.」
％Ｂ
「The event committee's motto is that we help each other out, right?」
Rikka
「Well aren't you diligent. Hehe, shall we go?」
Ishizuka
「And with this, everyone we've extended offers to has responded. It's a shame about everyone who declined, of course.」

Ishizuka
「But Narusawa-san's younger sister saying yes is great. Narusawa-san, did you ask her to?」
Rikka
「No, I didn't do anything. It seems Meguru decided that on her own.」
Ishizuka
「Did she really? Still, thank you. We'll send out our own message of thanks, but could you tell her as well?」


Rikka
「I will.」
all
Ishizuka
「Now then, let's get right to work. We've finished looking into the student applicants, so I need everyone to split up and give them notice.」

Ishizuka-san hands out printouts to each of the concert team's members.

Ishizuka
「The list says who's in charge of what. The year and class of the representative members of each of the groups that passed are written there, so hand them the notice printouts.」

Ishizuka
「You'll also need to explain to representatives of groups that failed that they weren't accepted, and give them the printouts that state the reason why.」

Ishizuka
「If they start getting difficult, then don't try to resolve anything. Tell them to make a statement to the committee at a later point.」

％Ｂ
「Excuse me, is there anything I can help with?」
Ishizuka
「Then could you support Narusawa-san?」
％Ｂ
「You want me... to support her? I've only been in the committee for a week more than her, you know.」
Ishizuka
「You can call me if anything you don't understand comes up. You'll be more confident going with two people, right?」

％Ｂ
「I see. I understand. I'll hold the printouts, Narusawa.」
I extend my hand. Narusawa looks at me blankly for a bit, but then she smiles warmly and hands me the sheaf of paper.

It's not any more than twenty or so printouts, but the guy should still be the one to hold this.

Rikka
「Thank you. What order should we go in?」
％Ｂ
「I think we can just start with what's closest.」
Rikka
「Please excuse us.」
％Ｂ
「Just four more left now. Looks like we'll be able to get through all of them by the end of lunch break.」
We've steadily made our way through the list.
It looks like Ishizuka-san was being considerate of Narusawa. Our list doesn't seem to include any troublemakers.

There were a few people who were out for lunch, but all we really have to do is go to their classrooms and hand over the printouts, so it's easy work.

Rikka
「Looks like... the next one is the class next door. They're a girls band, and the representative is a third year named Asakura.」

％Ｂ
「Excuse me! Is Asakura-senpai here?」
Asakura
「Oh, yes! I'm Asakura!」
A girl stands up amidst a group of other girls and raises her hand at us.

I'm glad she was in her classroom.
％Ｂ
「We're from the event organization committee. We're here to let you know of the status of your application to perform in the Shio-cademy Fest.」


Rikka
「You have passed review. This printout explains in further detail.」
Asakura
「A-Aaahh～」
all
...What's wrong?
She doesn't seem too happy about getting to perform.
Asakura
「I'm sorry. I know this is reeeally rude of me, but is it okay if we withdraw our application?」

Rikka
「We can still change the program, so there shouldn't be any issue. But may we ask for the reason?」

Asakura
「Our drummer ducked out, so we can't play the song we were planning on playing.」

all
％Ｂ
「...I see.」
％Ｂ
「We understand your situation.」
They want to participate in the Tanabata Festival, but they can't... They're like Okihara-senpai and Ousaka.
Then we should be the ones to step in here.
％Ｂ
「Is there anything the event committee can do to help?」
％Ｂ
「For example, perhaps we could try looking for another person to play the drums...」
Asakura
「Thanks. But there's no point if it isn't her... but... I don't think she'd want to.」

％Ｂ
「Is that so...」
％Ｂ
「I understand. Then we will mark you down as not participating.」

Asakura
「I'm soooo sorry. We're all going our separate ways after graduating, so we thought we could do this as one final memory. I guess things just don't work out.」


Rikka
「...」
Asakura
「I hope it'll be a wonderful Shio-cademy Fest.」
％Ｂ
「Yes. Thank you very much.」
％Ｂ
「It's a shame that they can't participate even though they want to...」
Rikka
「It is...」
I wish I could support them like I'm doing for Okihara-senpai and Ousaka.
But it's hard to intervene when delicate emotions are involved.
％Ｂ
「Let's move on, Narusawa. Where to next?」
There's no point on dwelling on this when I can't think of any good ideas.

Let's just get our current job done.
We were able to get through the entire list before the end of lunch break.
％Ｂ
「Oh...」
My stomach rumbles.
Rikka
「Pff... Hehe... Hehehe... You have a really loud stomach.」
％Ｂ
「I'm suddenly really hungry now that I've remembered I didn't eat lunch...」
Rikka
「It's because you wanted to do everything during lunch break. We could've done it after school. There's still time. Let's eat in the music classroom.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, let's do that.」
Rikka
「I'm sorry. I couldn't find the sheet music.」
all
Sora
「...That's a shame. But there's nothing we can do about that.」
Misa
「I'm sure you must have looked for a very long time! Thank you very much!」

all
Marika
「But what should we do, then... Oh, maybe the concert band might have the sheet music.」


Natsuki
「I dunno if it's the concert band's, but I've seen a few in the room next door to them. But won't it be hard to get them to lend those out?」


Misa
「That may be true... They are school property.」
all
Rikka
「I'll go buy the sheet music tomorrow. I think they should have it at the music store on 1st Street.」

％Ｂ
「I'll talk to Shuuichi about that, then. Maybe we could get the committee to cover it.」
Rikka
「There's no need. Sometimes you need to write on sheet music, and I wanted to play it again anyway.」


Misa
「I feel rather apologetic for forcing an errand upon you on a day off.」

Rikka
「I'll be doing it as part of other errands and grocery shopping, so please don't pay it any mind.」

Misa
「Then please at least allow me to help you with the bags! I am quite confident in my physical strength, you know.」

Sora
「We're supposed to go catch fish tomorrow and the day after.」
Misa
「Oh, yes...」
all
Sora
「
Ryou 
You 
can go.」
％Ｂ
「Wha?」
Rikka
「What?」
％Ｂ
「M-Me? I mean, I'm totally fine if it's just holding bags, but...」


Misa
「Yes! That is a very wonderful suggestion! 
Ryousuke-san 
He 
is strong, so it will make your shopping much easier!」
％Ｂ
「But... is it really okay?」
I'm supposed to be helping Okihara-senpai and the others with catching fish those days too.

Misa
「Yes. Sora-san, Marika-san, and Natsuki-san will all be helping me tomorrow.」

Sora
「Misa needs to be there. You're not as necessary
, Ryou

.」
％Ｂ
「You're exactly right about that, but I wish you could've said it at least a little nicer...」

all
Though I get that she's talking about from the perspective of identifying fish.

Rikka
「Wait a second. Don't start deciding on things without me! I can go shopping by myself...」
Sora
「We're not okay with that.」
％Ｂ
「Come on, Narusawa. You'll be able to buy the heavy stuff you wouldn't usually be able to if I'm there.」

I want to help Narusawa out, of course.
But I also just wanna be together with her.

Marika
「Narusawa-san, why not have 
Hino-kun 
him 
help you?」
She smiles brightly as she asks.
all
Rikka
「Why are you all so...? ...Sigh. Fine.」

Rikka
「I'll see you tomorrow then
, Hino-kun
