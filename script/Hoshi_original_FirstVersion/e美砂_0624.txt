Marika
「
Hino-kun～
U-Umm～
」
Shinozaki comes into my classroom as the bell for the end of second period rings.
％Ｂ
「Hey, Shinozaki. What are you so frantic for?」
Marika
「I got a reply～」
％Ｂ
「A reply? Oh... You mean from the people from the pool.」
She had sent Okihara-senpai's idea to get rid of the kids' fear of water to the people at her part-time job at the pool.

She must've gotten a response back.
％Ｂ
「So what'd they say?」
Marika
「The other instructors said it seems interesting, so we should definitely try it～」

％Ｂ
「Seriously!? That's amazing!」

Natsuki
「What's going on here? Something interesting again?」
all
I tell Segawa about what happened yesterday.
Narusawa's listening from her seat next to mine too.
Natsuki
「Huh, Misa-san's idea, eh?」
Rikka
「...I could see how that method could lessen the kids' fear.」

％Ｂ
「I hope it works out that way.」
all
Marika
「I hope we can try it out when I go help out the swimming class next time～」

％Ｂ
「When's that?」
Marika
「This Saturday.」
％Ｂ
「Saturday... That's pretty soon.」
Marika
「Oh～ ...Yeah, maybe too soon? I was thinking I'd try hard to do it. They said they'd provide the money for the construction...」


％Ｂ
「What, you were planning on doing it all on your own?」
Marika
「I was thinking of getting the teacher to help too... but we're usually pretty busy, so now that I think about it, we might not have enough time... I think.」

％Ｂ
「No, I think you can do it. And I'll help too.」

Marika
「What, really～?」
％Ｂ
「Of course. Leave it to me. But still, we've only got four days... We'll need to work fast to get it done.」

Let's get Okihara-senpai to help too, since she thought of this in the first place.
all
After school.
We bought the materials we'd need to make the stuff they'd need for the swimming classroom, and we've come back to my place.

％Ｂ
「Please, come in. There's no need to be shy, it's just me here anyway.」

Misa
「Yes, excuse me then.」
She bows and quietly enters.
Okihara-senpai immediately agreed to help once we told her what was going on.

Marika
「Excuse me～」
Shinozaki hesitantly follows after her.
Misa
「Your house is very wonderful.」
Marika
「This kinda makes me nervous～」
％Ｂ
「You've been here before, Shinozaki.」
Misa
「Oh, is that true?」
Marika
「I-I just walked into the entranceway to pick him up before school. This is my first time going inside too.」

％Ｂ
「Wait, really?」
all
Marika
「Yeah... I think it'd be a good idea not to say things that might make Okihara-senpai misunderstand～」

％Ｂ
「What's that mean?」
Marika
「Mmm～ ...If you don't understand, then that's okay...」
What a weirdo.
％Ｂ
「Hup.」
I lay out the materials we've bought on the desk.
Waterproof sticker kits and colored markers.
That's all.
This is the idea that Okihara-senpai thought of.
Stick drawings of fish onto the bottom of the pool to get kids interested in diving into the water, and lessen their fear that way.


％Ｂ
「It's a lot cheaper than getting them to swim together with fish in a giant fish tank.」

The kids should be happier the more fish there are, so I just went and bought five sticker sets.\n\r

We should be able to make somewhere between three to five stickers per set.
We can use a normal printer to print out the stickers, so we've decided to use mine.

％Ｂ
「All right, let's go over the steps.」
Marika
「Okaaay.」
％Ｂ
「First, we draw the fish and color them in. We'll scan those in with the scanner, print them out onto the sticker paper, and then use them as waterproof stickers.」


％Ｂ
「The main point for this is gonna be the drawings. I've already seen Okihara-senpai draw, so that's fine, but... Shinozaki, you'll be... fine, right?」


Marika
「I-I can at least draw fish too～」
Marika
「I just need to draw them in a way to get the kids interested, right? I think you can leave it to me～」

％Ｂ
「All right. I'll do that, then.」
And so Okihara-senpai and Shinozaki are in charge of the illustration.
I'll be in charge of printing and waterproofing.
Misa
「Shall we begin, then?」
Marika
「Okaaay. I'll do my best!」
all
Marika
「I'm dooone!」
％Ｂ
「Oh, done already? Give it here then, I'll scan it in.」

Marika
「Here you go. What do you think? It looks like a fish, right?」

％Ｂ
「...Uhh... Well... It's a fish all right.」
It's the kind of drawing that anyone could do.
I have absolutely no idea what specific kind of fish it's supposed to be...

all
Misa
「I have also finished.」
％Ｂ
「Then I'll take yours, too.」
And to compare, her drawing is...
％Ｂ
「...It's a neon damselfish.」
Misa
「Oh, you can tell?」
％Ｂ
「Yes... It's easy with how realistic the drawing is.」
It's a genuinely realistic-looking drawing of a blue neon damselfish.

all
I place their drawings down side by side.
Shinozaki's drawing is really girly and adorable.
And compared to that is Okihara-senpai's drawing, which looks like something I could find in a field guide.
％Ｂ
「It's kind of... an extreme difference.」
This isn't gonna confuse the kids, is it?
Well, there's apparently more than one children's pool, and I'm sure they'd be happy with a lot of variety...\n\r

Probably.
％Ｂ
「Then I'll scan these in and print them out.」
I feed their drawings into the scanner, one at a time.
After taking the drawings and using image editing software to adjust the sizes and such, I print them out onto the special paper from the sticker kit.

I place the waterproof film over the printed-out stickers and cut them out along the outlines. Done.

％Ｂ
「Okay... There we go.」
And now we have two fish stickers.
Misa
「How very nice! Wonderful!」
Marika
「Wow～ They're more legitimate stickers than I thought.」
％Ｂ
「Well yeah, that's what the kit's for.」
％Ｂ
「Anyway, let's just keep pumping them out like that.」
Marika
「Yeah～!」
Misa
「I'll do my best!」
％Ｂ
「Phew... And that makes seven.」
Marika
「Hahhh... I'm tired～」
％Ｂ
「It's getting dark out, so maybe we should call it a day here. We can keep going tomorrow. Okihara-senpai, let's stop for today.」


all
Misa
「...」
％Ｂ
「Okihara-senpai?」
She continues to draw intently, apparently not having heard me.

％Ｂ
「Excuse me...」
Misa
「Oh, yes? What is it?」
％Ｂ
「Let's stop for today. We can pick up where we left off tomorrow.」
Misa
「What? ...Are we done already?」
％Ｂ
「Already? It's already completely dark out.」
Misa
「What? ...Oh, it is. I didn't even notice...」
％Ｂ
「Won't your family be worried if you don't go home soon? Same for you, right, Shinozaki?」

Marika
「It's fine for me, since I live close by...」
Misa
「Um... Would it be okay for me to just finish this drawing? I'd like to finish this no matter what.」

％Ｂ
「You don't need to be in such a hurry... but if you really insist.」

Misa
「Thank you very much!」
all
She immediately goes right back into drawing.
Shinozaki and I quietly peer at her drawing. What's got her so driven?

％Ｂ
「Oh...」
Marika
「It's a fish with a blue body, and spots that look like stars... Is this a yellowtail wrasse?」

％Ｂ
「It is...」
I kinda get why she just has to finish this drawing, now that I've seen it.

This is her favorite fish.
It may just be a drawing, but she probably can't bear to leave it half done.
％Ｂ
「She really must love that fish... and the ocean too...」
Marika
「Mhm... Yeah.」
all
She looks happy as she draws the yellowtail wrasse.
I just watch her draw, a smile on my face.
