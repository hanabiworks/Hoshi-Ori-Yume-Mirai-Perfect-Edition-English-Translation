Firm Staff A
「Man, you really helped me out the other day. It's my treat today, so feel free to drink a bit hesitantly.」

He's talking about when we had that work conversation late at night the other day.
％Ｂ
「Don't you mean "drink as much as you want"?」

Firm Staff A
「Drink moderately, then.」
％Ｂ
「I think I'll drink as much as I want. Excuse me, one draft beer for now!!」

Firm Staff A
「You're cheeky for a newlywed...」
％Ｂ
「I don't think being a newlywed has anything to do with it.」
Firm Staff A
「Shut up, I'm jealous, okay? So... how's the newlywed life treating you?」

％Ｂ
「Well... Not bad, I guess?」
Firm Staff A
「What's "not bad" supposed to mean? If it's good then just say it's good! That humble part of you's got me feeling like I've lost too...」


％Ｂ
「W-Well... Yes, it is nice...」
That's right. My newlywed life is wonderful.
To be honest, I'm kind of terrified of how happy I am.
But I wouldn't want to brag about it.
Firm Staff A
「But I hear you've got it pretty rough? With the Oonos.」
％Ｂ
「Oh yeah, it's a huge problem. They want a sudden change of plans.」

Firm Staff A
「A shotgun wedding for their son, I hear? How is that all you people are getting married like no tomorrow, but I can't make it at all...」


％Ｂ
「The conversation's taken a bit of an intimate turn, hasn't it...」
％Ｂ
「Well, they're quite difficult to make anyway...」
Firm Staff A
「Hm? What's that mean?」
％Ｂ
「Oh, no, nothing...」
I inadvertently started talking about us.
We've really gotten into the childmaking mood since then, and so we've been going at it with every intention of making one...

But there aren't any signs along those lines as of now.
I figured it'd be easy as pie to do if we just didn't use contraceptives, but I guess it's actually pretty difficult.

Firm Staff A
「So how are things going with the Oono residence? The contractor doesn't like it, right?」

％Ｂ
「Well, I tried pretty hard to ask him, and finally managed to get him to agree.」
Firm Staff A
「Wow, I'm surprised that foreman said okay to that. He's the kinda stubborn old man you don't see much of anymore, isn't he?」

％Ｂ
「I went to the construction site for a while, helped out and stuff... and it looks like he's finally approved of me recently.」


Firm Staff A
「Hoh, you've gotten pretty good. Things are just different for newlyweds after all...」

％Ｂ
「Please don't link everything to being a newlywed.」
Though I guess he's right that knowing Marika's there for me when I get home is a huge motivator.

Firm Staff A
「I kinda want to drink a ton! All right! We're gonna drink 'til the break of dawn tonight!」

％Ｂ
「No, I'll be going home at a normal time...」
Eventually, after declining my coworker's invitation to go for another round, I return to my wonderful, wonderful newlywed home.

％Ｂ
「I'm hooome.」
Marika
「Oh, w-welcome back! I thought you were going to be home late tonight.」

％Ｂ
「The coworker I was drinking with said he didn't wanna keep a newlywed away from home for too long, 'cause he'd feel bad.」

Though it was actually the opposite...
Marika
「Oh really～ It's a bit messy right now, because I thought you'd be home later...」

It's like she says. The room's kinda cluttered.
But that's weird.
It's usually so tidy...
Marika
「U-Umm... Well, you know how it's your birthday soon? I've been preparing for that～」

She looks like a kid who's been spotted doing mischief.
We've talked about my birthday before already, and it's not like the date changes from year to year, so it shouldn't be a surprise or anything...

％Ｂ
「You gonna do something special?」
She always gives me a present and a homemade meal... but I guess that won't be all this year?

Marika
「That's something to look forward to on the day of! I hope you're excited. Do you think you'll be able to come home early that day?」


％Ｂ
「I think so. Or more like, if that's the case, then I'll make that my top priority.」

Marika
「That's great! I'll be waiting with lots of tasty food ready, then♪ And...」


And she goes red as she trails off.
％Ｂ
「And what?」
Marika
「Oh, nothing! Look forward to it, okay♪」
Marika
「More importantly... Umm... Your welcome-home kiss...」
％Ｂ
「Oh yeah, right. Okay, come here.」

Marika
「Mhm♪ Chu...」
It's a bit late, but we do our usual nighttime kiss.
This'll be my first birthday since we've been married. I'm kinda excited.
