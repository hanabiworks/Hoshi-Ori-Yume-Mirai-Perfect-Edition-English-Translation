Shuuichi
「So, how's it going with the astronomy club?」
％Ｂ
「...」
It's the weekly Monday progress report...
Which of course means I'm asked whether the astronomy club's decided to participate in the Tanabata Festival yet.
％Ｂ
「...I'll be upfront. No decision yet.」
Shuuichi
「I know that. You would've told me if there was. I'm asking if the astronomy club seems even a little interested in participating.」


％Ｂ
「It's not like the club's completely uninterested, of course... I think.」
Shuuichi
「...You really think I'm gonna just gloss over how vague that was?」
％Ｂ
「I didn't say it like that 'cause I wanted you to gloss over it...」
Shuuichi
「Sigh... I told you before. We don't have much time. Exams are coming up. We need to have everything decided before then.」


Shuuichi
「We'll start getting serious about preparing for the festival once exams are over. If the astronomy club doesn't participate, then I'm gonna have you help the other clubs, like we agreed on.」


％Ｂ
「I know that. But there's still at least a little time, right?」

Shuuichi
「...This week's gonna be it.」
％Ｂ
「This week, huh...」
Shuuichi
「If the astronomy club hasn't decided by the end of the week, then I'm sorry, but we'll have to rule that the club can't participate. So keep that in mind, all right?」


％Ｂ
「Got it. Thanks, Shuuichi.」
％Ｂ
「By the way, how are things going with the naturalist club?」
Shuuichi
「Narusawa and, for some reason, Yukimura are helping there. Looks like things are progressing pretty steadily for now.」

％Ｂ
「All right. I can't lose to them, can I? I'll try a little harder to convince Ousaka.」

Shuuichi
「Yeah, you do that. You can go now.」
I leave the committee office and head to the astronomy clubroom.
％Ｂ
「This week...」
I need to get Ousaka interested by the end of this week...
But...
％Ｂ
「I have to try to convince her while I'm waiting for her answer to my confession...」
I know I only have myself to blame for this, but it's definitely going to be kind of difficult...

Well, it's not like I can change her answer. Let's just do my job as an event committee member...!

％Ｂ
「All right... Ousaka!」
...No response.
％Ｂ
「I'm coming in.」
％Ｂ
「...Huh? She's not here?」
Maybe she isn't here yet?
Wait, but the telescope isn't here.
％Ｂ
「I guess she must've carried it up to the roof herself again.」
Even though I've told her to wait for me so I can carry it for her...
％Ｂ
「Maybe... she feels awkward about seeing me?」
I don't really think that'd happen...
But... I guess it wouldn't be out of the question...
％Ｂ
「...I'm starting to get scared of going up to the roof...」
％Ｂ
「...」
I open the steel door and hesitantly look through.
Sora
「...」
_00cutinBS
Ousaka's here alone, like I thought.
She's already set up the telescope.
_00cutinBS
％Ｂ
「All right... Let's go.」
I take deep breaths and approach her.
％Ｂ
「...Yo.」
Sora
「...!」
Ousaka looks shocked when I call out to her.
％Ｂ
「Hm? Something up?」
Sora
「...*shake shake*」
％Ｂ
「You brought the telescope up here by yourself again? You could've just waited for me.」

Sora
「...I waited.」
％Ｂ
「Huh? Really?」
Sora
「...But you didn't come.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah... I had to stop by the committee office for a bit. I had to make my Monday progress report. But I wasn't that late, you know.」

Sora
「...Sorry.」
％Ｂ
「No, you don't really need to apologize. I just figured that thing was heavy for you.」

Sora
「...I thought you weren't coming.」
％Ｂ
「You thought I wasn't coming? Why not?」
Sora
「...Because... I haven't responded.」
％Ｂ
「O-Oh... I wouldn't stop coming just 'cause of something like that.」

So that must be why she looked so surprised when she saw me.
％Ｂ
「The confession's a confession. Work is work. I'll do what I need to do... Though if you want me to leave you alone until you respond, I'll do that.」


Sora
「...*shake shake*」
％Ｂ
「So it's okay if I keep coming?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「Great. I'm glad.」
Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「Hm? Something up?」
Sora
「...You're different.」
％Ｂ
「Huh? ...Me? I'm different?」
Sora
「...Every boy who confessed to me before avoided me after I said no.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah... Probably because it'd feel awkward.」
Sora
「...I thought you'd be the same way
, Ryou

. But you're here just like usual. That's why... you're different.」

％Ｂ
「That's 'cause I haven't been rejected yet.」
Sora
「...So you wouldn't come anymore if I said no?」
％Ｂ
「No, I would.」
Sora
「...???」
％Ｂ
「I might not come if you said you hated me, because I don't want to make things difficult for you, but if you don't then that means I'd still have a chance.」


％Ｂ
「Getting rejected by the girl you like doesn't mean you have to hate her. I wouldn't have said what I said if I could give up that easily.」


Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「So... You know, let me show off at least a little for you. By carrying your telescope for you, for instance.」

Sora
「...Mm, okay.」
Her cheeks go red.
It's an expression she didn't show me when I made my confession.
But that expression's immediately replaced by an apologetic look.

Sora
「...I can't respond yet... I'm sorry.」
％Ｂ
「No, it's fine. It's not like I need a response right away anyway. I'll just think of it as you taking this seriously.」


Sora
「...I can't really organize my feelings... It's hard...」
％Ｂ
「I'm fine with waiting as long as you know I like you.」

Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「...I bet that first love of yours is a big deal for you. But I'm not planning on losing to him even one bit.」

Sora
「...My first love...? What are you talking about?」
She tilts her head at me in puzzlement.
％Ｂ
「Huh? I mean... I thought you had a first love that you couldn't forget, and that's why you always say no to confessions. That's what I heard, at least...」


Sora
「...*shake shake*」
％Ｂ
「...Uhh...」
Wait a second...
I know that's what Segawa told me.
I mean, of course, Segawa herself said it was a rumor...
％Ｂ
「...Is that wrong?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「Nothing to do with your first love?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「So that means... The only reason you've been saying no to all those guys is 'cause you didn't see yourself being with them?」

Sora
「...*nod*」
...Let's summarize real quick.
％Ｂ
「So... The whole first love thing for you is just a misunderstanding on my part?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「...Really... Okay... Haha... hahahahaha...」
I laugh hollowly.
I'm suddenly feeling really tired.
So I've been taking some guy who doesn't even exist and making him out to be my competition...

％Ｂ
「Sigh... The hell am I doing...?」
all
％Ｂ
「Hm...?」
Sora
「...」
A droplet of water falls on my cheek.
Ousaka and I look up. There are heavy-looking clouds looming overhead all of a sudden.

％Ｂ
「...Not good.」
I see a few dark spots appear on the ground. The droplets quickly become larger, and multiply in number.

％Ｂ
「This way, Ousaka!」
Sora
「Gh...」
I pull Ousaka by the hand and run through the rooftop door.
％Ｂ
「Phew... That was close. We got ambushed by a downpour.」
I'm glad we got under cover as soon as it started.
We probably would've gotten completely soaked in an instant otherwise.
Sora
「...Oh!」
Ousaka suddenly tries to run back into the rain.
％Ｂ
「H-Hey, Ousaka!?」
Sora
「...The telescope...!」
％Ｂ
「Oh, crap!」
We left the telescope out!
％Ｂ
「I'll go get it! You stay here!」
I run past Ousaka, out into the rain.
％Ｂ
「Bfhah... It's raining like crazy...!」
％Ｂ
「Whoa!?」
And now there's thunder, too...!
This is terrifying! Lightning's not gonna strike the telescope, right!?
I grab the telescope and run through the pouring rain and rumbling thunder, back to cover.
％Ｂ
「Phew...」
Ousaka pulls a handkerchief out and wipes my face before the telescope.

％Ｂ
「Thanks. But the telescope's more important. It got pretty wet. Is it gonna be okay?」

Sora
「...No issues if we dry it out right away... but you're wetter right now

, Ryou

.」
％Ｂ
「I'm fine. Let's take this to the clubroom.」
Sora
「...Uuh... *nod*」
Ousaka leads the way to the astronomy clubroom. I carry the telescope behind her.
It's a little scary walking through the halls when my feet are soaking wet from the rain.
％Ｂ
「It'd be great if we had a hair dryer or something... Do you have one in the clubroom?」
Sora
「...One of my friends might have one. I'll ask.」
％Ｂ
「Got it.」
all
％Ｂ
「I hope the water didn't get to the lens... We might have to take it apart if it... has... Aah... Aacchoo!」


％Ｂ
「Ughhh... I thought it was cold. I'm soaked down to my underwear...」

It was just ten or twenty seconds of exposure, too...
What a horrific ambush by the rain...
