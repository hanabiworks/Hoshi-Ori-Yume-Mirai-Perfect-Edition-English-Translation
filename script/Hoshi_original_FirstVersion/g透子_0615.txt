「Ahh... Now I'm refreshed!」
$$smh_OpenCHK
I enjoyed playing futsal for the first time in forever over the weekend.
Emptying my mind to play sports has gotten my heart feeling a lot lighter.
Being active seems to get me functioning better in general.
I should come here to exercise every now and then from now on.
Sora
「...What are you doing?」
％Ｂ
「Whoa!? You scared me, Ousaka...! Don't suddenly say stuff from behind me like that.」

Sora
「Got it. I'll take care from now on.」
％Ｂ
「I'm just on the way back from getting some exercise. How about you?」
Sora
「...Shopping?」
％Ｂ
「...What are you asking me for?」
Sora
「...Market investigation? I'm going to the marketplace to buy things I need.」
％Ｂ
「Things you need? ...What are you buying things for?」
Sora
「Stargazing. I'm going to buy summer equipment. There are lots of things I need to prepare for the Tanabata Festival.」

％Ｂ
「You decided what you're gonna do? I've got no plans, so you mind if I come with? Going on your own's gonna be rough, I bet.」

Sora
「...*nod*」
all
Sora
「Thanks for today. You were a big help.」
％Ｂ
「Want me to walk you home? That's a lot of bags.」
Sora
「...This much is fine. I always carry the telescope to the rooftop like this.」

％Ｂ
「Haha, all right. Be careful then.」
Sora
「...Wait. There's something I want to give you.」
％Ｂ
「Hm? What?」
Sora
「Thanks for today. Have it.」
She hands me a small gift bag.
It's been wrapped cutely as a present, with a star-shaped sticker on it.

％Ｂ
「...When'd you buy this?」
Sora
「Bought it at the general store. Open it. I think it's good. I'm sure you'll like it too
, Ryou

.」
％Ｂ
「...Is this a keychain?」
It's star sand. It says "Wish Upon a Star" on the packaging.
...Though the "Clearance: 300 Yen" sticker on it ruins everything.

Sora
「The stars have great power. They can make wishes come true. Making wishes come true for 300 yen. Reasonable.」

％Ｂ
「...Ousaka, you know you shouldn't talk about how much it cost, right? And if you wanna give something as a present, you should get them to take the price tag off...」


Sora
「...? But it was a good value.」
...Whatever. Presents aren't about the price tag.
It's a sign of Ousaka's goodwill. I'll gratefully accept it.
Sora
「Hope your wish comes true.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, same. I'll think of a wish.」
Sora
「Then... see you.」

％Ｂ
「Ahh... Refreshing. Taking a bath always feels great.」
I took a bit of a shower after futsal, but washing away your sweat isn't enough to get the fatigue out of your bones.

I've washed away a day's worth of sweat and fatigue... but the emotions in my heart are still there. I can't wash those away.

％Ｂ
「...」
It's only been two days.
I haven't seen her or heard her voice for just two days... and it feels so unsatisfying.

％Ｂ
「I... like Yukimura.」
I can feel a faint emotion take hold in me as I say it out loud.
My heart feels just the slightest bit lighter.
I want to see her face. I want to talk to her.
I want it to be tomorrow already.
％Ｂ
「I... wonder what she's doing right now.」
If I wanna hear her voice then I should just call her.
If I want it to be more casual, then I can just talk to her over LIME.
％Ｂ
「...Gh.」
But what would I talk to her about if I was going to call her?
What would I tell her if I was going to contact her?
％Ｂ
「I'll have to do something about this... How am I supposed to look her in the eye from now on?」

...I can just think about that tomorrow.
There won't be any issues if I mentally prepare myself by then.
【％Ｂ】「I'll come by tomorrow #Nafter school.」
％Ｂ
「There's... probably no point in waiting for a response.」
She'll probably respond tomorrow, if not tonight.
I guess I'll just go to bed now...
％Ｂ
「...Oh, right. This.」
The small vial on my desk catches my eye.
It's the star sand Ousaka gave me.
％Ｂ
「The stars have great power, she said...」
I don't know what my wish is yet.
I get up from my bed, grab the vial, and think.
％Ｂ
「...I know what my wish is.」
"The stars have great power."
I'll believe Ousaka's words. Let's make a wish.
I walk up to the window, still holding the vial.
I look up at the night sky and say the wish in my heart.
％Ｂ
「...I wish to have courage.」
