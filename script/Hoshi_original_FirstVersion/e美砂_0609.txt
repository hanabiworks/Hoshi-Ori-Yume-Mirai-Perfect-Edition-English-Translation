Shuuichi
「And so, we have received statements from the astronomy and naturalist clubs that they will both be participating in the Tanabata Festival.」

Shuuichi's words are greeted by applause.
all
Misa
「I sincerely apologize for what trouble I have caused you on this matter. Though we may have been delayed, we of the naturalist and astronomy clubs will indeed be participating in the Tanabata Festival.」



Sora
「...Thanks.」
Misa
「Thank you very much for agreeing to help us.」
It's the day after we got back from camping.
Okihara-senpai and Ousaka are going to be a part of the Tanabata Festival.
Okihara-senpai's statement is just as conscientious as we've come to expect from her.
Ousaka's as curt as ever, but I'm sure she feels the same way as Okihara-senpai... probably.

all
Shuuichi
「The event committee is going to support both clubs to the fullest, so that they can both participate in the Tanabata Festival. 

Ryousuke, you 
You 
and Shinozaki are going to be in charge of this.」
％Ｂ
「Roger that. You can count on us.」
Marika
「Okihara-san, Ousaka-san, please let us know if there's anything you need. We'll help you as much as we're able.」

all
Misa
「Thank you very much.」
Sora
「...Thanks.」
Natsuki
「Mhm, mhm! This is what they mean when they talk about solidarity in the face of adversity! Wasn't it a great idea to go camping like I said?」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, it was.」
all
Marika
「Looks like all those super-spicy rice crackers were worth it.」
％Ｂ
「My stomach hurts just remembering them...」
all
But Segawa's right.
I feel like we've all gotten closer from going camping together.
I'm definitely grateful on that front.
all
Shuuichi
「As the event committee chair, I'm relieved to see that all clubs are now participating... but there isn't much time until the actual festival.」

Shuuichi
「Since we're all here anyway, how about we talk about what you might want to do for the festival?」

It's just like he says. We don't have the time to just be happy that they're participating.\n\r

If they're going to participate, then we'll need to make sure they succeed.
all
％Ｂ
「Okihara-senpai, Ousaka, do you two have anything specific that you'd like to do?」

Misa
「Well... It may be a rather large-scale effort, but there is something I've always wanted to do.」

Marika
「What would that be?」
Misa
「A school-building aquarium!」
Misa
「I would like to select themes for each classroom and display relevant fish there. I think it would be very exciting for the guests to be greeted by different fish in every room they visit.」


Misa
「And the gym in particular would have a large-scale tank, with freely swimming whale sharks and manta rays―」

％Ｂ
「I see! That's a wonderful idea!」
Misa
「Isn't it! I'm sure that everyone who saw it would be moved!」
％Ｂ
「But, well, I do feel like it may be just very slightly on the unrealistic side.」

Misa
「Oh... Perhaps it may be too difficult after all?」
％Ｂ
「Yes, just barely.」
Misa
「Oh really... That's quite the shame. So close.」


Shuuichi
「That would not be close at all. It would be impossible even if we scrounged together all of the funds this school has.」

Marika
「U-Umm... What about you, Ousaka-san? Do you have any ideas for something that you'd like to do?」


all
Sora
「...A trip to outer space.」
％Ｂ
「Mmm～ I think we might just barely be able to make that one work...?」
Shuuichi
「As if!」
all
Sora
「...Then stargazing to see the furthest possible heavenly body from Earth.」
Marika
「Wow, that sounds fun!」
Sora
「The current furthest known galaxy from Earth is "MACS0647-JD." It's 31,633,000,000 light years away. It was discovered with the use of the Hubble telescope in 2012―」






all
％Ｂ
「All right! Let's get cracking on making an observatory that rivals the Hubble telescope, then!」
Shuuichi
「Like we'd be able to!」
％Ｂ
「I guess people must exchange their hopes and dreams for calculation ability when they put on glasses...」

Shuuichi
「I have not. Don't stereotype me for wearing glasses.」

all
Marika
「U-Umm～ But... I think... it'd be helpful if it could be something that's possible for us high school students?」


Sora
「...A planetarium, then.」
％Ｂ
「A planetarium? That sounds perfect for the Tanabata Festival.」
Marika
「And Okihara-san, perhaps instead of using all of the classrooms, we could borrow the use of one of the larger classrooms and create a mini aquarium?」


all
Misa
「A mini aquarium! That sounds like a very good idea!」
％Ｂ
「A mini aquarium and a planetarium... I like it. What do you think, Shuuichi?」

all
Shuuichi
「Let's see... The main issues are going to be the specifics and―」

Natsuki
「I think it'll be fine. The main problem's gonna be how much time we've got left. They both sound like they'd take a decent amount of time to pull off.」


Shuuichi
「Hey! ...Why are you the one answering the question!?」
Natsuki
「Because I'm the supervisor.」
Supervisor? ...When was that decided?
all
Shuuichi
「Ahem... Whatever. I agree with Segawa.」

Shuuichi
「There are no issues with the plans themselves, but those sound like they'll take effort to prepare. But unfortunately, we only have a limited number of people.」


％Ｂ
「Yeah, that's true.」
all
I wanna do everything I can for Okihara-senpai and Ousaka now that they've decided to participate.

But we're already strapped for time and manpower. Preparing both a mini aquarium and a planetarium at the same time might be too difficult.


There's also the chance that we'll just end up with two mediocre displays if we don't manage things properly...

％Ｂ
「Hmm...」
Considering who we've got... Shinozaki, Shuuichi, me... and the self-appointed supervisor Segawa... If it's just one of them, then...

％Ｂ
「No! We can't do that!」
Marika
「Hyah!? That surprised me～」

Natsuki
「What are you shouting out of the blue for?」
％Ｂ
「Oh... M-My bad... I just...」
all
％Ｂ
「Anyway, we now know what it is you two would like to do. There wouldn't be any point lamenting our lack of resources at this point, so let's just start by doing what we can!」


％Ｂ
「I'm sure that it'll turn out great! Let's all work together so both projects are a success!」

Misa
「Yes! Thank you very much! We're looking forward to working with you.」

Sora
「...I'll do my best too.」
I may only have known these two for a short while, but I'm pretty sure I know just how passionate they are about their club activities.

And that's why I've gotta think of a good way to do this, so that they both have something they can be satisfied with!

％Ｂ
「Hmm...」
I know I said all that...
But how are we actually gonna make it happen...?
％Ｂ
「Hnmhh...」
Marika
「Hey... What have you been thinking about this whole time?」
Natsuki
「Maybe he's only now thinking about what he needs to do now that he's gone and said something reassuring to everyone?」

Natsuki
「Aquariums and planetariums are both a lot of work. I don't think you can really go halfheartedly on those. And even if you could, there's no point in helping them if it's only going to end up looking bad.」


％Ｂ
「Man... You don't hesitate at all when it comes to saying stuff that makes people uncomfortable.」
Natsuki
「I am the supervisor, you know.」
％Ｂ
「Well, you're right. We could probably just make something that vaguely resembles what they want. But that's not what we wanna do.」


％Ｂ
「We want the people who see their displays to see the stars and the ocean in the same way they do.」

％Ｂ
「But how do we do that... Hmmhhh...」
Natsuki
「You're gonna break your back if you lean back while thinking like that.」
Marika
「Ahaha... He's really deep in thought right now.」
Natsuki
「Well, I want it to succeed too. It'd be better for the grad-album that way. So I need you all to do good work!」


Marika
「You're right. I'll think too, and I'll try asking other people.」
％Ｂ
「Asking others... Getting more opinions...」
There might be a limit to the ideas I could come up with on my own.
Maybe I'll try relying a bit on the people around me.
