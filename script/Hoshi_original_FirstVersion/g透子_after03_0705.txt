Wearing a suit's started to get pretty uncomfortable in this heat.
Touko's gradually gotten used to working as the two of us were both assigned to the same tasks.

"It's easier to take care of both of you at once. Make use of your specialties to complement each other." That was Mr. Azuma's line of reasoning, and so Touko and I have been paired up, with me taking on the role of trainer. 

％Ｂ
「Touko, I'm done with this blueprint. I need you to put the documents together like we discussed in the project proposal.」

Touko
「Okay. The budget's... Agh, it's looking kinda rough right now. We need to keep costs down somehow...」

Touko's more on top of things than usual when she's working.
She comes across as a capable working woman, and she's become well liked by everyone in the firm, as well as our clients.

％Ｂ
「This kinda... reminds me of high school. You know, back when we were both in the event committee.」

Touko
「Ahaha, you're right. I wasn't working seriously at all back then, was I?」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, you'd go right from bothering me to taking a nap... You just did anything and everything you wanted.」

Touko
「...You don't have to say it. It's embarrassing.」
Meetings always go better when I'm there with Touko.
People sometimes ask me, "You're not with Yukimura-san today?" just like they did back when I was running around school for event committee work.

She's good at making people smile through conversation.
Touko's unexpectedly good communication skills apparently only got better through her part-time job at the café.

I was surprised to see this side of her I hadn't been able to before.\n \n\r
Touko's absorbed lots of information over these last few months, and she's grown so much that she hardly seems like the same person she was when she joined in spring.

Touko
「Still... It's really nostalgic. It's been so long since then... Lots of things have changed for us.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, you're right. I never would've imagined we'd be working side by side like this.」

Touko
「Ahaha, me too. My fuzzy view of the future's finally become clearer... I'm having so much fun right now, and it's really fulfilling.」


We smile at each other.
Every day's busy, but we're working together to support each other.

Touko
「I've been thinking a lot lately. About what I might be doing now... if I hadn't met you

, Ryousuke

.」

％Ｂ
「What?」
Touko
「I'd be somewhere else, working some other job... I might've been wandering around still, without being able to find what I wanted to do. Thinking about that makes me... Ahaha, it makes me a bit scared.」


％Ｂ
「Touko...」
Touko
「Oh, sorry... I know we're working right now. I'll put those documents together, so you can eat without me.」

％Ｂ
「...No, I'll wait. I'll help if there's anything I can do, so let me work on it too.」

Touko
「Wha, but... This isn't that much...」
％Ｂ
「It's fine. I should at least act a little like a senior coworker.」

Touko
「...Mm, okay. I think I'll take you up on the offer, then. Thanks, Senpai.」

I know I shouldn't during work, but I feel ticklish.
all
I'm working for Touko's sake, and she's working for mine.
The fact that we're loving and supporting each other like this makes me so happy.
Azuma
「You two have a moment?」
all
％Ｂ
「Oh, yes. What is it?」
Azuma
「I want your opinions on something. I figured you two would be the best to ask for this.」
He lays out some documents on a desk.
This is... the blueprint for that restaurant we were commissioned for last month.
Azuma
「The client apparently wants to be able to hold wedding ceremonies here too, aimed mostly toward young couples. And so I wanted to know your opinions, since you're the youngest ones here.」


％Ｂ
「...That's a hard request.」

Touko
「Mmm... I have things I've imagined and such, but I don't think I'll have much in the way of useful opinion.」

Azuma
「Something along those lines is fine. They apparently want to design it so they'll be able to support a bride and groom's dreams, so a woman's imaginings on the matter would be perfect.」


I can't think of anything at all.
All I think of when I think of weddings are just related terms like "church," "dress," and "reception."

Touko
「Let's see, then... There's this part here that's adjacent to the garden. You might be able to see the neighborhood outside with the windows at this height.」


Azuma
「...So it's not "be seen," but "see." You're talking about seeing the outside from the inside.」

Touko
「Yes. It's good that it's high enough that you can't see the garden from outside, but I think it'd bother many women. They'd probably be worried about how their immersion might be broken mid-ceremony.」


Azuma
「I see what you're saying. Hm... But we don't want to sacrifice the wide-open feel either... I guess I'll try taking a taller and thicker window design into account.」


Touko
「How are you going to handle the lighting and acoustics? With the design, the main table would probably be here, so... You'd at least want extra spotlights along the ceiling and walls, as well as over the entrances.」


Azuma
「We're going to be deciding on all that with the contractors in the future. I'll put your thoughts down as part of our comments on the matter.」

Touko
「And also... this is a restaurant, so the food would be the main selling point. Dessert buffets are becoming more popular lately, so I think increasing the area on this side would lessen the chance of accidents.」


Azuma
「It's supposed to already be pretty big, but you say we need more... I bet it'd be hard for women to walk here with their dresses too, so I guess I'll rethink the lines of motion and the spacings.」


Touko
「Mmm... I think that's about all from me from just looking. I could probably come up with more if I thought about it some more... Do you have anything else?」

％Ｂ
「Huh? Oh, uh... Not really. I think it's fine as a restaurant, but if you want it to be for weddings too... I can't really get a solid image in my mind.」


Azuma
「I see. We have until tomorrow for this, so if you think of something, write it down for me. We'll have a meeting and get everyone's opinions together.」


all
He sets the blueprint aside and returns to his desk.
I'm surprised and kinda lost. I ask Touko the question on my mind.
％Ｂ
「...Touko. When you'd look all that stuff up?」
Touko
「Mm? Oh, I didn't look it up or anything. I've always been like, "If only this were like that!" while reading magazines, and I just ended up remembering all that.」


Touko's had wedding ideas in mind without me even knowing.
I hadn't realized at all, even though we've been living together.
I'm sure it wasn't for studying or work.
She must've been thinking about it... for the sake of her own future.
Marriage is an especially important point in a woman's life.
We've been together for a long time. It might be natural for Touko to have some kind of idealized vision of the future like that in mind.

Touko
「Ahaha, I've become a complete workaholic, haven't I? That kinda stuff's all I look at when I read features now.」

％Ｂ
「You've really gotten into it, yeah. You've started going straight for the floor plan guide whenever we go somewhere lately. You've become a real professional.」


Touko
「Not really, though I do get curious. And that thing with the bridal-plan restaurant was just me saying what came to mind anyway.」


The fact that those thoughts came to mind immediately must be a sign of how much she prioritizes those ideas.

And compared to her, I'm...
％Ｂ
「...All right. It's about time for lunch. Let's eat and do our best in the afternoon too.」
all
Touko
「What's wrong? You've been spacing out... You've been acting kinda weird since lunch today.」

％Ｂ
「Huh? Oh, no... It's nothing.」
I feel surprise and a sense of uselessness.
I've realized that I need to consider my future together with Touko more seriously.

Touko
「You're not sick, are you? Don't force yourself if you're not feeling well, okay?」

％Ｂ
「I'm fine. Sorry for making you worry.」
Touko
「As long as you're feeling okay. You always start working yourself too hard as soon as I take my eyes off of you
, Ryousuke

. I need to be there to make sure you slack off.」

％Ｂ
「Haha, the heck? Mr. Azuma's gonna yell at us if we're slacking off.」
Touko
「That's not true. He slacks off with me a lot.」

...The hell are they doing?
All right. I should hurry up and become more efficient at getting work done.
Touko
「...I can come over there since you're not sick, right? There we go.」
％Ｂ
「Wha, hey...」
She leans against my shoulder.
She's serious during work, but she always starts acting spoiled the moment we get home.
Touko
「It's okay, right? No one's watching. We need to treasure our private time.」

％Ｂ
「Haha, this part of you is never gonna change, huh?」
Touko
「Because it feels sooo good. I can't get rid of how tired I am after a day's work without this.」

％Ｂ
「So then how am I supposed to do that?」
Touko
「Mmm... By spoiling me? You know how people say giving a pet attention soothes you? It's like that.」


％Ｂ
「Pff... Hahahah! Touko, you're pretty much calling yourself a pet, you know.」

Touko
「That's fiiine. I'm going to have you give me looots and lots of attention as your pet, Ryousuke. Meooow♪」

Touko
「That's fiiine. I'm going to have you give me looots and lots of attention as your pet. Meooow♪」

％Ｂ
「Hey, that tickles! Ahahahah!」
There's a sense of "We want to be together forever" that pervades every part of our conversations.
I thought it'd still be a little further in the future... but it might be time for me to start thinking about it seriously, as an actual possibility.

About taking another step forward from our current relationship―
