June 2nd.
I'm meeting up with Rikka on Shionagi's main street after work.
We're going to submit our marriage registration form to city hall, which is right by the marketplace.
We wanted today to be the day we celebrate us entering a new stage in our lives.
％Ｂ
「Thanks for waiting. You've got the form?」
Rikka
「Mhm. Here.」
She pulls out and unfurls the proof that we're to become husband and wife.

All of the fields have been filled out.
We haven't forgotten to put in our own seals, as the people who are actually to be married.

Rikka
「This is going to be the last time I use my seal as a Narusawa, isn't it.」
％Ｂ
「Sad?」
Rikka
「Just a bit. But it's not like my relationship with my parents is going to change because I'm not a Narusawa anymore. I'm more happy than sad. Because I'll be Hino Rikka starting today, hehe.」
Rikka
「Just a bit. But it's not like my relationship with my parents is going to change because I'm not a Narusawa anymore. I'm more happy than sad. Because I'll be ％Ａ Rikka starting today, hehe.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. We're gonna be husband and wife, starting today.」
Rikka
「Ehehe. I'm going to be your wife soon.」
She smiles happily and bashfully.
％Ｂ
「Let's go submit it.」
I stick out my elbow, and Rikka links her arm tightly with mine.
We walk toward city hall...
Enjoying each and every step we take up the stairwell to happiness.
We arrive at the reception window.
Rikka
「Let's submit it together, okay?」
％Ｂ
「Okay. I'll hold the right side, so you hold the left.」
The lady at the window smiles as she watches us.

％Ｂ & Rikka
「Ready, and...」
We submit our marriage registration form.
City Hall Employee
「Congratulations on your marriage.」
％Ｂ & Rikka
「Thank you very much!」
As of today―
We are husband and wife.
Rikka
「Fuaaaahh～ ...afh...」
I wake up earlier than usual.
My mind feels completely refreshed, even though I haven't taken a shower yet.\n\r
I look to my side to see his wonderful face, still comfortably asleep.
Rikka
「I... married him.」
It's slowly starting to feel real, a day after the fact.
I feel an uncontainably large, uplifting sensation inside my chest.
Rikka
「Hnnhhhh～～～～～～♪ Hehehe, ehehehe, eheheeeh... He made me his wiiiife～」

I hug our pillow tight without thinking.
Rikka
「Oh... I'll wake him up if I overdo it... Oh... My phone.」

There's a blinking icon on the screen, telling me I have missed messages.
I navigate to the app to find lots of messages that say "Congratulations."

I open one mail after another.
Rikka
「Natsuki called, too. I'll need to thank her afterward... Hehe, from Marika and Touko too... "You'll be calling him a certain something now that you're married, won't you? Looking forward to the next time I see you..."」
The message spells out what it is.
I've always dreamed of calling him this.
I look at his sleeping face and try it.
Rikka
「D-Dear... ～～～～～～～～～～hgh!! Th-This is...!」
Those four letters prove disastrous for my heart.
Rikka
「D-Dear... ～～～～～～～～～～hgh!!\n...Dear. ～～～～～～～～～～gh!\nDear... ～～～～～～～～～～ghh!!」
Squeeze, squeeze, squeeeeze～～～～～!!
It's so embarrassing. I can't help but squeeze our pillow tight.
It looks like I'll need to practice in secret before he wakes up.
all
Rikka
「Mmm～～～ ...Chu. Wake up, dear♪」
％Ｂ
「Nh, nnhh...」
Rikka
「Geez... It's our first morning as husband and wife, and you're still the same as ever... It's like I'm the only one who's in such a good mood here... Wake up, dear... Chu!」
％Ｂ
「Nh... Oh, morning, Rikka...」
I greet her, but she looks like she's sulking for some reason.
％Ｂ
「Wh-What's wrong...?」
Rikka
「Mmhhh... What do you mean, "What's wrong"... You called me Rikka... even though I called you dear... Stupid...」
％Ｂ
「Wha... Huh, oh...」
Right, now that I think about it, we...
I was completely out of it because I was half asleep, and everything seemed like it was the same as usual.
％Ｂ
「Can I get a do-over?」
Rikka
「Okay... Then could you wake me up next?」
％Ｂ
「Uh... Wake you...?」
all
Rikka
「Okay, I am now asleep. Zzz, zzz.」
She lies down on our bed and closes her eyes before I can get a word in.
I guess she wants me to wake her up, newlywed-style.
She's even audibly snoozing.
Let's see... If she's calling me "dear," then I'll have to call her...
％Ｂ
「Come on, it's morning. Wake up... Ho...Honey... Chu.」
Rikka
「Chu... Hehe, good morning, dear♪ Hehe, it's pretty embarrassing, isn't it?」
％Ｂ
「I can't get used to it. You're always gonna be Rikka to me.」
Rikka
「Hehehe, you're right. It was embarrassing when I called you dear too. But it made me happy. Let's call each other that at least every now and then, okay? Wash up and get changed... Chu.」
all
She kisses me once more and leaves the bedroom.
％Ｂ
「Wow... So Rikka and I are married now.」
I grab the pillow we use together and slap it a bunch out of embarrassment.
％Ｂ
「...? Huh? Why's all the stuffing pushed to one side? What...?」
％Ｂ
「Nh... Nnnghh.」
I'm finally awake after washing my face.
I can hear sounds from the balcony.
Rikka
「I'm sorry! I'll be finished hanging up all the laundry in a bit, so you'll have to wait for breakfast a bit!」
％Ｂ
「I'll get things ready, then!」
I start reheating the pot of miso soup that Rikka made.

Rikka's straightening out my shirts and hanging them from the drying pole with clothespins.

I've seen her do this countless times before, but it all seems so new to me.
Eventually, I hear her slippers flapping along the flooring.
Rikka
「Thank you for getting things ready.」
％Ｂ
「You did most of it already. All I did was reheat it and serve.」
Rikka
「But you've been studying late every night, haven't you? Your second-class architect subject exam is next month, so I don't want to burden you.」
％Ｂ
「It wouldn't be good for me to get too hung up on it. I can relax more by doing housework every now and then.」
Teacher's told me I won't need the second-class architect qualifications if I'm going to end up getting the first-class qualifications anyway.

But he also told me the firm would handle the costs for the exam if I did want to take it...
It was an incredible offer. I can never thank Mr. Azuma enough.
I decided to take him up on the offer and take the exam.
One reason is that I wanted to test my own abilities.
And another is that I'd get an accompanying raise.
Getting a 5,000-yen raise is a pretty big deal for a new hire like me.
Rikka
「When do you think you'll be done with work today?」
％Ｂ
「I don't think we're super busy with any cases today, so I think I can be home by 8 p.m. I'll let you know if it looks like I'll be any later than that.」
Rikka
「Well, I only have a special seminar for the university at around noon today, so I'll have dinner ready around then.」
Rikka's been getting tons of requests for performances ever since her joint performance with the Moscow Philharmonic.
She's completely booked for next year.
She's also been putting her all into little things like giving seminars as a special lecturer at our old university and doing demonstrations at the music shop on the main street.
Almost all of her remaining time is devoted to practice.
She practices an absolutely enormous amount for the sake of just a few hours of actual playing.
I know just how much talent she truly has from living with her.
％Ｂ
「I'm looking forward to dinner. Oh, I'll clean the bath once I get back. Let's get in together.」
Rikka
「Okay! Hehehe.」
all
I suddenly feel like something's off as I walk out the door.
％Ｂ
「Oh... When'd you change this?」
I look at the paper card slotted into the doorplate.
It no longer says "Narusawa," but...
Rikka
「This morning. Because I'm not Narusawa anymore. It'd be strange if it didn't list me as having the same last name as my husband, wouldn't it? Hehe.」
Two first names, side by side, under the last name of ％Ａ.
My name and Rikka's.
I can feel emotion surge up in my chest.
Rikka
「I'm planning on changing the name on my bank account and everything too later today.」
％Ｂ
「Okay, that sounds good.」
％Ｂ
「I'll be going, then.」
Rikka
「Have a nice day... Mmh, chu.」
Our life hasn't changed.
But there's something that definitely has...
...I've married Rikka.
Rikka
「Kyaahh!? Hehe, ahaha, geez, that tickles～ Don't touch me theeere～」

％Ｂ
「I can't wash you if you don't stay still.」
Rikka
「It's because you're touching me in dirty ways. Hehe, ehehe... Ah, geez, you're doing it again～」
％Ｂ
「You just think so. I'm washing you totally normally.」
Rikka
「Mmhh... I don't think so. I'll do what you were doing to me earlier.」

She takes her soapy hands and touches my chest.
She starts massaging me with her fingers.
％Ｂ
「Ahaha, pff...! That tickles! Or more like, it's dirty!」
Rikka
「But this is the same as what you were doing to me earlier. See, now you know for yourself, don't you? Tickle tickle tickle～」
％Ｂ
「Ahahahaha, hahahahahahahah! S-Stop it, ahahahahahah!」
We're washing each other's bodies.
We may not be able to do this every day, but getting to take baths together like this when we both have the time is just another thing we enjoy.
It occasionally unfolds into sex, but even just playing around like this is plenty enough bliss.
％Ｂ
「Gh, why you! I'm gonna get you back! Tickle tickleee!」
Rikka
「Hyan!? Ahahah, hehe, ehehehehe! You're touching me the same way agaaain...! Kyaaah, hehehe, ahahahah!」
％Ｂ
「I'm gonna cover you in suds!」
Rikka
「Two can play this game! Tickle tickle tickleee～ Aha, ehehehehe!」
Our laughter continued to echo in the bathroom for a while after that too.
all
I'm studying for the second-class architect exam after fun time in the bath with Rikka.
％Ｂ
「Phew... Oh, it's already this late...」
I look to see it's past one o'clock.
It wouldn't be good for work tomorrow if I stayed up too late.
％Ｂ
「I'll get to a good cutoff point and end there.」
％Ｂ
「...Hm?」
I feel something on my shoulders. Rikka's hands.
％Ｂ
「You're still awake?」
Rikka
「Your shoulders are rock hard. They're so stiff.」
She gently massages them.
％Ｂ
「Oh, oooh～」
Rikka
「How is it?」
％Ｂ
「It feels good.」
Rikka
「Hehe, I'm glad. Let me know if you want me to do anything specific.」
She rubs and massages my shoulders with a dainty, girly amount of strength.
I feel like my heart might melt, along with my body.
％Ｂ
「I feel like I'm sitting in the lap of luxury, having a grand-prize-winning pianist use her pretty fingers to rub my shoulders.」

Rikka
「Geez, you always flatter me like that... I'm just Rikka when I'm around you. I'm your wife Rikka who loves you so, so, sooo much. Ehehe～ ...Mmh, chu.」
She hugs me lightly from behind and kisses my neck.
I can feel her soft breasts on my back, and smell her comforting smell.
％Ｂ
「Hey, Rikka.」
Rikka
「Mm? What is iiit?」
％Ｂ
「I know things are crazy busy right now, and that we haven't saved up enough money yet, but let's definitely have our wedding ceremony next year. Let's prepare bit by bit for then.」

Rikka
「Mhm... I got to marry you, but I still want everyone to celebrate with us too.」
％Ｂ
「I actually heard from my coworkers that Mr. Azuma's apparently practicing leading the toast. Even though I never would've guessed it from how he's been acting...」
Rikka
「Hehe. Natsuki was asking me over the phone too. "When's the wedding going to be? I'll be ready and waiting to celebrate!" I've gotten lots of congratulations from others too...」
％Ｂ
「We're really blessed, aren't we?」
Rikka
「Mhm, we really are. We'll have to become really happy together, with all these people congratulating us, hehe.」
With this many warm people around us...
We once again know for sure just how blessed we are.
