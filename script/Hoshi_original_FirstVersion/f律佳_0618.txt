Music Teacher
「You will have to retake it.」
％Ｂ
「...Okay...」
I trudge back to my seat.
Segawa's clutching her belly trying to hold in laughter next to me.
Music's an elective class, so there's no assigned seating.
Natsuki
「Kh... Pkh, ffh, pffhahahaha! ...You were a real ear-splitter of a singer up there. You're a unique treasure, in a way.」

％Ｂ
「Khh! This is why I didn't wanna do music! I wanted to do art!」

You're allowed to pick from art, music, or calligraphy for an elective here.

And Segawa half invited, half forced me to take music.
Natsuki
「Man, I've really been appreciating that sonic cannon of a voice you've got, ever since we went out for karaoke that one time. How'd you ever get through music classes until now?」


％Ｂ
「It was fine as long as I was in class, 'cause we didn't have tests.」

I can't believe the music class here has a practical exam...
You can pick from either vocal or instrumental tests for the music classes here.
It doesn't matter if it's solo or duet, all you have to do is demonstrate your ability before the teacher and pass.

But if you do a duet, then either of you failing means you both have to retake the exam.

Natsuki
「Look, Rikka's next. Though I bet she's just gonna ace it on piano.」

％Ｂ
「I'm so jealous of people with musical talent...」
all
Music Teacher
「Will you be playing piano, Narusawa-san?」
Rikka
「No. I would like to sing.」
Natsuki
「That's kind of a surprise... I thought she'd play the piano for sure.」
％Ｂ
「Same. Though I guess it doesn't matter either way to her, since she's good at singing too.」
all
Everyone goes silent when Narusawa starts singing along to the teacher's accompaniment. It's like time's stopped.

Narusawa's voice is just as clear and pretty as it was when I heard it at karaoke.

I trudge through the hallway after class ends.
There are three people including me who have to retake the exam.
And I'm pretty sure I'm the worst off among them.
Maybe I should switch to an instrument while I still can?
But I can't play anything other than the recorder or the triangle.
And it's not like I'm good at them. I've just played them before.
Even more so for the melodica.
...It's the end of the line for me.
％Ｂ
「What am I gonna do if I fail the retake too...」
Natsuki
「Don't worry about it! I've never even heard of anyone failing music before! I'm sure they'll just make it so you pass somehow!」

％Ｂ
「Haha, ha...」
Segawa's encouragement doesn't do much other than twist the knife in my heart further.
all
But time won't wait for me.
I can't just stay depressed forever.
I have to do something about this!
％Ｂ
「Teacher! No, Master!」
Rikka
「...Did you forget something again?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, I guess you could say something like that. I must've dropped my musical sense in my mother's belly and forgot to pick it up.」

Rikka
「What are you looking so smug for? ...I didn't ask you to be witty. This is about music class, then?」

％Ｂ
「Be honest. How was I?」
Rikka
「Not good. You really must have left your musical sense in your mother's belly.」

％Ｂ
「I never asked you to use my own wit against me!」
Rikka
「You're the one who started it. So what, then?」
％Ｂ
「I beg you! Please teach me music!!」
I clap my hands together as if in prayer.
Music? Narusawa. Narusawa? Music.
Narusawa's the only option I can think of.
％Ｂ
「Your singing was amazing for your test! You're the only one for me, Narusawa!」

Rikka
「...! Don't shout strange things in public like that!」
Rikka
「Honestly now... Fine. Come to the music classroom during lunch break.」
％Ｂ
「You mean...!」
Rikka
「Yes, I'll teach you. But I won't make any guarantees that you'll pass, okay?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, that's fine! Thank you very much!」
all
Lunch break.
My private music lesson with Narusawa begins after she and I eat lunch in the music classroom.

Rikka
「Your issue is more fundamental than rhythm and so on. Your pitch is off.」
％Ｂ
「What's that mean?」
Rikka
「It means you're tone-deaf, pure and simple.」
％Ｂ
「...Those words hurt more than I expected. But I'm fine. I'll just take that to mean that there's room for improvement.」

Rikka
「So first, we're going to start by getting you to be aware of what notes you're actually singing.」

Rikka
「I'll play solfège on the piano, and you'll try singing the same thing after I play it. There shouldn't be any set of notes more familiar for you.」

She lightly taps the notes on the piano.
It's an extremely ordinary "do, re, mi, fa, sol, la, ti, do."
％Ｂ
「I should be able to do this much.」
Rikka
「...I hope so.」
all
She assumes a relaxed posture and plays.
％Ｂ
「Do, reh. Miii, fuh, tso, lah～, tee, doooh.」
Rikka
「You fail.」
％Ｂ
「I thought that was pretty good!」
Rikka
「That's why I'm saying you're tone-deaf. You'd notice just how off you are if we recorded your voice.」


all
I'm gonna try recording it on my phone.
％Ｂ
「Do, reh. Miii, fuh, tso, lah～, tee, doooh.」
I play it back.
『Do, reh. Miii, fuh, tso, lah～, tee, doooh.』
％Ｂ
「I am so sorry. You were exactly correct, Narusawa-sensei.」
I didn't know I was this off.
I wanna go around and beg everyone who's had to listen to me sing at karaoke for forgiveness.

Rikka
「Your perception of your own voice is a mixture of air conduction and bone conduction. That's why your voice always sounds different when it's recorded, because it's a recording of just the air conduction.」

Rikka
「Though there's also the possibility that you've been deluding yourself about the truth in order to avoid the pain of facing the harshness of reality.」
％Ｂ
「That's a terrible way of saying it, but I can't really deny it...」
％Ｂ
「The only instruments I can play are the recorder and the triangle, so...」

Rikka
「Oh, but you have one more.」
％Ｂ
「Huh?」
Rikka
「It's one that everyone has. Vocal cords are an instrument that every human being has since the day they're born. They're your most familiar musical instrument.」


％Ｂ
「The vocal cords... The mouth as a musical instrument. I get it. I never thought of it that way.」
％Ｂ
「Wait... Then if I can't even use that well...? ...I am ashamed of myself.」
Rikka
「You should use your mouth to practice, not to apologize.」
％Ｂ
「You're right. Let's keep going, please.」
all
％Ｂ
「―And they come up to the surface opening and closing their mouths when you feed them.」
％Ｂ
「Fish are pretty cute. Maybe I should try keeping a few at home.」
I fed the fish and did maintenance on the tanks after school.

Taking care of the fish gets you emotionally invested in them.
Being alone's nice sometimes, but it's pretty lonely. It's something I've only realized after living alone for a while.

Rikka
「You should think about it a little more. Keeping a pet means that you're going to take responsibility for an animal's life.」


％Ｂ
「Yeah, you're right. I wouldn't be fair to the animals if I bought them on an impulse. I'll think it over a little more.」

Rikka
「...By the way, why are we going home together again?」
％Ｂ
「You don't like going home with me?」
Rikka
「It's not that I don't like it... I just noticed we've been going home together a lot lately... Are you sure it's okay for you to keep doing that with me?」


％Ｂ
「Hm?」
Rikka
「You have other friends who stay after school, don't you?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, I do. But it's more fun to go home with you.」
Though I'm not saying it's not fun to take my time and wander my way home with Shuuichi and the other guys.

％Ｂ
「Speaking of which, you ever go places on your way home or anything?」
Rikka
「I go grocery shopping.」
％Ｂ
「No, I meant like hanging out with friends.」
Rikka
「Can't say I have.」
％Ｂ
「Not once?」
Rikka
「No.」
I remember she said she's never played at a playground before too.
So she's never gone out to eat or go shopping with friends either...
％Ｂ
「You wanna go to the marketplace real quick?」
Rikka
「What? ...Right now?」
％Ｂ
「You got plans?」
Rikka
「I don't, but...」
％Ｂ
「All right then! Let's go!」
I grab her hand and start running.
Rikka
「Ah... Wait a second! I never said I'd come with...!」
％Ｂ
「Then... Would you like to have fun together with me?」
Rikka
「...I don't mind going.」
％Ｂ
「All right then, now it's for sure. No doubts, no delays! Let's go, Narusawa!」
Rikka
「Geez, don't pull my hand...! I'll keep up, it's fine!」

％Ｂ
「Nooow then. If you're gonna head somewhere on the way home, eating out's a staple.」

Rikka
「...」
％Ｂ
「You got anything you wanna eat, Narusawa?」
Rikka
「...」
She doesn't say anything.
Guess that makes sense.
Not like she's ever done this before, so she wouldn't know what her options are.
％Ｂ
「I'm pretty sure there's a crêpe place over there. Let's go there.」

I start walking, and then I feel something pull me back a bit from behind.
Rikka
「...My hand. I can walk by myself...」
％Ｂ
「Oh, s-sorry!」
Right! I totally forgot to let go of her hand!
So that's why Narusawa's been so quiet!
Aaaaghh! I grabbed her hand earlier in the heat of the moment, and now I'm suddenly crazy embarrassed!

Rikka
「It's fine... It's not like I hated it...」
％Ｂ
「O-Oh, okay...」
The two of us freeze up in the middle of the street.

The other shoppers dodge around us as they walk past.
Let's just start moving.
％Ｂ
「Let's go eat some crêpes. I've never had them before though, so it'll be a first for me.」

Rikka
「O-Okay...」
I start walking, and Narusawa follows.
all
We buy two crêpes and sit down on a nearby bench.
Mine's a typical chocolate banana crêpe, and Narusawa's is strawberry caramel cheesecake.
There's apparently a cheesecake bar wedged inside of it.
She stares at her crêpe a little apprehensively.
Rikka
「...Time to eat... Amh... hamh, hamh...」
She takes small bites out of her crêpe.
Rikka
「Oh... This is good...」
％Ｂ
「I'm glad. Makes it worth asking you to come with.」
％Ｂ
「So you like cheesecake, then?」
She looks so happy as she eats.
I remember she bought cheesecake back when we saw her at the supermarket before too.
Rikka
「...!」
She gives a start at my pointed question.
Rikka
「...」
She must be really embarrassed about showing her happiness so openly.
She turns red before my eyes.
Uh... This is kinda starting to make me feel embarrassed too...
％Ｂ
「Oh... Uh, I think it's girly and nice. And besides, it's not like I don't eat cheesecake.」

Rikka
「Right... Amh... Amh, amh... Hehe.」
％Ｂ
「...」
I can't stop watching her smile.
Getting to see this smile makes me really glad I asked her to come with me.
Time really does fly when you're having fun.
I've already walked Narusawa all the way to her apartment complex.
Rikka
「See you again.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. Be careful.」
Rikka
「The front door's right there. I don't think there could possibly be anything left to be careful of.」
％Ｂ
「Haha, that's true. See you tomorrow, then.」
all
Narusawa takes one, two steps back as she looks at me.

And then...
She casually looks up at the stars.
She looks down and to her right.
And she turns a bashful smile toward me.
Rikka
「Today... was fun. It was really fun. Thank you.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, same for me. I had a ton of fun.」
Rikka
「Oh... and... Thank you for always walking me back. Could you... walk me back again when it gets dark next time?」

％Ｂ
「Wha...」
％Ｂ
「Y-Yeah! Of course!」
I raise my voice in response.
Rikka
「Hehe. Good night.」
all
I can't get my body to move until after Narusawa turns and walks through the door.

I bet I must've looked absolutely pathetic to Narusawa at the end there.
I can tell I'm still not composed at all.
％Ｂ
「...It's a bit hot today. I think I'll walk home.」
―Early summer.
It's really started to feel like that time of year.
I start on the long walk home, to cool off my flushed body with the cool nighttime breeze.
