The first semester ends today.
The closing ceremony takes no time at all. A boring talk from the principal in the gym, a warning about things to watch out for during summer break from the extracurricular adviser, and done.
But it's not like I get to just go out and play now.
The biggest event of the area, the Tanabata Festival, is going to be for three days starting on August 6th. The school's festival is going to be on the same day, so lots of people are going to be working on preparations at school.
I'm one of those people too.
And there's one more thing.
...The moment that decides my fate for the second semester is about to happen.

Homeroom Teacher
「I've made a lottery for the seat change, so all of you pull from it in order.」

The students at the front of each column did rock-paper-scissors, and we're going to pull from the lottery in the order of who won.

My column's dead last. And I'm second to last in my column on top of that.
Maybe I should believe in finding fortune in leftovers...
Either way, all I can do is pray that the seats next to Rikka don't get taken.
It's Segawa's turn.
She gets the seat next to my current seat―opposite from where Rikka is.
Natsuki
「It's an okay seat for photography.」
all
She nods in satisfaction and sits down in her new seat.
We continue on. More and more seats get taken, and people move across the classroom.
Rikka's turn eventually arrives.
The seat change is almost over at this point. There are only two open seats that are adjacent to each other.
I won't even get to have a chance if Rikka doesn't get one of those seats first.

Rikka
「...」
Rikka must realize that too.
I can see a bit of nervousness in her usually composed expression.
Rikka
「...!」
She closes her eyes in prayer, and puts her hand in the lottery box.
The number on the piece of paper is...
all
Rikka
「Hehe...♪ Ehehe...♪」
Mhm. She looks very satisfied indeed.
She somehow managed to pull the lot for my old seat.
Rikka
「...」
She looks uneasy for some reason.
I don't think anyone around her's noticed, but she's clearly acting strangely.
She's glancing around warily.
Rikka
「...*nod*」
She clears her throat, as if steeling herself.
Rikka
「Ehehe...♪」
She's started gently stroking the surface of my desk!
She looks like she's in bliss.
Hm. I guess I can understand. I might do the same thing if I were sitting at her desk.
She eventually stops, apparently having gotten her fill of petting my desk.
Rikka
「...」
And then she looks around again.
She smoothly leans forward.
Slowly... Slowly... So no one notices.
She lays herself face down on my desk as if it were the most boring thing in the world.
％Ｂ
「Hm?」
Rikka
「Eheheeeh... Hehehehehe...♪」
Rub rub... Rub rub...
Now that I'm looking closely, she's rubbing her cheek on my desk!!
Her expression looks like it's melting with happiness.
Rikka
「...!」
She gasps and sits up, as if she's only just now come to her senses.
Rikka
「...」
She looks around again.
Rikka
「Phew...」
She sighs in relief when she sees that no one saw her.
She nonchalantly turns back toward the chalkboard.
all
Though I saw everything.
Rikka seems cool and mature, but she actually loves to be spoiled.
And she only lets me see her like that, and she only acts that way toward me.
I know all too well that Rikka loves me.
...I'm going on and on about this, I know. But I won't deny it, because it'd be a disservice to Rikka's feelings if I did.

If she loves me that much, then I think I'd be fine being stupidly in love too.
Homeroom Teacher
「Heeey! It's your turn, Hino! Hurry up and draw!」
Homeroom Teacher
「Heeey! It's your turn! Hurry up and draw!」
％Ｂ
「Oh, yes!」
I come to my senses with a start. It's just me and the guy behind me.
And what's incredibly fortunate is that the seat next to Rikka's―that is, Rikka's previous seat―is still open.

My odds are 1 in 2.
―That's when I know.
Haha. This must all be preordained.
Heaven has led the way.
There's no way it's a coincidence for that seat to still be empty.
It's my fate to sit next to Rikka again!
Male Classmate D
「What are you sitting there grinning for? Could you go and draw already?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah... Glory will be mine.」
Male Classmate D
「Wha?」
Rikka
「...Good luck.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. Here goes.」
Rikka's encouragement only bolsters my confidence.
She's a goddess.
all
I walk straight down the road to victory and shove my hand into the box of fate and fortune.
I can feel two folded sheets of paper inside.
My instinct tells me that the right one is the path to glory.
But there's still a chance.
Maybe this is a cruel trick of the gods? Maybe I should do the opposite instead?

The right!
You'd think right, but it's actually left!
％Ｂ
「Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeessss!!」
I scream in exultation. I pump both my fists.
I've pulled the lot for Rikka's previous seat.
Homeroom Teacher
「Uh... Hino. It's fine that you're so happy, but what are you so happy for?」
Homeroom Teacher
「Uh... It's fine that you're so happy, but what are you so happy for?」
％Ｂ
「Wha... Oh, uh... The seat. I like window seats. Getting to be in the sunlight's great, isn't it?」

Homeroom Teacher
「The sunlight, eh? I think it's only going to be hot this time of year, though.」
Natsuki
「He's an idiot, isn't he?」

Rikka
「Hehe, he is. But I'm glad...」
Natsuki
「You're just sooo happy, aren't you～」
Rikka
「Auh... I can't help it. I really am glad.」

Natsuki
「It'd be nice if you could be happy that I'm next to you now too.」
Rikka
「I'm happy about that too, of course. I hope we get along, Segawa-san.」
Natsuki
「Likewise. Now I can take as many close-up photos of you as I want.」
Rikka
「Don't do that.」
all
I swagger over to the seat that I've claimed for myself.
％Ｂ
「Looks like we're next to each other again.」
Rikka
「Mhm.」
％Ｂ
「And Segawa's close too. Let's get along.」

Natsuki
「Yeah, let's. Oh, and don't mind me. Feel free to act as lovey-dovey as you want.」

Natsuki
「I'll take tons of photos for the wedding reception video.」

Rikka
「W-Wedding reception...?」
％Ｂ
「How far ahead are you thinking...?」
All in all, I'm just glad I get to be next to Rikka again.
％Ｂ
「Aaaaaaaghhh!?」
The odds were 1 in 2, and I picked wrong.
Who the hell said this was preordained!?
Right, it was me!!
Rikka
「...」
％Ｂ
「Kh...」
The most painful thing is seeing Rikka's disappointed face.
all
I wonder when the next time we'll change seats is.
At the end of the second semester?
So that means I'll be separated from Rikka for the rest of the year?
Natsuki
「You've got to be kidding me.」
％Ｂ
「Shut up! I know!」
Natsuki
「Sigh... Honestly. You're hopeless. After I got to be next to Rikka too. You owe me one.」

She sighs and raises her hand.
Natsuki
「Sensei. I'd like to trade seats with Hino-kun.」
Natsuki
「Sensei. I'd like to trade seats with him.」
Homeroom Teacher
「Hm? But you don't have bad eyesight, Segawa.」
Natsuki
「I think that seat might be better for taking photos～ It's for the sake of taking excellent photos, as a member of the grad-alb committee.」

all
Homeroom Teacher
「That's fine, then. Hino, will you trade seats with her?」
Homeroom Teacher
「That's fine, then. Will you trade seats with her?」
％Ｂ
「Yes!」
％Ｂ
「Thanks, Segawa.」
Natsuki
「Fufufu! You better think about what you'll do to repay me.」
all
She cackles and changes her seat.
all
Rikka
「I hope we'll continue to get along.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, let's.」
all
Shuuichi
「―Things will only get busier now that summer break's begun! There's always at least one person who keels over every year!」

Shuuichi
「I'm very grateful for your hard work, but please keep your own health in mind!」
Shuuichi's giving words of encouragement for the Tanabata Festival preparations.

Shuuichi
「Anyway, serious talk aside. Is anyone free the day after tomorrow? I was thinking we could go to the beach to recharge. Participation will not be mandatory.」

％Ｂ
「That's sudden.」
Shuuichi
「Because I only just thought of it.」
％Ｂ
「I worry sometimes if you should really be committee chair...」
Shuuichi
「You think of something, you put it to action.」
I think that assertiveness might be the only committee chair-like thing about him.

all
Only a few people raise their hands.
It's hard to get people to do something like that on such short notice.
Rikka, Segawa, Shinozaki, and I raise our hands too.
Shuuichi tells us the time and place to meet up.
％Ｂ
「Oh, I know. Shuuichi. You mind if Okihara-senpai and the others come along too?」
Shuuichi
「Yeah, ask them. The more the merrier.」
all
Misa
「Yes! I would love to attend!」

Sora
「No issues with me.」
all
Touko
「Hey. Am I allowed to come too?」
％Ｂ
「Of course.」
Touko
「Maybe I'll go then.」

Marika
「We'll all get to have fun together this way.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah.」
all
I'm glad all of us seem to be free.
We'll be finished with the ocean half of our display today, so this should be a perfect way to take a break before we start on the star half.

Sora
「Ryou. I have a suggestion.」
Sora
「I have a suggestion.」
％Ｂ
「What is it?」
Not every day Ousaka makes a suggestion.
Sora
「I want to do a stargazing party.」

Touko
「We were all just talking about it before you came.」
all
Misa
「Sora-san is the only one among us who has a solid grasp of constellations and heavenly bodies, isn't she?」

Misa
「Sora-san may be the expert among us, but perhaps we should also have at least a certain degree of knowledge?」

％Ｂ
「I see. A stargazing party? That sounds good.」
all
％Ｂ
「But if we're gonna start the work next week, then tomorrow's pretty much the only day we could do it...」

Sora
「I'm free.」

Touko
「I don't really have anything to do either. I was planning on maybe just wandering around and that's about it.」

Misa
「I also have time.」
％Ｂ
「Let's do it tomorrow night, then.」
Misa
「Wha...? Are you sure it's okay for us to decide on it just like that?」

％Ｂ
「Yes, since I don't have any plans or anything.」
Touko
「Is this... Maybe, it's just a maybe, but...」
Sora
「...Did you and Ritsu have a fight?」
％Ｂ
「Wha... Huh? A fight?」
Why is that the conclusion here?
Misa
「Are you not going on a date with Rikka-san? I have heard that lovers enjoy their day out together on days off.」

％Ｂ
「Well yes, we do go on dates, but we don't go on dates every time we have a day off.」
Sora
「...You're in a rut... Do you want to talk about it?」
％Ｂ
「No, no. It's not something that you guys need to be worried about!」
Marika
「Y-Yeah, that's right! He always gets along great with Narusawa-san!」

all
Marika
「I saw them feeding each other lunch the other day in the music classroom! Narusawa-san ate a clump of rice off his cheek!」
Sora
「...Passionate.」
％Ｂ
「Thank you very much for the support... but don't tell Rikka you saw that.」

...She'd probably want to run away somewhere far if she found out someone we knew saw that.

all
Touko
「Oh, it's Piano-chan.」
all
Yukimura points out the window, down toward the grounds.
_00cutinBS
A few female students including Rikka are walking and talking with some men in suits and construction uniforms.
Ah... Those must be the people for the outdoor concert.
I remember they said at the committee meeting that there's a final meeting and look-over for the Shio-cademy Fest stage today.

Rikka's working hard, isn't she?
And what's most significant is her expression.
I can't tell what she's talking about from here... but she's smiling as she talks to the other committee members.

She's become able to smile like that in front of people other than us... I'm so happy.

_00cutinBS
Misa
「Ufufu. It appears there was no need for us to be worried.」

Sora
「...*nod* You can tell from Ryou's face.」
Sora
「...*nod* You can tell from his face.」
all
％Ｂ
「Let's do our best today too, everyone!」
Marika
「Okay!」
all
We continue on with our work on the display...
And we finish the ocean half of the display by the time we have to go home, just like planned.
