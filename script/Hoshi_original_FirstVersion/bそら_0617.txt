I've come to the courtyard to digest after having lunch in the cafeteria.
％Ｂ
「Mmm... The weather's great today.」
We'll probably be able to stargaze like usual after school today.
％Ｂ
「...Hm?」
There are four girls eating lunch on the grass.
％Ｂ
「Hmmmh!?」
I realize after closer inspection that one of them is Ousaka.
％Ｂ
「No way...」
When I think of Ousaka, I think of her looking through the telescope on the roof by herself, or reading a book alone while eating yakisoba bread... Always alone.


％Ｂ
「I didn't know... she had friends...」
Wait, I'm being really rude here...
Sora
「...Hamh... mgmgh...」
Ousaka's eating some bread that she probably bought at the school store, as expressionless as ever.

But when one of the other girls talks to her, she responds.
The girls smile and sigh every time.
Ousaka's expression doesn't change much, but... I kinda get the impression she might be having fun.

all
Sora
「...」
Ousaka looks at me while I'm staring at her.
％Ｂ
「Oh...」
Sora
「...Oh...」
Looks like she's noticed me.
％Ｂ
「...Uhh...」
Sora
「...」
It's not like I saw something I shouldn't, but her staring at me like that's making me nervous...

all
First-Year Girl A
「Hey... Who's that?」
First-Year Girl B
「He's just staring at us...」
First-Year Girl C
「What should we do? Should we call for a teacher?」
Wait, what? Do I look that dangerous?
Sora
「...
Ryou
Mm
.」
％Ｂ
「Uh...」
Ousaka gestures me over.
I guess she wants me to come to her.
I'm a little hesitant to walk over to a group of underclassmen girls, but it'd be kinda cold of me not to at this point.

％Ｂ
「Y-Yo, Ousaka. I don't see you eating lunch with others too often.」

I walk up to her, trying to sound as cheery as possible.
all
First-Year Girl A
「We eat together a lot, though.」
％Ｂ
「Really? She was just eating bread by herself before...」
First-Year Girl A
「That was when Sora-chan was reading one of her books about stars, right?」
First-Year Girl B
「It's one of our rules that we don't bother Sora-chan when she's reading her books.」

First-Year Girl C
「You didn't bother her, did you?」
％Ｂ
「Bother her...?」
No one ever told me about any rules!
Sora
「...No issues. He didn't bother me.」
Ousaka saves me as I'm wondering how I should respond.
First-Year Girl A
「You're sooo nice, Sora-chan!」
First-Year Girl B
「You're covering for hiiim!」
First-Year Girl C
「Awww, you're soooo cute!」
The three of them hug her tight.
Sora
「...」
Her expression's the same as ever while she's being manhandled.
Is Ousaka pretty popular among her classmates...?\n\r
Though this seems more like they're treating her like a mascot or something.
all
The girls manhandling Ousaka look back at me, as if they had just remembered I was here.

First-Year Girl A
「...Who is this person?」
First-Year Girl B
「Do you know this person, Sora-chan?」
％Ｂ
「Uhh... I'm a second year in the event committee.
 My name's Hino.

」
First-Year Girl A
「Oh, you're an upperclassman.」
First-Year Girl B
「What does the event committee want with Sora-chan?」
％Ｂ
「Uhh, Ousaka and I are, well... friends? Or more like... acquaintances...?」
Neither of those really seems to fit.
How do I explain this?
First-Year Girl C
「He's so suspicious... Let's call for a teacher!」
％Ｂ
「Wait a sec...!?」
Ousaka stands up while I'm freaking out and walks up to me.

Sora
「...No issues.
 This is Ryou.

」
She introduces me to her friends.
Sora
「...
Ryou's
He's
...」
Sora
「...」
Sora
「...
Ryou
Who he is
?」
The heck does that mean...?
％Ｂ
「Uh... I mean, I guess you're not wrong...」
Why did she say it like it was a question?
all
First-Year Girl A
「Hmm, well, I guess as long as you say there's no issue.」

First-Year Girl B
「I guess we can at least say that you know Sora-chan.」

First-Year Girl C
「We won't call a teacher on you, Senpai.」
％Ｂ
「Th-Thank you very much...」
Why do I have to thank them...?
As long as the misunderstanding's been resolved, I guess...
First-Year Girl A
「You said you were Sora-chan's friend, but how'd you get to know her, Senpai?」

％Ｂ
「Uh, me? Uhh... Well...」
I explain to them that I recently transferred into this school, and just happened to meet Ousaka when I came here before starting school.

％Ｂ
「And that's when we promised that she would teach me about the stars again sometime. Right?」

Sora
「...*nod*」
all
First-Year Girl B
「Really, so that means it hasn't even been a month since you met Sora-chan.」

First-Year Girl C
「It's only been a month, but... You know? You seem weeeirdly close with Sora-chan after less than a month.」

％Ｂ
「I'm in charge of the astronomy club as an event committee member. So I do a lot of stuff together with her.」

First-Year Girl A
「Are you sure you aren't just saying you're doing event committee work because you want to be together with Sora-chan?」

Uuuurkh!?
First-Year Girl B
「Oh, it kiiinda seems that waaay.」
％Ｂ
「O-Oh no... Whatever might you girls be talking about...?」
First-Year Girl C
「Whaaat～? Are you after Sora-chan～?」
％Ｂ
「A-After...!? Gasp!」
Crap.
I've just realized that these girls are like kids with a new toy.
They stare at me with entertained-looking grins.
There aren't any girls like this around me, so I don't know how to deal with them...!

First-Year Girl A
「So? So? How is it for you, Sora-chan?」
First-Year Girl B
「Do you have a good thing going on with this person?」
First-Year Girl C
「No waaay～ You two aren't already dating, are you～?」
Sora
「...
Ryou's
He's
...」
Sora
「...」
She stares right at my face and thinks a little.
Sora
「...
Ryou
Who he is
?」
％Ｂ
「I mean... Yeah, again, I am, but...」
First-Year Girl A
「Hmm, doesn't look like iiit.」
First-Year Girl B
「Well, it is Sora-chan we're talking about. It might be a little too early for her.」
First-Year Girl C
「Though that's what makes her so cute～」
The three of them hug Ousaka again.
She's pretty much a pet to them...
％Ｂ
「...Are you all Ousaka's classmates?」
all
First-Year Girl A
「That's riiight.」
First-Year Girl B
「Sora-chan's stories about stars are lots of fun, so we're with her a lot.」

％Ｂ
「Oh yeah, I feel the same way. She knows a ton about that kinda stuff.」

First-Year Girl A
「And she knows a lot about horoscopes too!」
First-Year Girl C
「Yeah, she does. Sora-chan's horoscopes come true a lot～」

％Ｂ
「Wha... You can do horoscopes too? Wow.」
Sora
「...Mhmh.」
She smugly gives me a thumbs-up.
Sora
「...I check on my phone every morning.」
％Ｂ
「You just look off of a website!? And you guys are okay with that?」

all
First-Year Girl B
「But the ones Sora-chan picks out come true!」
First-Year Girl A
「Right? It really rains when she says it'll rain.」
Isn't that just a weather forecast...?
Though I guess I shouldn't say anything too unnecessary.
It just means that Ousaka has their absolute trust for anything related to stars and astronomy.

Still though, I never knew Ousaka had friends.
I was a little worried because I had the impression she was always alone watching the stars, but now I'm relieved.

Sora
「...?」
...I guess I sound like I'm her parent or something.
First-Year Girl A
「So? So? Are you actually after Sora-chan, Senpai?」

First-Year Girl B
「We can help you, you knooow.」
First-Year Girl C
「We'll have to investigate whether you're worthy of Sora-chan first, though～」
％Ｂ
「Uh... Please don't...」
Ousaka's friends are just as energetic as she is quiet...
