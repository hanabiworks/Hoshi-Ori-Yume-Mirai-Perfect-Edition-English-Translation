Oono
「It really is a great house.」
Oono-san's eyes are a little watery as he looks at the completed "house that captures light."\n\r

I feel like I might cry too watching him.
％Ｂ
「I apologize for the construction taking longer than expected.」
Oono's Wife
「Oh no, it's because we made those unreasonable demands. I don't know how to even begin thanking you for building such a wonderful and impressive house...」


I can tell just by looking at Oono-san's wife that her words aren't just out of politeness.\n\r

She's genuinely moved.
％Ｂ
「We're also very proud that it came out to be a wonderful house.」
We wouldn't allow ourselves to give the house over to the client who paid so much money otherwise.\n\r

I'm genuinely proud of this house.
Oono's Wife
「Everyone in our family's happy with it. It seems like it'll be a lot more convenient to live in than expected, now that we've been inside, and it really is bright everywhere inside.」


Oono
「And our son's even boasting about the house to other people. You'd think he built it himself from the way he talks about it.」

％Ｂ
「Speaking of your son and his wife... How is your grandchild?」

Oono's Wife
「Oh, she's just so adorable. I feel like I've gotten younger just from having her around.」

Oono
「I'm glad we were able to have that room built at the last moment. Now I get to see that cute face every day.」

The two of them look so happy.
And I'm happy too, knowing that this house is supporting a happy family and their lives.

％Ｂ
「I was actually planning on having my wife come too, but...」
Oono's Wife
「She's expecting this month, isn't she? She shouldn't overexert herself.」
I guess that goes to show how long we've known each other at this point.
They're fully aware of our circumstances.
Oono
「When is she due?」
％Ｂ
「Actually, it wouldn't be strange for it to be any day now. We're already past the original date...」

Oono
「Is that so? You must be on pins and needles just waiting, then.」

％Ｂ
「Yes, but it isn't anything I have any control over. I've been worried this whole time, but women are very strong in times like these.」


％Ｂ
「She said to me, "It's easier to bear a child than to worry about it"... She's just completely relaxed.」

Oono
「Oh my. That's very strong of her, for her first child.」
％Ｂ
「Well, my mother-in-law comes over when I'm not home, so I'll know right away if anything...」

And then my phone rings at that very moment. Oono-san and I look at each other on reflex.

I look at my phone. It's from that very mother-in-law.
Oono
「Y-You should answer!」
％Ｂ
「Y-Yes, you're right... Hello!?」
I answer the phone with trepidation.
Yumi
『Oh, Ryousuke-kun? Marika's gone into labor.』
Yumi
『Hello? Marika's gone into labor.』
％Ｂ
「R-Really?」
It's just like I thought.
Yumi
『We're about to head to the hospital right now. I don't think she'll give birth immediately, but you should come as quickly as you can.』

％Ｂ
「I-I understand! I'll go right away!」
My voice shakes.
Oono-san looks frantic too. He must've realized from watching me.

Oono
「Has she... Has she perhaps given birth?」
％Ｂ
「Oh, no, she's apparently gone into labor.」
Oono
「Ohh, it's finally time, then. Then please, go to her. I'm sure your wife would welcome the support.」


％Ｂ
「Yes, thank you very much. I apologize for running about like this... I'll come by to talk again at a later date.」


Oono
「With your wife and child, perhaps?」
％Ｂ
「Yes, we would love to!」
％Ｂ
「It's taking quite some time...」
Kouji
「Hmm, I wonder if everything's okay...」
Marika went into the delivery room shortly after I ran to the hospital.
How many hours has it been since then?
％Ｂ
「I can't believe it takes this long... I'm worried.」
Kouji
「Yeah, this is just too...」
Yumi
「The first one takes time. It isn't strange for it to take half a day.」

％Ｂ
「But she was in so much pain...」
Yumi
「Don't worry. Women are strong. And it's not like the pain's constantly there.」

％Ｂ
「But Marika's...」
I swallow down my worries.
She isn't the same Marika from so long ago.
That's why she'll be okay.
Yumi
「You should sit down already. You're not some bear at a zoo.」
％Ｂ
「Okay...」
Baby
「Waaaaahhh! Waaaaaaaaahh!!」
％Ｂ
「Wha...」
Yumi
「Oh, look. There it is.」
％Ｂ
「She's born...」
I'm sitting there dumbstruck, my mind blank. Eventually the nurse comes outside.

Nurse
「She's given birth to a healthy baby girl. Please wait here for just a little longer.」

Yumi
「Oh, it's a girl.」
％Ｂ
「...」
Yumi
「Ryousuke-kun? She said it's a girl.」
Yumi
「Hello? She said it's a girl.」
Kouji
「Hey! You did it!」
％Ｂ
「...」
Yumi
「Oh? He's frozen up?」
％Ｂ
「...Uoooooooooooohhhhhh!!」
Yumi
「Hyah!?」
Kouji
「Whoa!?」
％Ｂ
「Yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh!!!」
I can't stop the scream of victory that's erupting from inside me. I can hardly believe it's me yelling.

Baby
「Waaaaahhh!! Waaaaaahhh!!」
The baby cries vigorously, as if in response to my voice.

After a while, we're let inside so we can see the baby.
My impressions upon seeing my child for the first time are...
％Ｂ
「People say babies look like monkeys, but she doesn't look anything like a monkey. She's probably an angel, if you ask me.」


Marika
「Hehe. You're so biased.」
％Ｂ
「But just look at her! You've never seen a baby this cute, have you?」
We've gone to the gynecologist a lot since Marika got pregnant.
I've seen several other people's babies, but none of them were this cute.
％Ｂ
「She's definitely an angel.」
Marika
「Hehe... You're right. She's our little angel.」

Our angelic baby's sleeping peacefully.
She's sleeping so quietly I can hardly believe that she was the one crying up a storm earlier.

My vision blurs as I'm watching her.
％Ｂ
「Huh?」
That's weird. I rub my eyes.
Something warm wets my fingers.
Marika
「...Are you crying?」
％Ｂ
「No... It's just, the tears are coming out on their own...」
My tears are silently dripping out.
％Ｂ
「I dunno... what to say...」
There's an enormous emotion of some kind piercing through my chest along with the tears.
But I don't know how to describe it with words.\n\r
My tears keep coming as I struggle to find a way to describe how I feel.
％Ｂ
「...Thank you.」
Those are the words I find coming out of my mouth.
Marika
「Thank you?」
％Ｂ
「Thank you for giving birth to such a cute, healthy baby.」
I direct my words to Marika.
They're words from the bottom of my heart.
Marika
「Ryousuke...」
Marika
「Oh...」
I can see Marika's eyes glisten too.
％Ｂ
「And... thank you for being born to us.」

I direct those words to my sleeping child.
Thank you so very much.
My gratitude is genuine.
I want to express my gratitude to Marika, to everyone I've met up until now, to everything...
To this whole world.\n\r
I have the feeling that if even one thing were missing, I wouldn't have been able to meet this child.
Gratitude surges up in me. I can't stop my tears.\n \n\r

Marika's quietly smiling while crying too.
Marika
「It's very nice to meet you, my cute little angel.」
％Ｂ
「Same from me.」
The two of us gently speak to our child.
She just keeps quietly sleeping, as if our words were nothing more than a gentle breeze.

％Ｂ
「I'm going to be leaving directly from the site today.」
Azuma
「Ah, right. Your wife's getting out of the hospital today, right?」
％Ｂ
「That's right.」
Marika's going to be discharged from the hospital today.
She was deemed able to safely leave with the baby, so I need to go pick her up.

all
Firm Staff B
「Huh～ Well that was quick.」
％Ｂ
「Fortunately. Looks like both mother and child are healthy.」
The two of them are both doing great, thanks to the doctors.
In fact, Marika's been saying that her body's only gotten tougher after having the baby.

Firm Staff A
「Speaking of which, did you decide on a name for your kid?」
％Ｂ
「Oh, yes. It's "Mirai," as in the future.」
Firm Staff B
「Mirai-chan?」
Firm Staff A
「Huh～ ...What's the story behind that name?」
％Ｂ
「We wanted a name that would celebrate her being born. We thought of lots of names, but when I saw her... we just knew that it had to be that one.」


％Ｂ
「And there's also the fact that she's our "future" too.」
Firm Staff B
「Wow～ I like it.」
Firm Staff A
「You're a full-on doting parent now. I'm jealous, though.」
％Ｂ
「And so, I need to go pick up my future. I'll need to go get a rental car too, so I'll be leaving now.」

Firm Staff A
「You'll have to hurry and get a car now that you've got a kid.」
％Ｂ
「I'm saving up for one now. Goodbye, then.」

Azuma
「Say hi to your wife and Mirai-chan for me.」
％Ｂ
「Yes! I certainly will!」
I drive to the hospital in a rental car, then start heading home with the two of them in tow.
Our child's sleeping peacefully through her first car ride.
Marika
「She's such a quiet girl.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, 'cause she's an angel.」
％Ｂ
「...Oh.」
Marika
「What's wrong?」
％Ｂ
「The sky's... Can I pull over real quick?」
Marika
「Okay?」
I stop the car and step outside.
Marika steps out too, holding the baby.
Marika
「What's wrong?」
％Ｂ
「Oh, look...」
I point toward the sky.
A star streaks across our field of view.
Marika
「Oh, a shooting star...」
％Ｂ
「It's the Perseid meteor shower.」
Marika
「W-Wah～ ...So this is it...」
％Ｂ
「That's right... It's happening today. I checked it a while back, but I completely forgot about it.」

Marika
「There's another one... This is amazing～」
％Ｂ
「It looks like there are a lot this year.」
We see several more stars streak across the sky as we watch.
Marika
「...We were finally able to see the Perseid meteor shower together. I feel like we finally got to fulfill all the promises we made back when we were kids.」

She smiles up at the night sky.
％Ｂ
「Yeah. We'll have to make more promises, then. We'll wish on the stars.」

Marika
「Oh, again? ...Like back when we were kids?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. We'll be the ones to make those wishes come true... but you can't make a wish come true if you never make one in the first place, right?」


Marika
「...You're right. If you wish for it, it'll come true.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. That's right.」
Marika
「Then... Let's watch the Perseid meteor shower together every year from now on, as a family. We'll do it next year, the year after that, and the year after that too...」


％Ｂ
「Yeah. Let's do it together every year. I want Mirai to see this starry night as soon as possible too.」

％Ｂ
「...Hm?」
Marika
「Oh? She's looking at the stars.」
Mirai's got her eyes open slightly, looking up at the starry sky.

％Ｂ
「Maybe she can see them?」
Marika
「Ahaha, she can't see yet～ I heard she'll be able to after about three months.」

％Ｂ
「But it really looks like she can see them.」
Marika
「You're right.」
％Ｂ
「Hm?」
Marika
「Oh, she smiled just now.」
％Ｂ
「Right? She can totally see them.」
Marika
「You might be right. Mirai, let's wish on the stars together, okay?」

Marika addresses Mirai.
And Mirai laughs in response.
I feel like I can see the darkness of the night flash brighter for an instant.
This girl really is our "future."
The two of us have to do our best, so this "future" can keep on shining forever.

Marika
「Oh, there's another shooting star～ Wow, it's so pretty.」
％Ｂ
「Then... when we see the next one, we'll both... No. The three of us will make a wish together.」
Marika
「Okay! We have to pay close attention～」

％Ｂ
「Okay! It's gonna come from over there!」
Marika
「...Oh, there it is!」
The two of us close our eyes, hold Mirai tight, and make a quiet wish.

...For these happy times to go on forever.
