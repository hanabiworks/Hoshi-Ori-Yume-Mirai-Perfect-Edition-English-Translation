It's the day after my second exam.
The exam questions have been put up on the qualification exam homepage, which means we can score our answers.
I've come to the Azuma Architectural Firm for the first time in a while to have Teacher look over my answers from yesterday.

％Ｂ
「...How did I do?」
He lapsed into thought after looking between the blueprint I drew out and the exam prompts.
His eyes move rapidly from side to side, taking in the entirety of the design, all the way down to specific measurements.

Azuma
「...How long did it take you to draft this out?」
％Ｂ
「Let's see... About four hours. I used the hour I had left to check over my calculations to make sure I didn't make any errors.」


Azuma
「Really. I see...」
...Things seem grim.
I was pretty confident, but maybe I made some kind of huge mistake...!?
％Ｂ
「U-Um... Did I make some kind of mistake somewhere...?」
Azuma
「...I'm not an examiner, so I can't say I'm completely sure about this... but I'll give you just one piece of advice.」

％Ｂ
「...Wh-What is it...?」
Azuma
「If you're planning on going for it, then start studying for the first-class exams today. Hmph. Just look at how disgustingly perfect this blueprint is... You're no fun at all.」


％Ｂ
「Wha... Wait, so does that mean... you think I'll pass?」
Azuma
「I think you'll be fine. As long as you haven't forgotten to write your name on it or anything.」
％Ｂ
「Really!? All right! Thank god...!」
Joy slowly seeps into me.
I don't know for sure whether I've passed yet, but I think I can be confident now that I've gotten Teacher's seal of approval.

I feel the joy of finally being able to take the first step toward my dream, after all those long days of studying.\n\r

It's a small step... but I feel like my world's already gotten so much bigger all at once.
Azuma
「Looks like I'll have to start thinking seriously about hiring you. I'll have to clear out that desk over there, get a computer for you... Hmm, I think I'll need to move a decent amount of stuff around...」


％Ｂ
「I can clean it out! Since it's the desk that I'll be using!」

Azuma
「...You just love doing work, don't you? It's not like we know for sure yet, all right?」

all
Mr. Azuma established an absolute minimum for me to be hired at the Azuma Architectural Firm.
"To attain second-class architect qualifications before I graduated university."
He said he would only want someone who could immediately be put to work right out of school.
He said that to me right after I started university, so that became the central focus for my university life.

Azuma
「Listen here. Anyone can become qualified if they study enough. I still need to make sure you'll be useful on top of those qualifications... so you're gonna get the hiring exam just like everyone else, all right?」


％Ｂ
「That's fine! I'll pass for sure! Thank you very much!」

all
％Ｂ
「Oh, right. I wanted to talk to you about something involving Touko... Would you mind?」

I call out to Teacher as I start cleaning out the desk.
I want to talk to him about Touko wanting to take the qualification exam to become an interior design coordinator.
Azuma
「You wanna talk? What, you two get in a fight or something?」
％Ｂ
「No, you see... Touko's been studying to prepare for taking an interior design coordinator exam for about two months now.」

Azuma
「What's going on? You told me Touko-chan was going to be working at a travel agency.」

％Ｂ
「...She apparently declined the job offer. She said she wanted the pressure to pass.」

Azuma
「Well that was reckless of her. That exam's in... October, right?」

％Ｂ
「Yes. I was going to try to teach her as much as I could, but there just isn't enough time...」

Azuma
「How did this end up happening in the first place? It seems awfully late for her to suddenly be interested in a subject like that.」

％Ｂ
「...It's a bit embarrassing, but...」
all
％Ｂ
「...And that's about the gist of it.」
I told him the main points of what I had discussed with Touko back then.
I can't spot any emotion on his face other than exasperation.

Azuma
「...So what, did you just wanna brag to me about that or something?」
％Ｂ
「N-No, I didn't! This is a serious issue I'm worrying over! I was wondering if that was really okay...!」

Azuma
「What do you have to worry about? You're supporting Touko-chan as she's preparing for her exam, right? What the hell do you want me to say about that?」


％Ｂ
「...Because she's clearly trying to follow after me, so I was wondering if she might be forcing herself for my sake.」

Azuma
「Forcing herself? Why would you think that?」
％Ｂ
「I think it might be better for her to find something else... Something she actually wants to do.」

It's not like Touko originally had an interest in architecture.\n \n\r
I feel like... getting that qualification wouldn't be anything more than a burden to her if she found something she wanted to do more.

Azuma
「You don't know until you try. She just might get even more into this industry than you are.」

％Ｂ
「No, I don't know about that... though she did say she's finally started to understand what I find interesting about it recently.」

Azuma
「You and Touko-chan are both adults already. You can decide what you want to do yourselves, without anyone else telling you what to do. You've done the same thing already.」


％Ｂ
「...Yes.」
Azuma
「Your job is to be understanding of Touko-chan's feelings. If you wanna support her or point her in a different direction, then you can decide on what you do yourself after giving it some proper thought.」


％Ｂ
「...」
Azuma
「If you want any advice from me, well... Women are more determined than you think. You're only gonna end up having a bad time if you underestimate them.」


％Ｂ
「...Are you speaking from personal experience?」
Azuma
「Pretty much. Nothing good ever comes from underestimating women. Damn, those are some bad memories.」

...I'd be interested in hearing stories about his past.
I wonder if he'd let some slip if I asked him about things over some alcohol?
Azuma
「...What's that look for? You look like you wanna say, "Please tell me more about that."」

％Ｂ
「Wha!? No, that's not...!」
Firm Staff A
「He lost to an old girlfriend of his once at a competition. He must still be sour about that.」

Azuma
「Wha!? What are you...!? Who said you could say anything without my permission!?」
％Ｂ
「Thank you very much. Wow, so he... I can't imagine that at all.」

Firm Staff A
「Right? Man, things got crazy back then. This crazy intense fight started up after that, and more than half the furniture in the office ended up having to be replaced. It's a miracle no one was hurt.」


That's too intense to be called a fight...
That's more like a war...
Azuma
「Hmph, that's all in the past. We were both drunk back then too... And besides, she's the one who threw her cup first! It clearly wasn't my fault.」


Firm Staff A
「What are you saying? We didn't get any work done for at least a week after that, and you forced us to come out with you late every night to drink with you... We were the ones who got the worst of it.」


Azuma
「...So what I'm hearing is that you wanna see hell for your next performance review.」
Firm Staff A
「Whah!? Th-That has nothing to do with this! It isn't okay to bring personal feelings into professional matters!」

Azuma
「
Hino
You
, keep this in mind. Don't say anything that doesn't need saying. It's true for both superiors at work and women. Looks like you're learning new things here already.」


Firm Staff A
「Wha, Mr. Azuma!? Anything but a bad performance review! I still have to pay back the loan for my car!」

％Ｂ
「A-Ahahaha...」
all
So my job is to be understanding of Touko's feelings...
She's been putting so much effort into studying lately.
I'm cheering Touko on, of course, and I want to support her as much as I can.

But... I just couldn't help but think that she might be forcing herself to do all this for my sake.

Teacher said women are determined.
I've seen parts of Touko that make me think that too, of course, but... To be honest, I don't really know.

Azuma
「Women get stubborn and they'll overexert themselves if it's for the man they love. They're the same as men. They're just as stupid as we are.」

％Ｂ
「...Yes.」
Azuma
「If there's any difference... it's probably the way they think about their futures. If you wanna be mean about it, you could say they're calculating.」

Touko's looking toward her future.
She told me that she wanted to support me both in my private life and in my work as an architect.

Azuma
「Touko-chan knows men well too. It's rare to have a woman thinking so much for your sake, you know. You should consider yourself lucky as a man.」


Firm Staff A
「I'm jealous... I'm over here with a girlfriend who's controlling my wallet. We haven't even talked about getting married yet...」

Azuma
「That's just because you're careless. That's what happens when you let your guard down.」

％Ｂ
「I'm the same way. Touko handles all of the household finances for us.」
all
Firm Staff A
「Seriously!? I see, so you know that pain too!」
...He's sympathizing with me over something weird.
I think I won't comment. I feel like the conversation would become kind of a pain if it continued any further.

Anyway, what I can do now is support Touko.
I've already decided to do that, so I've gotta give it my all.
