％Ｂ
「Yes, who is iiit?」
Touko
「Good morning. I'm glad you were home.」
％Ｂ
「Huh? Were you coming over today? Did I miss a message or something?」

Touko
「No, I just wanted to surprise you. I thought you'd be home at least this early in the morning.」

％Ｂ
「Wanna come in? I don't really have anything out though, 'cause I just woke up.」

Touko
「Mhm, please excuse the intrusion.」
Touko
「Sorry I couldn't do anything yesterday.」
％Ｂ
「It's fine. I went over to the firm anyway. And besides, you're here today.」

Touko
「Mhm. We haven't spent a day off together in a while.」
％Ｂ
「What do you wanna do today? We could relax at home... or if you want, we could go out to the city.」

It'd be a waste to spend an entire day doing nothing inside after summer break's only just started.\n\r

Though it is pretty hot out...
％Ｂ
「By the way, are you prepared for the Tanabata Festival?」
Touko
「Huh? Prepared?」
％Ｂ
「You know, like a yukata and stuff.」
Touko
「I don't have a yukata. Since this'll be my first time going to a festival in general.」

％Ｂ
「I see...」
Touko
「Oh, are you depressed? Is it that much of a shock to you that I don't have a yukata?」

％Ｂ
「...No, not really.」
But come on... when you say summer festival, you think of a yukata, right...!?
And you're saying I won't get to see that... Of course I'd be down...!
Touko
「Ahahah! Looks like we know what we're doing for our date today!」
％Ｂ
「Huh?」
Touko
「Let's go buy a yukata together. It's not like I'm completely uninterested, and if I'm going to get one, then I want you to pick it out for me.」


all
Touko
「It's so hot today agaaain... Wanna go somewhere cool and take a bit of a break?」

％Ｂ
「At least we're not getting any direct sunlight here. Maybe we shouldn't stick too close today if it's that hot for you?」

Touko
「...I can't believe you could be so mean. I hate you.」
％Ｂ
「Sorry, my bad. I was kidding. I don't care if it's hot.」

I grab her by the hand and pull her close, to her usual position.
I'm conscious of the people nearby looking at us, but I'm feeling too good right now to not do this.

Touko
「...This is a bit embarrassing, you know.」
％Ｂ
「...And you should know this is about how close you usually get.」

Touko
「Hgh... Doing it myself and having you do it to me are completely different
, Ryousuke-kun

!」

％Ｂ
「Aagh!?」
She grabs my arm tight.
She's pushing her boobs onto me, and I can smell her smell and feel her softness...!
Touko
「We're staying like this today! I'm not going to let go for a while, okay!?」
all
The two of us start a thorough perusal of yukata.
She holds each of them up to her body and we repeat simulations over and over.
Touko
「Mmm... What about this one?」
％Ｂ
「Let's see... It's not bad. But I think something a little more trendy and stylish might look better on you.」

Touko
「Then how about... this one?」
％Ｂ
「Hmm... The color's all right... but don't you think the pattern's kinda meh?」

Touko
「You're so picky... This is new... Since when did you have such complicated preferences?」

％Ｂ
「It's a yukata we're talking about here! I don't wanna make any compromises!」
Touko
「...Shouldn't I be the one saying that?」
We haven't found one that's really jumped out at me.
I want to find one where the color and patterning fit Touko perfectly, no matter what. I want something that just screams, "This is the one!"

Touko
「Geez... Then this one's next. What do you think?」
％Ｂ
「...Yeah. This one's a candidate. The color and pattern aren't too flashy, and it's still pretty.」

Touko
「Really? Then maybe I'll go with this one.」
％Ｂ
「Wait, Touko. We'll set this one off to the side for now. I want to see other kinds too.」

Touko
「...You don't have a yukata fetish, do you?」
％Ｂ
「Of course not. This is pretty normal, I think.」
Touko
「I don't really think so... Your eyes are so serious.」
It would be the height of presumption for someone having only my level of passion for this to call themselves a yukata fetishist.\n\r
I would have to apologize to the serious folks out there for my insolence.
Touko
「Let's look through a few more, then. I'll stick with you until you're satisfied, since we've already gotten this far.」

％Ｂ
「All right, this one's next! And then this one... Oh, and that one's good too!」

all
Touko
「Ehehe, we bought one.」
％Ｂ
「I'm excited. I'll get to go on a Tanabata Festival date with you while you're wearing a yukata.」
all
I'm happy that the two of us can look forward to the same thing like this so naturally.
But at the same time... I'm scared.
Our time together is limited.
If my time together with Touko disappears, I...
Touko
「...? What's wrong? Are you that impatient to see me in a yukata?」
％Ｂ
「Huh? Oh, uh...」
...Let's not think about that.
I need to be more positive. Enjoy the now.
Touko
「Hey, wanna take a break? I'm a little tired, and I want to drink something cold.」

％Ｂ
「Oh, that sounds good. Let's take it easy somewhere with air conditioning!」
Touko
「Ahaha, you're looking chipper now. Maybe we should eat lunch too while we're at it? We'll be going around to lots of stores in the afternoon today.」


％Ｂ
「That's a good idea. Let's eat before the restaurants get crowded.」
We can hold hands like this right now.
Let's not regret the passage of time... and enjoy the present with everything we have instead.
all
Touko
「Wanna start heading back now? Since we have event committee work tomorrow.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, we should... Still, though... I'm tired after walking around so much today...」
Touko
「Maybe you got too serious about picking out that yukata? You didn't let me make any compromises at all.」

％Ｂ
「It's a once-in-a-year festival, though. If you're gonna wear a yukata, you gotta do it right. It's normal to get that serious.」

Touko
「I'm pretty sure that's what people call a fetish, though...」
I wonder if I'm gonna end up having to try on tons of aprons at some point.
Please, at least spare me from wearing a frilly one...
Touko
「You're so interesting
, Ryousuke-kun

. You keep showing me more and more new sides of you. I'll never get bored like this.」


％Ｂ
「...Yeah, I'd like it if you wouldn't.」
Touko
「Ahahah! Don't worry, don't worry. I'm having fun every day. I'm sure I won't ever get bored.」

I can feel Touko's "ever" prick me in the heart.
It brings to mind the inescapable reality ahead of us. My smile falters for a moment.

Touko
「...What's wrong?」
％Ｂ
「No, nothing. I just hope tomorrow's a little cooler.」
I can't let myself get torn up about it.
I need to build up our days together, so I can accept and overcome all of this properly.

Touko
「Hey, wanna trade lunches tomorrow? I'll try my best and make something too.」

％Ｂ
「Seriously!? That'd be awesome! You've never made me lunch before!」

Touko
「Don't expect too much, okay? I'm not that good at cooking.」

％Ｂ
「Remember how you made breakfast for us before that one time? I was super happy back then too, so I'm really looking forward to it!」

Touko
「...Oh god, that's a lot of pressure.」
％Ｂ
「So what are you gonna make? We gotta make sure we don't end up making the same thing.」

Touko
「I'm still thinking about it, and I won't tell you once I've decided either! It's fine if you make the same thing I do. I'll eat aaall of it.」

％Ｂ
「You sure? Well... If you're fine with it.」
The more we build something up, the more of an impact it'll have when it falls.\n\r

It's the same for both building materials and feelings.
But I want to continue to build up my memories with Touko regardless.

I want to just build up fun days together with her right now.
Touko
「I might be a bit late in coming to pick you up tomorrow. We might be kinda short on time.」

％Ｂ
「Want me to come to your place, then? I might as well, since you're always the one coming to mine.」

Touko
「Now, now. It's fine. We can just apologize together to Four-Eyes-kun if we're late.」

We make more promises with every passing day.
The promise at the very end... is the Tanabata Festival.
％Ｂ
「I don't really wanna apologize to Shuuichi. I'll think of some way to argue about it with him.」

Touko
「I'll try my best so we're not late too. Though I'm not too confident.」

％Ｂ
「We can just worry about that tomorrow.」
all
The hands of the clock move bit by bit.
The limited time we have is slowly, but surely being shaved away.
But despite that... we gaze at the present, and slowly start on our way home.
