After school.
％Ｂ
「Mmm... All right... Time for some committee―」
Natsuki
「We're gonna do some grad-alb committee work!」
％Ｂ
「...Why.」
Natsuki
「You're my assistant, aren't you? You promised to come with me for my committee work.」

％Ｂ
「I did, but... Let me at least stop by the committee office first.」
Natsuki
「Why?」
％Ｂ
「You know what my actual role is already.」
Natsuki
「You're my assistant.」
％Ｂ
「My role is to support the astronomy and naturalist clubs as a member of the event committee!」

Natsuki
「I know that, but you don't need to go to the committee office, do you? Why don't you just go straight to the clubs?」

％Ｂ
「...They haven't submitted any formal participation paperwork yet. They're still deferring their decisions for now.」

Natsuki
「Then that's even more reason to go directly to tell them to hurry and submit the paperwork, isn't it?」

％Ｂ
「I don't wanna rush them. I want the two of them to properly decide to participate before they submit it.」

Natsuki
「That seems kinda roundabout.」
％Ｂ
「I know it is. But I don't want to mess things up by rushing them.」
Natsuki
「Then why do you wanna go to the committee office?」
％Ｂ
「I want to see if they've submitted that paperwork yet.」
Natsuki
「...Can I just ask the two of them over LIME right now?」
％Ｂ
「No.」
Natsuki
「But it'd be faster to ask directly!」
％Ｂ
「I told you, that's not the point!」
Shuuichi
「Oh, there you are. Both of you.」
Marika
「How was class? This is perfect timing. We have great news for you two―」

all
Natsuki
「Your way of doing things is slow and annoying!」
％Ｂ
「I'm not gonna just charge in at everything like you do!」

Shuuichi
「Looks like they're arguing about something.」
Marika
「U-Umm?」
all
％Ｂ
「Hey, Shuuichi! How about you tell this barbarian of a woman how it's important to be careful of how you progress things!」

Natsuki
「You'd knock on a stone bridge, and then end up not crossing anyway! You're past careful at that point, you're just a coward! Isn't that right, Marika!?」

Shuuichi
「I don't really understand what you two are arguing about...」
Marika
「Let's calm down... and get along, okay?」
Natsuki
「Nirasawa! What's going on with the astronomy and naturalist clubs?」
％Ｂ
「Shuuichi! Have the astronomy and naturalist clubs turned in that paperwork?」
Marika
「Oh... I guess they do get along.」
Shuuichi
「Yeah. We just got it.」
all
Natsuki
「There. Business done. Let's get going then.」
％Ｂ
「Tch... Fine.」
Natsuki
「...」
％Ｂ
「...」
all
Ryousuke・Natsuki
％Ｂ
「What'd you just say!?」
Natsuki
「What did you just say!?」
％Ｂ・Natsuki
％Ｂ
「What'd you just say!?」
Natsuki
「What did you just say?」
Shuuichi
「Uh... I said, we got their participation paperwork.」
all
％Ｂ
「...You hear that?」
Natsuki
「Yeah...」
We simultaneously raise our hands and high-five.

Ryousuke・Natsuki
％Ｂ
「All right!」
Natsuki
「All right!」
％Ｂ・Natsuki
％Ｂ
「All right!」
Natsuki
「All right!」
Shuuichi
「Uhh... You guys done arguing now? Both of you sit down there, then.」

all
Segawa and I do as Shuuichi asks.
Shuuichi
「As I just said, we got the paperwork from both the astronomy and naturalist clubs for participation in the Tanabata Festival.」

Shuuichi
「I think it's thanks to the effort you've put in with Shinozaki
, Ryousuke

. Good work.」

％Ｂ
「We did it, Shinozaki.」
Marika
「Yeah!」
Shuuichi
「This isn't the end, obviously. The event committee's work doesn't stop until the festival displays are a success. We're going to be supporting both clubs the whole time.」


％Ｂ
「Yeah, I know. We'll need to have them figure out what they'll be doing at the festival as soon as possible first. I'll go meet with them after this.」


Shuuichi
「No, there's no need. Both clubs have already written down what they'll be doing on the paperwork.」

％Ｂ
「Wha...?」
Marika
「It seems like Okihara-san and Ousaka-san were both putting a lot more thought into the festival than we thought.」

％Ｂ
「Really...」
％Ｂ
「So what are they doing, then?」
Shuuichi
「They're both going to be displays, looks like. The astronomy club's doing a panel on constellations and mythology, and the naturalist club's apparently going to make a mini marine zoo, focused on local marine wildlife.」


％Ｂ
「A panel on constellations and a mini marine zoo. Yeah, those don't sound bad at all.」
all
Natsuki
「Sounds kinda normal. How about the astronomy club does a planetarium, and the naturalist club does a restaurant that only uses the freshest local fish?」


％Ｂ
「Don't be ridiculous. We only have so much time.」

Shuuichi
「Your ideas are interesting, Segawa, but let's just do what's possible for now.」
Natsuki
「Ohh, you're right. I guess that's true, since each club only has one member.」
all
Shuuichi
「Back on subject. Both clubs have decided what they'll be doing, so the next order of business is to actually start preparing for those things. I've decided to pick some people to be in charge of supporting them.」


％Ｂ
「I thought Shinozaki and I were in charge of that.」
Shuuichi
「You're not going to have enough manpower with just the two of you, right? Since both clubs only have one member each.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, that's true.」
Shuuichi
「First, the astronomy club. I'll be in charge of it directly. Shinozaki's in charge of the naturalist club.」
％Ｂ
「Uh... What about me?」
Shuuichi
「You and Segawa do both.」
％Ｂ
「Both?」
Shuuichi
「Shinozaki and I are going to mainly support one club each. You two are going to support both clubs, helping out whichever one needs more help at the time.」


％Ｂ
「We'll help out whichever club needs more help at the time...」
Shuuichi
「This might be rougher on you guys than for us... But, I'll be counting on you two to do a good job.」

Natsuki
「Just so you know, I still have my own work as a grad-alb committee member, so I won't be able to focus entirely on that.」

％Ｂ
「You said you'd help with event committee work in exchange for me being your assistant, though.」

Natsuki
「And I'll hold myself to that, of course. But I'm just saying I don't want you to expect too much of me.」

Shuuichi
「Well, sorry about this, but I'm actually expecting a ton out of you, Segawa. No joke.」

Marika
「If anything, it's kind of like the success of both of the clubs' displays hinges on you, Segawa-san.」
Natsuki
「What? ...What's that supposed to mean?」
Shuuichi
「It's because of a direct request from the clubs. Both the astronomy and naturalist clubs want you to take photos for them to use for their displays.」


Natsuki
「They want to use my photos?」
Shuuichi
「Let's start with the astronomy club's display. We're going to make decorations and panels with myths on them. But she apparently wants the images of the constellations that go with each story to be photos of actual stars.」


Marika
「The naturalist club's marine zoo is going to display as much wildlife as possible at school, but Okihara-san said she wanted photos of the ones we won't be able to display, showing how they'd be in their natural habitat.」


Natsuki
「Photos of real constellations, and photos of wildlife in their natural habitat...」
Shuuichi
「"Photos" are going to be important to both displays. I think it might not be an exaggeration to say your photos might end up determining how well the displays go in general.」

Shuuichi
「I'll be honest. I considered asking the photography club to cooperate with us. But both the astronomy and naturalist clubs specifically asked for you.」

％Ｂ
「Oh... Maybe after they saw the photos from when we went camping, they thought you could... Or something?」

Marika
「Yeah, those photos were pretty, and they were taken really well.」
Shuuichi
「You get why I said I'm expecting a ton out of you now?」

Natsuki
「...」
all
％Ｂ
「Hey... You sure about this? If you don't think you'll be able to do both at the same time, we could ask the photography club like Shuuichi said and―」

Natsuki
「...Fu... Fufu... Fufufufufu...」
％Ｂ
「...Segawa...san?」
Natsuki
「Hahahaha, ahahahah! It's here, it's here! Here it is! Someone's requesting my personal skills!」

％Ｂ
「Uh...」
Segawa clenches her fist and claps her other hand against her bicep.
Natsuki
「Leeeave it to me!」
She declares it confidently, her eyes glittering.
Natsuki
「I don't care if it's constellations or wildlife, I'll capture all of it! Segawa Natsuki knows no impossibilities when it comes to photography!」

％Ｂ
「...You're just filled with confidence, huh...」
I don't really know what kinda basis she has for it...
But I guess this is just like her.
Shuuichi
「I thought you'd say so. Which is why I already told both clubs that you'd do it.」

％Ｂ
「You know her personality way too well...」
Shuuichi
「You'll have to meet with each of the clubs to discuss what specifically you'll be taking photos of.」

Natsuki
「Roger that! Okay, then let's get going! C'mon, stand up!」

％Ｂ
「Wha... I'm coming too?」
all
Natsuki
「Obviously! You're my assistant!」
％Ｂ
「Hey, don't pull me like that! I'm off, then.」
Shuuichi
「Counting on you.」
Marika
「I'll go to the naturalist club in a bit, so I'll see you there.」
Shuuichi
「Still though, Segawa's one thing, but does\n\r
Ryousuke 
he 
understand what his actual role is?」

Shuuichi
「He's probably in the most critical position, since he has to back up both the astronomy and naturalist clubs, and also support Segawa...」


Marika
「I'm sure 
Hino-kun will 
he'll 
manage!」
