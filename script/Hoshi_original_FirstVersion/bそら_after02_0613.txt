I've come to Azuma-san's firm once again with the ten or twenty new rough drafts I've drawn up.

Azuma
「...」
％Ｂ
「...」
Azuma
「...Rejected.」
％Ｂ
「Gh...」
Again...
％Ｂ
「Th-Then... What do you think about this one?」
Azuma
「Rejected.」
％Ｂ
「...Actually, I think this one came out quite well.」
Azuma
「Rejected.」
％Ｂ
「Kh... H-How about this one―」
Azuma
「Rejected. All of them.」
Y-You've gotta be kidding me...
Do you even know how many of these I've even brought?
It's more than double what I brought last time.
But he's not interested in even a single one? What's that supposed to mean?
What the hell... I don't get it.
％Ｂ
「E-Excuse me, but... I took quite a lot of time and drew up many different drafts... But you're saying they're all not good enough?」

Azuma
「Isn't that what I just said?」
％Ｂ
「What about them is lacking?」
Azuma
「Think about that for yourself.」
％Ｂ
「...I have. I thought about it, and I drew all of these after thinking. If it still isn't enough, then please tell me why.」

I'm actually being defiant toward Azuma-san for once.
I've never gotten angry at Azuma-san before.
It might be that I'm a little ticked off and sleep deprived...
But I'm just not okay with this.
I tried to give shape to the ideas I've been building up with everything I have.\n\r
I brought myself all the way here, trying to remain sensitive to my inspiration as I let my ideas grow.
And that's why─
Azuma
「If the things you made after you thought about it have all been rejected, then that means your thought process has been wrong from the start.」

％Ｂ
「And that's why I'm asking you to tell me what I'm doing wrong!」
That's why this response from Azuma-san feels to me like I'm... like my memories are being rejected.

All goes quiet in the firm when I yell, and the staff members look at us.

Junior Firm Staff
「S-Senpai...」
Azuma
「...」
％Ｂ
「...」
I can tell that things have gotten tense.
But I can't hold it in.
I did all this, even causing Sora trouble on the way, and he's just going to try to end it with nothing more than "Rejected"...!

Azuma
「...Sigh... You know... Mr. Hino Architectural Firm.」
He sighs and starts speaking.
The way he addresses me by my firm's name instead of my name like usual makes his disappointment apparent.

Azuma
「...Sigh... You know... I think you might be misunderstanding something.」
He sighs and starts speaking.
Azuma
「Do you understand what this is? It's a collaborative effort between your firm and mine. But it's also a distributed effort.」

％Ｂ
「...I understand that... Of course I do.」
Azuma
「If you really understood, then you wouldn't keep bringing rough drafts like these.」

Azuma
「I already told you, didn't I? I'm busy over here. Don't waste my time. Hurry up and go back to your firm and draw up some more.」


all
Azuma-san rises from the couch and walks to the back of the office.

％Ｂ
「...Gh!」
I leave the firm and stride through the city, still livid.
Junior Firm Staff
「Senpai...! Please wait! Senpai!」
I turn around. One of the Azuma Architectural Firm staff members who was once my junior is running to catch up with me.

Junior Firm Staff
「Hahh, hahh... Thank god I caught up... Hahh...」
％Ｂ
「...What do you want? You've got work to do, don't you?」
Junior Firm Staff
「I do... but there's something I had to tell you...」

％Ｂ
「...Something you had to tell me?」
Junior Firm Staff
「Um... That job manual that you made for us before you left the firm... It's been very useful!」

％Ｂ
「...」
Junior Firm Staff
「I'm still not good enough to replace you yet, and Chief gets angry with me a lot... but it really has been useful... I just wanted to thank you properly... Thank you very much!」


％Ｂ
「...You came chasing after me just to say that?」
Junior Firm Staff
「Well, because... You left angry... I kind of got the feeling you wouldn't come to the firm anymore.」

％Ｂ
「...」
Junior Firm Staff
「I think Chief's expecting amazing things out of you, Senpai. I think that might be why he's not really giving you any okays for your rough drafts...」

％Ｂ
「...So he's allowed to expect whatever of me or criticize whatever he wants about me... Being on the receiving end of that's a real pain in the ass...」

Junior Firm Staff
「That's... But, he really is expecting good things from you! He still says to this day that our firm would've been set for life if you had stayed.」


％Ｂ
「...Even though he's been rejecting everything I've given him?」
Junior Firm Staff
「He... I don't know why he isn't approving of your drafts.」

Junior Firm Staff
「But one thing I can say for sure is that I think Chief is waiting. He's waiting for you to draw up a rough draft that surpasses anything he could've imagined.」


％Ｂ
「...」
Junior Firm Staff
「So, um... Please come to the firm again. Please don't give up, and...」

％Ｂ
「...There's no way I'd give up. You don't even know how many times my work was rejected back when I worked at the firm.」

％Ｂ
「I wouldn't be a disciple of Azuma Morio's if I gave up that easily.」

Junior Firm Staff
「Oh... Then...?」
％Ｂ
「I'll come again. Obviously. I'm gonna draw up something amazing next time and make him scream with approval. You better look forward to it!」


Junior Firm Staff
「Y-Yes! Good luck!」
％Ｂ
「...Phew.」
I return to the office, sit down at my desk, and let out a big breath.
I know I said all that, but I have absolutely no idea how to even start tackling the issue.

％Ｂ
「...I'm still nowhere close to good enough if I'm making my juniors worry about me...」
I guess I'll start with looking over everything I've done, to try to figure out what I did wrong...
Or maybe I'll go back to the school again to try to get some inspiration...
％Ｂ
「...Oh, actually... I gotta go check up on Shuuichi's house first...」
And my inbox is filled with stuff about remodeling consultations...
I have to organize what needs to be done first.
I stand up. Let's drink some water and calm down.
％Ｂ
「...????」
Wait, what? Why am I looking at the floor?
My legs feel weak... The inside of my head feels strangely cold.
％Ｂ
「Gh... kh... nh, hahh, hahh...」
I force myself up and heave myself onto the couch.
％Ｂ
「...Uh... What was I trying to do again...?」
My ears are ringing...
％Ｂ
「Oh yeah... I was gonna draw rough drafts for the cultural hall, and go back to Teacher's...」
The sound of my breathing's echoing in my head...
％Ｂ
「Wait... No... I was gonna check on Shuuichi's house... And then I fell, and then the rough drafts... Wait no, not the rough drafts...」

％Ｂ
「...I was gonna check up on the cultural hall... No... A rough draft for Shuuichi's house... Wait... No―」

My vision pulls away from behind, getting darker and darker.
And then I fall into darkness.
％Ｂ
「...」
％Ｂ
「...Where... am I...?」
This ceiling's... not my apartment ceiling... Where is this...?
Sora
「...Ryou...!」
Sora
「...Hgh!」
％Ｂ
「Wha...?」
I move my gaze upward. I see Sora peering in from above my head.
Her eyes are red and puffy.
％Ｂ
「Sora... What's wrong... Why are you crying?」
Sora
「...Because you passed out.」
Sora
「...Because you passed out.」
％Ｂ
「Wha...?」
all
I take another look around me at her words.
I'm in my office. I'm lying on the couch.
I reach up to my forehead to find a damp, well-wrung towel placed there.
％Ｂ
「...Oh... I passed out...」
Sora
「...*nod*」
Sora
「...I came after work like always and you were lying on the floor by the couch. You didn't wake up, even though I called your name over and over... And I...」


％Ｂ
「...Sorry... I must've made you worry.」
I raise my hand and stroke her cheek.
％Ｂ
「I think... I was just a little tired... I've been a bit sleep deprived lately... but I'm fine now...」


％Ｂ
「I'm late, but I need to go see Shuuichi's house and...」
Sora
「...Ryou...」
Sora
「...─me...」
％Ｂ
「Hm?」
Sora
「...Marry me.」
％Ｂ
「...Wha...?」
What...?
Was that Sora proposing to me just now?
I look at her blankly, and she continues.
Sora
「...I'll quit my job... I'll always be by your side... So... marry me, Ryou.」

Sora
「...I'll quit my job... I'll always be by your side... So... marry me.」

％Ｂ
「Wait a second, no... I'd love to marry you... I've been thinking about it too, of course... but you don't need to quit your job...」

Sora
「...This might happen again... I'm worried... I'm scared...」
Sora
「...This might happen again... I'm worried... I'm scared...」
％Ｂ
「...」
Sora
「...I can't take my eyes off of you now... You keep overexerting yourself, you keep overdoing it... What are you going to do if this happens again...?」

Sora
「...I can't take my eyes off of you now... You keep overexerting yourself, acting recklessly... What are you going to do if this happens again...?」

％Ｂ
「I...」
Sora
「...That's why I'll be by your side... I'll always be by your side... I'll watch to make sure it doesn't happen again... I'll support you... so please... marry me...」


Sora
「...That's why I'll be by your side... I'll always be by your side... I'll watch to make sure it doesn't happen again... I'll support you... so please... marry me...」


％Ｂ
「Sora...」
Agh... What the hell am I doing?
Why am I making Sora say something like this...?
These should be my words... I should be the one saying these words, but I'm making Sora...

And for such a pitiful reason...
I'm making Sora try to abandon her own dream...
My feverish mind cools a little.
My fuzzy thoughts get clearer and clearer.
I slowly sit up.
Sora
「...Oh... You should stay―」
I hug Sora tight.
％Ｂ
「Sora... I'm sorry.」
Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「I've made my girlfriend worry, and cry... and on top of that, I've even forced her to propose to me. I'm pathetic.」


Sora
「...*shake shake*」
Sora
「...You're my most important person, Ryou.」
Sora
「...You're my most important person.」
％Ｂ
「Thank you for feeling that way about me. You're the most important person in the world to me too, Sora. I want to be with you for the rest of my life.」


Sora
「...Then...」
％Ｂ
「But let's wait on marriage for just a little longer. Let me be the one to say it properly once the time comes.」

Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「I can't marry you if it means I'll be stealing your dream away from you.」
Sora
「...My dream...?」
％Ｂ
「Your dream's to communicate the wonders of the stars to lots of people, right?」
％Ｂ
「You're saying you're going to quit your job because of me, even though you're trying your hardest to make that dream come true right now... There's no way I could let you do that.」


％Ｂ
「But...」
％Ｂ
「I promise... I won't overdo it anymore. And I'll be the one to propose... I'll come to you. I swear.」


％Ｂ
「So please, wait just a little longer.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
Sora
「...Okay... That didn't count just now.」
％Ｂ
「Mhm... But thank you so much.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「...」
Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「...That was both of us, wasn't it?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「I guess people get hungry regardless of the situation.」
Sora
「...I bought a boxed meal before coming here. Eat it.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, I will.」
Sora
「...It's gotten cold, so I'll heat it up in the microwave. And I'll make tea too.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah... Thanks.」
all
I watch Sora as she walks to the kitchen, and then I pull out my rejected rough drafts and take a good look at them.

％Ｂ
「...Teacher wouldn't just randomly reject them...」
There has to be a reason why they weren't good enough.
I need to figure out what that is...
...It's always been this way.
He always puts hints in the things he says...
It was the same back when we made the dome for the planetarium back in high school...
I'm sure it's the same this time too...
I think back over my conversation with Azuma-san.
Azuma
『Rejected. All of them.』
Azuma
『If the things you made after you thought about it have all been rejected, then that means your thought process has been wrong from the start.』

％Ｂ
「...」
I have to be misunderstanding something.
There's something I'm still missing.
That's why he said that...
I remember he said to me before...
That if I want to be an architect, I shouldn't be so quick to ask others for answers.
Azuma
『...Sigh... You know... Mr. Hino Architectural Firm.』
％Ｂ
「...He specifically addressed me by my firm's name back then. He's not the kind of person to do something that passive-aggressive for no reason...」

Azuma
『...Sigh... You know... I think you might be misunderstanding something.』
％Ｂ
「...Misunderstanding... He means there's something I'm getting fundamentally wrong...」
Azuma
『Do you understand what this is? It's a collaborative effort between your firm and mine. But it's also a distributed effort.』

％Ｂ
「This job's a collaborative effort... but at the same time, a distributed effort...」
I'm in charge of the design.
It's the work that's been given to my firm. The work I need to do...
Azuma
『If you really understood, then you wouldn't keep bringing rough drafts like these.』

Azuma-san never said there was anything specifically wrong with any part of the rough drafts...
He was talking about the rough drafts themselves...
Junior Firm Staff
『I think Chief's expecting amazing things out of you, Senpai. I think that might be why he's not really giving you any okays for your rough drafts...』

Junior Firm Staff
『That's... But, he really is expecting good things from you! He still says to this day that our firm would've been set for life if you had stayed.』


The words I heard afterward, "He still says to this day that the Azuma Architectural Firm would've been set for life," seem important too...


Why would he say something like that after he rejected every single one of my drafts...?

Why, after looking at these drafts─
％Ｂ
「...Azuma would be... set for life...」
％Ｂ
「...」
％Ｂ
「...I get it... So that's why... What the hell... Haha... So that's why...!」

Sora
「...Ryou?」
Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「I've got it, Sora! I know why Teacher rejected my work!」
Sora
「...And that's...?」
％Ｂ
「It's simple. It's because I'm not Azuma Morio!」

Sora
「...? You're not Mo-san...?」
all
I get up from the couch, sit down at my desk, and pick up my pencil.
％Ｂ
「I'm me.」
I immediately get to work on a new rough draft.
