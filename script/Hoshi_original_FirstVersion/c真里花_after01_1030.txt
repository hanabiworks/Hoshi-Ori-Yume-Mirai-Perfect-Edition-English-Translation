「...Sigh.」
Marika
「What are you sighing for? You passed your exams.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, I did... but applying for the license cost a lot of money.」

Marika
「Whaaat～? How much?」
％Ｂ
「I've gotta get a local architectural guild to issue me a license... and it's gonna cost about 100,000 yen.」


Marika
「What!? It's that expensive!? Are you okay～ Are you sure that isn't some evil architectural guild～?」

％Ｂ
「An evil architectural guild...? It's the same all across the country. It's a national qualification.」


Marika
「Really. That's so expensive...」
％Ｂ
「And with all the prep school and textbooks... and the cost of taking the exams themselves, it's probably more than 100,000 in total.」

Marika
「It's rough even when you pass...」
％Ｂ
「I'm on the luckier side, since I passed on my first try, but it's still pretty harsh.」

％Ｂ
「That's why, uh... it's pathetic, but...」
I open up my bankbook.
Marika
「Oh no... You don't have any savings.」
％Ｂ
「Sorry I'm so lame.」
Marika
「Ahaha, I'm not worried about that at all～」
％Ｂ
「But getting married costs money too...」
Marika
「I don't think we need to spend that much money, you know.」
％Ｂ
「No, we can't do that. It's a once-in-a-lifetime thing.」

And the wedding ceremony's probably especially important for a girl.
A pretty wedding dress, a gorgeous ceremony, and a luxurious honeymoon...

Marika
「It really doesn't have to be so extravagant. I'm okay with a simple ceremony.」

％Ｂ
「But...」
Marika
「The wedding ceremony isn't what I want. What I want is to be your bride, Ryousuke.」

Marika
「The wedding ceremony isn't what I want. What I want is to be your bride.」

％Ｂ
「Marika...」
She just smiles quietly.
She's definitely not just saying that.
I can tell from that smile that she really means it.
But hearing something like that just makes me feel like I really need to get it together.

Marika
「And I actually have a lot saved up, you know. It's not like we're going to have the ceremony right away... so let's save up together, bit by bit.」


％Ｂ
「You're right. I'll save up and try my best too.」
Marika
「And so... Tada!」
Marika pulls out a box from the shopping bag she brought.
It's a big can.
It says "Let's save up 100,000 yen" on it.
％Ｂ
「A savings box?」
Marika
「Yeah. Let's save up money for our marriage in this, okay? We can put the small change we have left over at the end of the day in this.」

She happily places the can in the entranceway.
Marika
「I'll put money in here when I come over too.」
％Ｂ
「Okay, got it. I'll fill that thing up in no time.」
Marika
「Ahaha, you don't have to try too hard. Let's do it nice and slow.」

I need to hurry up and get it together... is what I think, but Marika's really calm and composed compared to me.\n\r

She even looks like she's enjoying our current situation.
Just seeing her like that gets me to calm down too.
％Ｂ
「I'm glad I fell in love with you, Marika.」
Marika
「Huh? Why so suddenly...?」
％Ｂ
「Nah, I just really felt that way just now.」
Marika
「Whaaat? That just makes me more embarrassed... I'll make some tasty food today, then! Just a minute～」


all
She rolls up her sleeves and heads toward the kitchen.
Honestly, she's wasted on me as a girlfriend... as a bride.
％Ｂ
「I know I said I'd protect her, but it feels like I'm the one being protected instead.」
I'll need to give it my all too.
