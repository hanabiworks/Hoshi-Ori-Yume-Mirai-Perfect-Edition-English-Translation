It's the beginning of December.
It's finally...
That's right, it's finally...
％Ｂ
「My firm's... open...」
It may be small, but it's mine without a doubt.
Mine and mine alone.
The door reads "％Ａ Architectural Firm."
The wallpaper's been redone.
The classy and stylish furniture's been arranged with meticulous care.
％Ｂ
「So this is where I work now...」
And at the same time, it's my castle.
I've become the lord of my own domain.
％Ｂ
「...All right!」
I clench my fist in anticipation and excitement.
Sora
「...」
Sora stares at me intently from my side.
％Ｂ
「Wh-What?」
Sora
「...Director.」
％Ｂ
「D-Director? You gotta at least call me Chief. It's an architectural firm.」

Sora
「...Chief, then.」
％Ｂ
「Uh... You know what, never mind. It's gonna make me feel weird until I get used to it.」
Sora
「...You won't get used to it if you don't hear it.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, that's true...」
Sora took the day off from work to come to the firm for the first day.

％Ｂ
「I don't really have a response ready for being called something like Director or Chief out of nowhere.」
％Ｂ
「You'd feel kinda weird too, right? Like if you were referred to as the director's wife as soon we get married or something.」

Sora
「...Director's wife...」
She goes red and starts fidgeting.
I guess she's not that against it...
％Ｂ
「Anyway... I'm not a chief or anything without any work to do. First, I need to secure myself some work.」

Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「How's the firm website stuff going?」
Sora
「...It's up as of today.」
all
Sora pulls up the firm's website on the computer.
％Ｂ
「Ohh... This is amazing. It's a nice design.」
I take a look at the website for the ％Ａ Architectural Firm that Sora made.
It's not too flashy, but it's not boring either.
It's classy and stylish.
％Ｂ
「I feel like I'll get people coming to me for commissions right away with this.」
Not that I have anything to back that thought up with.
Also, Azuma-san's kindly going to be outsourcing some work from the Azuma Architectural Firm to mine until I start getting a steady flow of customers of my own.


I really owe him everything.
Sora
「...Are you sure this is what you want to name the firm?」
％Ｂ
「Hm? Yeah... I thought about it a lot, but I thought I'd go with the safe option in the end.」

％Ｂ
「There's no point in having a flashy name since it's what's inside that counts. Plus, I want as many people as possible to know my name.」

Sora
「...I included a blog like you wanted, too. You can make posts here.」

％Ｂ
「Oh, thanks.」
Sora
「...But why did you want a blog?」
％Ｂ
「I was thinking of using it to write about my work and how projects are progressing.」
％Ｂ
「It's not like clients are gonna come every day to see how things are going, right? If I keep things updated on the blog, then they can check up on projects whenever they want.」


％Ｂ
「Though it'll probably just be like a personal diary at first.」
Sora
「...You put thought into this... I'm impressed.」
％Ｂ
「Guess so.」
I wonder when the day will come when I get to write a progress report into my blog.

all
％Ｂ
「Wha...? Who's that?」
Sora
「...Maybe someone saw the site and immediately came for a commission.」
％Ｂ
「Y-Yeah, right... That's way too quick...」
all
But, just maybe...
Sora opens the door.
Sora
「...Welcome.」
Azuma
「Yo. Congratulations on opening your new firm.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, it's just you, Teacher...」
Azuma
「Oh, come on. You're saying that after I came to personally congratulate you?」

％Ｂ
「I-I'm sorry... I thought it might be a commission, so I just...」
Azuma
「Honestly... Here. Flowers to celebrate.」
He holds out a small bouquet of flowers.
Azuma
「I was considering going big and sending you a big garland, but I figured that'd just take up space.」

％Ｂ
「Thank you very much! This is wonderful!」

Sora
「...Thanks, Mo-san.」
Sora accepts the flowers from him and starts getting a vase ready.
all
Azuma
「Hm... It's a nice, cosy-looking firm.」
He looks around the room.
Azuma
「It feels clean, and the furnishings look good. You won't give your clients any bad impressions this way. You've got a good eye for this.」


％Ｂ
「Y-Yes... Well...」
all
I glance at Sora.
Sora
「...Hmhmh.」
Oh, she looks smug...
all
Sora
「...Mo-san... Tea.」
Azuma
「Oh, thanks, Sora-chan. You quit your job at the planetarium to become his secretary or something?」

Sora
「...*shake shake*」
Sora
「...I'm just here because it's the opening day. Even if I were secretary, I don't think I'd get paid because there's no work.」

Azuma
「Yeah, that's true. Must be difficult having a boyfriend who isn't making any money.」
％Ｂ
「...I don't have any counterarguments...」
Azuma
「If you have a client show up on your first day, then that means you're ridiculously lucky. It took me more than a month to get my first client.」


If that's the case, then how long is it going to take me...?

Azuma
「Which is why, Sora-chan, your boyfriend is a very, very fortunate man.」

％Ｂ
「...What do you mean?」
Azuma
「Just a second.」
all
Azuma grabs his phone.
Azuma
「Hello? This is Azuma. Yes, hello. Yes... I'm already at the office... Yes... Would you like me to come out to get you, then?」


％Ｂ
「...What do you think he meant just now?」
Sora
「...*shake shake*」
all
Azuma
「Will you be okay? Around when will you... In about ten minutes? I understand. Please call me again if you are unable to find it. Yes... I look forward to seeing you, then.」


Azuma
「Now then. There's someone I want you to meet.」
He suddenly starts talking again after hanging up.
Azuma
「Or to be more precise, he's the one who said he wanted to meet you.」
％Ｂ
「...Who is it?」
Azuma
「You remember how you had a commission back at my firm from city hall a while ago?」
％Ｂ
「Do you mean the annex for city hall from two years ago? I completely lost the competition, though.」

Azuma
「It was a government building commission, after all. Your design was too freeform.」

Azuma
「But there was someone on the panel who really took a liking to that design of yours. He came by my firm the other day to commission a remodeling job.」


％Ｂ
「Uh huh...」
Azuma
「Asking for you.」
％Ｂ
「Wha... Me...?」
Sora
「...」
Azuma
「He apparently wants you to handle the remodeling design.」
％Ｂ
「Wha... But I've already resigned from the Azuma Architectural Firm.」
Azuma
「Yeah. And when I told him you became independent and set up your own firm, he asked me for your contact details.」

％Ｂ
「S-So then... that phone call just now was with...」
Azuma
「That's right. It was with that client. He's heading here now. I've owned my firm for a long time now, but this is the first time I've ever introduced a client who came to me to another firm.」


Azuma
「Though I guess it was a commission for "Hino," and not "Azuma."」

Azuma
「Though I guess it wasn't ever a commission for "Azuma" in the first place.」
Azuma
「Oh, looks like he's here. Sora-chan, could you open the door for him?」


％Ｂ
「B-Be polite to him, Sora!」
Sora
「...*nod*」
all
Sora
「...Welcome.」
Fukuzawa
「Hello. I'm pleased to make your acquaintance. My name is Fukuzawa. I was introduced to this firm by Azuma-san, the architect...」

Azuma
「Hello, Fukuzawa-san. You got here very quickly.」
Fukuzawa
「Oh, Azuma-san. Yes, it was easier to find than I had expected.」
Azuma
「I'll introduce you. This is the chief architect of this firm, Hino Ryousuke.」
Azuma
「I'll introduce you. This is the chief architect of this firm.」
Azuma
「And this is Fukuzawa-san, the client I was talking to you about.」
all
Fukuzawa
「Fukuzawa. It's very nice to meet you.」
％Ｂ
「L-Likewise! Welcome to the Azuma... I mean, ％Ａ Architectural Firm! I'm the chief architect, ％Ａ ％Ｂ!」

％Ｂ
「Thank you very much for coming all the way to the firm in person today!」

Fukuzawa
「Oh no, the pleasure is mine. I apologize for suddenly barging in when you're so busy.」

％Ｂ
「Oh, no... I'm very grateful! Um, anyway, please come this way.」
I lead Fukuzawa-san over to the guest seats and signal to Sora with a glance.
Sora
「...*nod*」
all
Sora immediately understands what I mean, and starts getting some tea ready.
Fukuzawa-san tells me the details of the job with Azuma-san also listening.

He wants to change the interior of his house into a barrier-free design and expand the house itself further out into the yard, because his grandparents are moving in with him.


It's more of a building addition than a remodeling.
all
Fukuzawa
「It's a shame about your proposal for the city hall annex back then. I myself immediately fell in love with Azuma-san's firm's design, but we were unable to use it due to it not matching our vision for a city hall.」


％Ｂ
「Oh no, that would be due to my own inexperience in the matter. I was unable to grasp the core concepts of a government building while planning out my design.」

Fukuzawa
「But, after seeing that design, I had decided that if I were to remodel my home I would definitely have to commission the Azuma Architectural Firm to do so.」


Fukuzawa
「I was surprised to hear that it was not Azuma-san himself, but a young staff member at his firm who had created the design... but I had become very much taken with that design regardless.」


Fukuzawa
「And so I asked the unreasonable of Azuma-san in order to request your services today.」

Fukuzawa
「I will give you full control over all aspects of the design. I would love you to use your specialty stars-and-sky-inspired designs to create an open, free-feeling home.」


％Ｂ
「I understand. I would love to accept this commission.」

％Ｂ
「But I would first like to see the blueprint and diagrams of your home. I will have to make calculations to determine how much we can add, according to the land coverage.」


Fukuzawa
「Azuma-san told me in advance that those would be necessary, and so I have them here with me. These are the documents.」

％Ｂ
「Please allow me to look through them.」
Azuma-san silently watches me talk with Fukuzawa-san.
It almost feels like I'm taking an exam, which probably isn't far from the truth.

all
％Ｂ
「─I understand. I will be visiting your home tomorrow, so let's talk while I take a look at the floor plan in person.」


Fukuzawa
「Yes. I very much look forward to working with you.」
％Ｂ
「I am still a novice, but I will be doing everything I possibly can to fulfill your expectations. Likewise, I look forward to working with you.」


We lower our heads to each other.
I see Azuma-san give a tiny nod as he watches us.
I assume that means I passed.
all
％Ｂ
「Hmm...」
I lay the blueprints and design diagrams I borrowed out on my desk and look through them after Azuma-san and Fukuzawa-san leave. 

Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「...Hm? What's up?」
Sora
「...I've never properly watched you working before.」
％Ｂ
「Really? What'd you think?」
Sora
「...You were very cool.」
％Ｂ
「Seriously?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
Sora
「...Enough to make me fall in love all over again.」
％Ｂ
「O-Oh... Thanks.」
I feel a little embarrassed at the somewhat reverent look I'm getting from her.
Sora
「Do you think it'll go well?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. I think I've got a lot of freedom, judging from these blueprints. A lot of people try to use as much of their plot as possible when they have a house built, but it doesn't look like that's the case for Fukuzawa-san.」


％Ｂ
「His parents apparently had it built with a pretty big yard because they wanted to give him plenty of space to grow up in as a child.」

％Ｂ
「It's a really kind house that was built with their children in mind.」

all
I lean back in my chair to take a bit of a break.
％Ｂ
「Still, though... Who'd have thought I'd get a commission on the first day...」

Now I know why Azuma-san said I was lucky.
Sora
「...Should be grateful to Mo-san.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah... Seriously.」
It's originally a commission that came to Azuma-san's firm.
Fukuzawa-san may have been interested in my design in particular, but Azuma-san wasn't under any obligation to send the job my way.

％Ｂ
「I'll call Teacher later to thank him again.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
Sora
「...Ryou...」
％Ｂ
「Hm?」
Sora
「Good luck.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. I've got this. I'm gonna do more and more work, and become the kind of architect who inspires others to be like him!」


That's right.
I need to hurry and become a first-rate architect, get my life in order...
And then I'll marry Sora.
That's my current goal.
