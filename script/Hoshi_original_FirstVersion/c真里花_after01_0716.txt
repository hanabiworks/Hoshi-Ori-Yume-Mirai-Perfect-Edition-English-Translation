「Okay. Now I just take this and...」
Firm Staff B
「Good mooorning... Oh?」

She looks surprised to see me when she comes in to work.

％Ｂ
「Oh, good morning.」
Firm Staff B
「You've been here really early lately.」
％Ｂ
「I've been the first one here these last few days. I've been wanting to get this done...」

Firm Staff B
「A model? I don't remember there being any jobs that need that right now.」
％Ｂ
「It's just something for the Oono residence.」
Firm Staff B
「Oh, the thing where you're going to have them compare between their plans and ours? You're even making a model?」


％Ｂ
「I was thinking of putting in a small camera so they could experience actually being inside both homes.」

Firm Staff B
「You're really doing a lot for this, aren't you, Hino-kun. Even though you have your exams to study for.」

Firm Staff B
「You're really doing a lot for this, aren't you. Even though you have your exams to study for.」

％Ｂ
「Oh no, I find this fun, so it's okay.」
I thought it'd be a lot of work at first...
But then I realized I was having fun building this model.
This really was where it all started for me.
And knowing that I'm giving form to another person's dreams makes me feel like it's really worth it.

％Ｂ
「And I'm making sure I don't neglect my other work.」
Firm Staff B
「You really are a hard worker. Make sure you don't keel over, okay?」

％Ｂ
「Of course!」
I'm busy, but unexpectedly enough, I don't feel too tired.
I guess it's just not that tiring to do what I love.

That, and I want Oono-san's wife to see this as soon as possible.
I want us all to find a place where she can be satisfied and happy.

I want to help her out.
％Ｂ
「Phew...」
It's past one o'clock.
Just a little after my usual lunch break.
I'm sitting on a bench by the seaside park, having myself a bit of a late lunch break.
I look around. I see a few people around the park.
Some people walking their dogs, and a few people taking late breaks.

Just like me.
Marika
「Thanks for waiting!」
％Ｂ
「Oh...」
I stand up on reflex when I see her running toward me.
Marika
「Hahh, hahh, hahh... A-Apologies for being late～」

％Ｂ
「You're panting way too hard! Y-You okay?」

Marika
「Y-Yep, I'm okay～ Ahaha... I might've rushed a little too much～」

％Ｂ
「Here, sit down and rest. Oh, I got some tea for you too. Want it? It's hot today.」


Marika
「Thank you～ ...I'll have some, then～」
She wearily sits down on the bench.
She quenches her thirst with the green tea.
Marika
「Hauh... Hahh... That calmed me down...」
％Ｂ
「You didn't need to rush so much.」
Marika
「B-But it's a lunchtime date... We only have an hour, so I wanted to be with you as long as possible... So...」


％Ｂ
「Mm... Thanks.」
Marika
「Ehehe...」
％Ｂ
「I'm glad I just happened to have the time for this.」
I'm supposed to meet with the Oonos today in the afternoon, so I left the firm a little earlier than usual for lunch.


This park's right by where Marika works.
It's also on the way to the Oono residence.
The opportunity was too good to pass up, so the two of us decided to spend lunch together.\n\r

I've brought a cutlet sandwich from a convenience store.
％Ｂ
「Wait, what? Didn't you bring any food, Marika?」

Marika's just got a small purse in hand.
I don't see anything that looks like a lunch.
Marika
「Oh, yeah, I already ate with the kids.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, right. Yeah, you guys have lunch with the kids.」
Marika
「Mhm. Lunchtime is work time too.」
Marika
「It's naptime right now, so we're all trading off taking afternoon breaks.」

％Ｂ
「Oh, really... I feel kinda bad being the only one eating. Was it okay for you to come here?」

Marika
「Oh, mhm, it's totally okay. You can feel free to eat without worrying.」

Marika
「And besides... I like watching people eat.」

％Ｂ
「D-Do you?」
Marika
「Yeah, so no need to be shy, okay?」
％Ｂ
「Then... I'll dig in.」
Marika
「Mhm, please do.」
I chomp into the cutlet sandwich.
Marika smiles and watches me eat.
Marika
「Hehe... This is kind of nice～ Usually I'm talking about stuff with the others in the breakroom about now.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, I guess that's all you've got to do if you're not eating.」
Marika
「That's right～ We always say we don't even get to enjoy our lunches that much.」

Marika
「You know, because we always have to keep an eye on the kids...」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, you just don't have the time to enjoy eating.」
Marika
「Exactly. A lot of the time I can't even remember what I had for lunch.」


％Ｂ
「Really? That's pretty rough...」
Getting to take my time eating lunch is a nice break for me...
But I guess even that's pretty hard for preschool teachers.
％Ｂ
「Oh, then do you want one? A cutlet sandwich might be a bit on the heavy side, but...」

Marika
「No, it looks really good. Are you sure?」

％Ｂ
「Oh yeah, go right ahead.」
Marika
「But I'd feel bad about taking a whole one. And I feel like I wouldn't be able to finish it either...」

Marika
「Can I have that half-eaten one?」
％Ｂ
「You're fine with this? Then here.」
Marika
「Nh... Amh, amh...」
I hold out the sandwich that I've already bit into.
She happily bites into it.
Marika
「It's good～ Hehe.」
Marika
「This kind of reminds me of back when we were students.」
％Ｂ
「Oh yeah, that takes me back.」
I remember we used to eat bread in the courtyard like this a lot.
We'd let each other have a few bites of our own food if there was something new out.
Marika
「Oh yeah, did you hear? Segawa-san's photo apparently won an award in a contest.」

％Ｂ
「That's the one that was on Facenote, right? She's amazing.」

％Ｂ
「And Okihara-senpai's apparently a professor's assistant at Kitazakura University. I got to see her for the first time in a while when she came in for something work-related the other day.」

Marika
「Wow, everyone's doing their best!」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. I can't afford to just sit around either...」
Marika
「Mmm... I think you're trying really hard, Ryousuke.」
Marika
「Mmm... I think you're trying really hard.」
％Ｂ
「You think so?」
Marika
「Mhm... Actually, I talk with the other teachers during break a lot... about our boyfriends and stuff...」


％Ｂ
「Uh... D-Do you now?」
Marika
「Yeah... Like how we got to know them, or memories with them, or how things are going...」

％Ｂ
「I-I see...」
Preschool teachers are still primarily female.
I wonder what her coworkers think of me...
Marika
「You have a really good reputation... They think you're a really nice and cool boyfriend, you know. Especially Katsura-sensei, she just heaps praise on you.」


Marika
「So when I talked to them about how I might see you today... they all said I should go right away. They said it's a woman's job to support her man, especially when he's busy with work.」


Marika
「I don't think I'm that good of a girlfriend, but...」
％Ｂ
「What are you talking about? You're a huge help.」
％Ｂ
「I know I already told you over LIME... but I got a huge hint from what you said the other day, didn't I?」

Marika
「You mean when I said... that lots of women won't understand unless they see something for themselves?」

％Ｂ
「Yeah. I'm going off of that to make a suggestion to them...」
all
I tell her the vague details of my work right now.
Marika
「But isn't it a lot of work to make a whole other model?」
％Ｂ
「It is... but things won't move forward otherwise. Whatever happens, I need them to be satisfied. I can't be shy about doing work if that's gonna happen.」


Marika
「...Hehe.」
％Ｂ
「What?」
Marika
「Nothing. I was just thinking about how cool my boyfriend is.」

％Ｂ
「W-Were you now?」
Marika
「Mhm.」
She's smiling happily.
I'm a little embarrassed... but seeing her smile at me like that fills me with energy.

all
％Ｂ
「Whoops... I need to get going.」
Before I know it, it's time for my lunch break to end.
Marika
「Oh, then, then... I have... a present for you, Ryousuke, since you're working hard the rest of the day.」

Marika
「Oh, then, then... I have... a present for you, since you're working hard the rest of the day.」

％Ｂ
「Huh? A present?」
What could it be?
Marika
「Here... Enjoy. It's dessert.」

％Ｂ
「Isn't this...?」
Marika holds something out to me.
It's a little pudding cup that says "Educational Pudding" on it.
Marika
「We had these for lunch today. I held onto my share... because I wanted you to have it.」

％Ｂ
「...You sure? You love pudding, Marika.」
Marika
「Ah, uuuh～ ...I was a little tempted～」
Marika
「But... I wanted it to be your present.」
％Ｂ
「Okay... Thanks.」
I grip the pudding cup tightly.
I feel like I can feel Marika's warmth through it.
％Ｂ
「I'm off!」
Marika
「Okay! Good luck!」
