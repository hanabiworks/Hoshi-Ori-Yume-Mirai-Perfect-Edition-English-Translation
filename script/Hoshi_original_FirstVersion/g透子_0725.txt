We're having our lunchbox party today.
We head back to the old school building a bit before lunch to get ready to welcome the others.

In the end, Touko wasn't able to make her own lunchbox.
I made a bit more to make up for it. We're going to say that my lunchbox is from the two of us.

Natsuki
「Hello theeere! You called, and I answered!」
％Ｂ
「Oh, you're the first one here, Segawa.」
Natsuki
「Of cooourse I am! Here's my offering.」

％Ｂ
「...Cheap snacks? This is your lunch?」
Natsuki
「Non, non. This is dessert. I figured the others would bring actual food, so I prepared something for after the meal.」


％Ｂ
「...Uh huh.」
Natsuki
「Can you believe how thoughtful I am!? I'm a girl who knows exactly what she's doing!」


Touko
「Mhm, nice choice, Camera-chan! I love these snacks!」

Natsuki
「Hmhmh, feel free to compliment me further!」
She may be acting smug, but I won't be fooled.
She just brought those to cover up for the fact that she can't cook.
Natsuki
「Wait a second, Touko! Why are you eating them already!? That's too soon!」

Touko
「Because I'm hungry. Here, Camera-chan. Have a bite.」

Natsuki
「Mh... Oh, that's good.」
She got won over in an instant.
The others better come quick, or else all the snacks are gonna be gone.
all
Sora
「...I'm hungry.」
％Ｂ
「Yo, Ousaka. Not beating around the bush, eh?」
Sora
「...I smelled something good.」
She brandishes a thumbs-up at me.
...I guess... she's trying to imply that she's growing and hungry...?
Natsuki
「I think it might be better for you to just not grow any more, Sora. It'd be a waste of your adorable little frame otherwise.」

Sora
「...I'm willing to take you to court for that statement, Natsu.」
Natsuki
「Why don't you ask for a guy's opinion? Since we just happen to have one here with us.」

％Ｂ
「What!? Wh-Why me!?」
Touko's eyes are probably gonna turn cold if I say yes.
I'll make Ousaka depressed if I say no.
Segawa clearly did this on purpose.
％Ｂ
「Oh, uh, well... Um...」
all
Marika
「Hellooo. Sorry we're late!」
Misa
「Rikka-san is also with us. We have all arrived.」
Rikka
「Um, Okihara-senpai... Could you let go of my hand now...?」
Misa
「Fufu, I think this is fine. You have very pretty hands, like an icefish.」

all
Natsuki
「...You got lucky.」

Marika
「Huh? What do you mean?」
％Ｂ
「N-Nothing! I'm hungry, so let's hurry and eat! Right, Ousaka!?」

all
Sora
「...*nod* Let's eat. I'm almost at my limit for bodily movement on an empty stomach.」

Misa
「Fufu, you're right. It would be terrible if you collapsed.」
You saved me, Shinozaki...
I'll let you eat as much of my food as you want.
all
Natsuki
「All right, everyone. Hands together now! Ready, go!」

％Ｂ & Sora & Marika & Natsuki & Misa & Rikka & Touko
「Let's eat!」
Segawa signals the start of our lunchbox party.
The variety of food from all of our lunches makes everything look way more extravagant than usual.

all
Sora
「...Misa, your lunch is amazing. Can I eat some?」
Misa
「Yes, of course. Please eat as much as you would like.」
all
Natsuki
「Your lunch is so pretty and tasty-looking, Rikka. Maybe that's your personality showing?」

Rikka
「D-Do you think so? I've never compared them with others', but this is normal, isn't it?」

all
Marika
「No, that's not true. I think the decorations and shapes are really pretty.」

Rikka
「You brought a cute lunch too, Shinozaki-san. It's very girly and nice.」

Marika
「Ehehe, you think so? Thank you, Narusawa-san.」
all
Natsuki
「Your lunch looks like what I'd expect a boy to eat. You score lots of points for making it yourself.」

Misa
「Yes, a man who can cook is wonderful.」
Sora
「...It's good. I can see how Tou's grown so much if she's been eating this every day.」

...You know she's only been eating my lunches for like a month, right?
My lunches aren't some ridiculous superfood for women.
all
Marika
「Th-That's not true, right...? Um, can I have some too...?」

Rikka
「...I'll give you a meatball, so I'm having some of that fried chicken.」
％Ｂ
「Aagh!? Wh-What the heck!? Even you, Segawa!?」
The three of them frantically snatch at my food.
I guess the never-ending troubles of women are ingrained pretty deeply into the psyche.
all
Touko
「Having big ones is rough too, you know. They're heavy and wear on the shoulders. Right, Jellyfish-senpai?」


Misa
「Um, having this conversation in front of a male audience is rather...」
Sora
「...Misa's boobs are heavy. And soft.」
Misa
「Kyah!? S-Sora-san!?」
Natsuki
「I'm touching tooo! I feel like it'd be like a good luck charm! Sora, let me take the right!」

Misa
「Kyaaah! N-Natsuki-san, you too...!? It tickles, please stop...!」

all
Marika
「...Narusawa-san... What are we going to do?」
Rikka
「Th-There's nothing for us to do in the first place. I wish they could at least be quiet while eating.」

Narusawa's attention is clearly on Okihara-senpai's chest though.
I guess Narusawa must be just like any other girl in that respect.

all
％Ｂ
「Hey, you guys are getting a bit too crazy! Just stop it already...!」
Natsuki
「This volume and softness you can feel even through her clothes and underwear...! Maybe fish contributes to boob growth too!?」


Sora
「...Misa's lunch has lots of fish. Your theory has support, Natsu.」

Rikka
「...I wonder if fillets are fine... Which is more effective between white and red fish meat...?」

Marika
「I think my mom said we were having fish for dinner tonight...! I have to check to make sure after this!」

I have absolutely no place in this conversation.
I kinda feel really awkward now that the girls' talk has started up... I don't really know what I should say...

all
Touko
「I hear protein is good for it, but I think sleeping lots is better. I know I sleep a lot.」

Misa
「Yes, they do say children who sleep often grow faster. Fish are certainly very nutritious, but I am doubtful as to whether they have an effect on bust size.」


all
Sora
「...I can't help being up late for stargazing. Stars or boobs... What a difficult choice.」

...Ousaka sure looks miserable.
And there's absolutely nothing I can say to comfort her.
Marika
「I'm sure it'll be fine, Ousaka-san. You're still growing.」
Sora
「...*nod* Let's do our best together, Ritsu.」

Rikka
「...Could you not include me in this?」
Sora
「You're the closest one to me here. You were looking at Misa's boobs so enviously.」

Rikka
「Hgh... N-No I wasn't! I was just worried about whether I'd be able to see the keys if they were that big...」


Oh, Narusawa. That's what people call fantasizing.
And there's absolutely nothing I can say to comfort her.
all
Natsuki
「It looks like we should be trying to win our battles with shape instead of volume... Your boobs were so pretty back when we saw them in the hot spring, Marika!」

Marika
「W-Wait, Segawa-san! Don't say that, it's embarrassing!」

Natsuki
「Girls get prettier from being looked at. Do you do something special?」

Marika
「I-I don't do anything... I mostly just massage them when I'm taking baths and stuff...」

I've learned today that Shinozaki rubs her own boobs in the bath.
And there's absolutely nothing I can... Okay, time to stop. Touko's glaring at me.
Sora
「...What do you do if you don't have enough to massage?」
Marika
「Being a girl isn't all about boobs. You're cute, so be confident, okay?」

Natsuki
「That's right! You have your small body and modest chest... Seeing you get embarrassed about what you're worried about gets me going!」


Sora
「...I don't need you getting aroused over me, Natsu.」
Touko
「I think I kinda get what Camera-chan means. She's kind of like a little fluffy animal.」

all
Marika
「Oh, I think I get that feeling from her too. She's like a nocturnal squirrel... maybe a flying squirrel?」

Touko
「What? Flying squirrels are nocturnal? You mean those cute things that glide through the air, right?」

Marika
「Mhm. Ousaka-san does stargazing, so she's kind of nocturnal, don't you think?」

Sora
「...There's no squirrel constellation. Shame.」
all
Rikka
「This teriyaki is delicious... Okihara-senpai, could you give me the recipe for this?」

Misa
「Of course I can. I will send you a message on LIME listing the seasonings I use.」

Rikka
「Thank you very much. It also seems very healthy, and good for your body.」

Misa
「...Excuse me, but why are you staring at my chest...?」

Conversations are just flying all around me.
Something about squirrels, then something about boobs... Leave it to a group of girls to be able to come up with this many things to talk about so quickly.

all
I appear to be included in this group, but I'm just eating in silence.
Ahh... These simmered vegetables turned out pretty good.
Natsuki
「Ahh... I'm full. Thanks for the meal!」
Misa
「This was very fun! We must do this again sometime!」

Sora
「...*nod* I'm happy I got to eat lots of good food.」
Marika
「Yeah. It's easy for us to put plans together during summer break, so let's do this again.」

Looks like the girls really enjoyed everything.
We lay out the snacks Segawa brought despite supposedly being full, and start relaxing.

all
％Ｂ
「How are Tanabata Festival preparations going for you guys? Moving along?」

Marika
「Oh, mhm. Senpai and I are having lots of fun.」
Misa
「Yes, so much fun. I often forget the passage of time while I chat with Marika-san.」

％Ｂ
「...Are you really making progress?」
Marika
「A-Ahaha... We might be a bit behind, actually.」
％Ｂ
「Would you like me to help? I think I can do a bit in the afternoons.」

Misa
「Let me see... I will discuss the matter with Marika-san afterward.」
all
％Ｂ
「What about you two? Gonna make it in time?」
Sora
「...The telescopes are nearly complete. I should make it in time with Ritsu's help.」

Rikka
「It was more work than I expected... I don't really do crafts that often.」
Sora
「But there is a bit of an issue. We need tripods with adjustable angling. Buying camera tripods... puts us over the budget.」

％Ｂ
「I see. Yeah, you can't hold a telescope steady with your hands. Segawa, you got any spares?」

Natsuki
「Not lots of them. I can lend you a few basic ones, but only two.」

％Ｂ
「Hmm, tripods... Oh, they apparently sell small ones at 100-yen shops. Could you use these?」

all
I looked it up on my phone and found that they sell small, toy-sized tripods at 100-yen shops.

They don't seem particularly durable, but they at least seem usable.
Sora
「I'll try going to the 100-yen shop in the marketplace.」
％Ｂ
「Sounds good. Let me know if you run into any more issues.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
all
Natsuki
「I like iiit! It really feels like you're all pumped for preparations! Looks like things are gonna get busy for me too!」

％Ｂ
「So you're taking photos like always, huh? You gonna be all right out in the sun?」
Natsuki
「Yeah, 'cause every club's working either indoors or in the shade. And I make sure to hydrate as I go.」

We're all doing what we can, the best we can.
It's just like Segawa says. It feels like the entire school's getting pumped for the Tanabata Festival.

all
％Ｂ
「Oh, it's time already?」
Misa
「Let's all have lunch together again.」
Natsuki
「I agree! I'll bring snacks with a bit more variety next time!」

all
Sora
「...I want to ask you something.」
It's been about five minutes since everyone left.
Ousaka was supposedly going to go continue the astronomy club's preparations, but she's come back.
％Ｂ
「What's up?」
Sora
「I was looking up things for the tripods for the telescopes... and it says they should be modified a little.」

all
Ousaka hands me her phone. The display shows a webpage detailing how to mod the tripods.\n\r

I skim through it to get the gist of the process.
％Ｂ
「...I see.」
Sora
「...I can't do this. I don't know if Ritsu can either, so I want your help.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, I should be able to manage this. Touko, can you handle things here for a while?」

Touko
「Mm, okay. I'll take a nap while I house-sit.」
all
【Misa】_st_0219
【Misa】「I'm very sorry, but may #Nwe ask for your #Nassistance?」
％Ｂ
「Hmm... Not the best timing. Didn't think I'd get asked for help by both groups at the same time.」

Touko
「What are you going to do? Have someone wait until tomorrow?」
％Ｂ
「...No. Could you go help out the naturalist club?」
Touko
「Whaaat!? Y-You want me to go, alone!?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. We can't say no to them since they don't have many people... And it's not like Shinozaki or Okihara-senpai are strangers to you, so it should be easy to work with them, right?」


Touko
「That might be true, but... Mmmh...! What do I do...!?」
％Ｂ
「Please, I need you to go. You're the only one I can count on.」
We don't have much time until the Tanabata Festival.
The naturalist club has one member and one helper, so their preparations are going to take a while as a matter of course.

It depends on what kind of help they need, of course, but I want to be able to help them at least a little.
I want Touko to help the naturalist club for Shinozaki and Okihara-senpai... as well as for her own sake.

Touko
「...Fiiine, I'll do it. I'll let them know I'm coming.」

She starts typing up a reply.
I'm sure she'll do a good job.
all
％Ｂ
「All right, let's go and get those supplies!」
Sora
「...*nod*」
all
％Ｂ
「Touko's taking a while...」
I'm sitting around with nothing to do after helping the astronomy club.\n \n\r
There aren't many students left working in the old school building, so maybe I should step out and go to the naturalist club for a bit...?

I sent her a LIME message about an hour ago, but she just replied with, "Still workiiing."

If they genuinely need more help, then I should probably go help too...
Touko
「I'm baaack...」
％Ｂ
「Oh, you're back... Wait, what happened?」
Touko
「It was horrible... Why were Flower-chan and Jellyfish-senpai so interested...? And it's all Camera-chan's fault for asking me so much...」


％Ｂ
「I'll ask just to make sure... but what happened?」
Touko
「...They put me through the wringer with questions about me and you.」



...I knew it.
It must've been an intense press conference with a torrent of shutter clicks if Segawa was there too.

Touko
「It's not like I was going to lie or anything, but um... there are things I can't talk about to other people, right? And those were the things they wanted to hear, so...」


％Ｂ
「...You didn't tell them everything, did you?」
Touko
「Not everything... Maybe 90 percent?」
That's pretty much everything!
I'm scared for my next encounter with Segawa!
Touko
「Come on, hurry and sit down!」
％Ｂ
「Wha? Hey, wait...!」
Touko
「Ahh... I can finally relax. I don't really feel right without this.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, 'cause everyone else was around for lunch today. Good work, Touko.」
We cuddle with each other to make up for not being able to during lunch.
I feel at peace just spoiling Touko like this at this point.

Touko
「...Hey, could you... teach me how to cook?」
％Ｂ
「Huh? Sure... but why so suddenly? Did the lunchbox party get you motivated?」

I don't really think there's any need for her to be so hard on herself... but if she wants to improve, then I want to be there for her.

Touko
「I want to make you tasty food too, you know. The lunch I made the other day wasn't really what I'd call a success, either.」


Touko
「So... could you teach me how to cook tomorrow and the day after?」
％Ｂ
「Sure. I'll help you, if you want me to. I wanna eat your cooking too.」

Touko
「Mhm! Ehehe, I'm so excited!」
％Ｂ
「Let's do our best. Don't give up halfway through, all right?」
Touko
「Don't worry, I'll try as hard as I can. I'll come over around lunchtime tomorrow, then. What are you going to teach me?」

％Ｂ
「I don't know off the top of my head... Well, what do you wanna make?」

Touko
「Mmm... An ultimate special meal that's easy to make! And something that can be made into a lunchbox!」

％Ｂ
「You can't be serious... Cooking is something you have to practice slow and steady.」

Touko
「Whaaat～? It's your job as the teacher to do something about that part, isn't it? We'll be able to eat tasty food together if I get better at cooking, so do your best, okay?」


％Ｂ
「...Why are you making it sound like you're the one in charge?」
