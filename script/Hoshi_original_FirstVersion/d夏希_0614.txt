It's a bright, sunny Saturday morning.
$$smh_OpenCHK
We're at Shionagi's beach.
We're going to catch some wildlife so the naturalist club can display them in their its marine zoo.
Okihara-senpai had already told Segawa and me yesterday that we'd be doing this today.

And of course, Shinozaki's here too, as the support member for the naturalist club.
But...
％Ｂ
「How'd the rest of you end up here...?」
Everyone who went camping with us was there when I arrived at the meet-up spot. And for some reason, even Shuuichi was there.

Sora
「...I got notice.」

Rikka
「I suddenly got a place and time sent to me over LIME.」
Misa
「I asked everyone to come because I believed it would be fun to do something all together, like when we went camping... But perhaps I should not have?」

％Ｂ
「Oh, no... I don't mind if you're okay with it, Senpai. I'm sure we'll get more done with more people too.」

all
Rikka
「I'm not an event club member, though.」
％Ｂ
「You wanna try helping us out while you're here?」
Rikka
「Why me?」
％Ｂ
「'Cause it's fun to do lots of stuff with others, right? Didn't you think it was fun when you came camping with us?」

Rikka
「...You're unexpectedly forceful
, Hino-kun

... You're almost like Segawa-san.」

％Ｂ
「Mmm... That doesn't really sound like a compliment.」
Shuuichi
「Now, now. It's like 
Ryousuke 
he 
just said. There's no downside to having more people.」

Shuuichi
「You're Narusawa-san, right? The event committee never turns anyone away, so you can just try things out for now.」

Rikka
「...I'll help for today, at least. Putting the issue of whether I'll join the event committee or not aside.」

Misa
「Thank you very much.」
all
％Ｂ
「...By the way, Shuuichi. You're helping the astronomy club, right? You sure you and Ousaka don't need to do any preparations for your stuff instead of coming here?」

Misa
「I could not help but also invite Sora-san, as she came camping with us.」

Shuuichi
「And I got a personal invitation from Okihara-senpai herself. She wanted me to participate, no matter what.」

A personal invitation?
Shuuichi
「I wasn't about to say no after hearing that, right?」
％Ｂ
「Sure, whatever. By the way, don't you have anything to do with Kaori-san, since it's the weekend?」

Shuuichi
「...We're... um... having a bit of a fight right now... She won't listen to anything I say...」
％Ｂ
「So you're saying that you're only here 'cause you've got nothing better to do. Should've just said so from the start.」
all
Misa
「Now then, everyone, let's begin collecting. Please be careful not to get hurt.」

Marika
「Okaaay.」
all
We all move out separately into the shallows.
％Ｂ
「All right, Segawa, we should get moving too...」
Wait, hold on. Now that I think about it, I haven't seen Segawa.
Is she not here???
Misa
「If you are looking for Natsuki-san, she has already begun taking photos.」
％Ｂ
「Wha...?」
all
_00cutinBS
Natsuki
「...」
Segawa's already far away from us.
She's pointing her camera at the water from the rocks, busying herself with photography.

_00cutinBS
Natsuki
「...」
_00cutinBS
％Ｂ
「When the heck did she...」
Misa
「She was very eager to ask me where one might find fish or likely habitats for coral as soon as we arrived.」

Misa
「I am so very grateful she appears to be taking my selfish request to photograph the animals within their natural habitat to heart.」


all
Natsuki
「...」
Segawa's the epitome of seriousness while she's at work.
It's almost like she's a different person from when she's not holding her camera.
all
Misa
「I could not possibly be any happier after seeing her so earnest in her work.」

all
％Ｂ
「...Can't lose to her now.」
Natsuki
「...」
％Ｂ
「How's it going?」
Natsuki
「Mmm... I've taken a good amount already. What do you think about these?」
all
I take a look at the camera's screen.
％Ｂ
「Holy―!?」
Natsuki
「Was that you trying to make a joke? 'Cause the coral's got holes?」
％Ｂ
「N-No, it wasn't! That was me yelling from surprise!」
all
Segawa's photo is just that amazing.
It shows off the silhouettes of the fish in the water and the vivid colors of the coral beautifully.

Misa
「May I also see?」
I show Okihara-senpai the screen as she draws closer.
Misa
「Oh my... Oh dear... Oh my, oh my...」
This response means she's really moved, right...?
Misa
「This is a very nice photo. You have depicted the wildlife as they are in nature, just as I asked. And this brilliant color... I can hardly believe you took this from above the surface of the water.」


％Ｂ
「That's great. Senpai loves it.」
Natsuki
「What can I say? I am the one who took it, after all.」
Misa
「How are you able to capture the colors so vividly when taking photos from above the surface?」

Natsuki
「It's because I'm using a polarizing filter.」
％Ｂ
「Polarizing filter?」
Natsuki
「You know how Sora wears those polarizing sunglasses every now and then, right? It's the same thing. It cuts down on the sunlight that reflects off the water, and lets you see clearly into the water.」


Misa
「I see... So that is how you did it. This is very good to know.」
％Ｂ
「I'm surprised you have a lens like that, though. Do all people who are into photography have one of those?」

Natsuki
「Hm? Mmm... Well... That's pretty much just how it goes for a cameraman.」
％Ｂ
「...?」
Natsuki
「Oh, Misa-san. Marika's calling for you over there. Maybe she caught something really big?」

Misa
「Yes, I am coming!」
％Ｂ
「Hey, Segawa.」
Natsuki
「Hm?」
％Ｂ
「Did you buy a polarizing filter just for today?」

Natsuki
「Huh? H-H-How'd you know?」
％Ｂ
「I just kinda had the feeling... and it looks like I was right. Lenses aren't cheap, right? You sure you're not overdoing it?」

Natsuki
「Polarizing lenses aren't that expensive, so it's fine.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, but still...」
Natsuki
「And I want to live up to Misa-san's expectations. Especially after she specifically asked for me to do this.」

Natsuki
「Besides, I was thinking of buying one for myself sometime anyway, so this was just a good opportunity for me.」

％Ｂ
「You really always go all out when it comes to photography, huh.」
Natsuki
「Of course I do. It's who I am.」
Natsuki
「Huh? Are they calling for you over there?」



％Ｂ
「For me? Uh, it's Okihara-senpai...? Wonder why.」
Misa
「I would like to begin taking the creatures we have been collecting back to school soon.」

％Ｂ
「Already? I think we could still keep going, though.」
Marika
「I think the fish might not be okay if they're stuck inside the containers for too long?」

％Ｂ
「Oh, that's true.」
all
Natsuki
「Okay, which means it's the guys' time to shine!」
Ryousuke・Shuuichi
％Ｂ
「Uh... Us...?」
Shuuichi
「Uh... Us...?」
％Ｂ・Shuuichi
％Ｂ
「Uh... Us...?」
Shuuichi
「Uh... Us...?」
all
％Ｂ
「Kuooooohhhhh!?」
Shuuichi
「Nfhhhhhhh!?」
％Ｂ
「It's... so heavyyyyyy...!?」
Carrying the animals back to the school was is more work than I thought it'd be.
It makes sense, since we have to keep the containers filled with seawater so the animals won't weaken.

all
Now I know why Senpai personally contacted Shuuichi and asked him to come.
She knew she'd need guys around to help...
I'd be dead if I had to do this all by myself!
Marika
「H-Hey... Do you want me to help?」
％Ｂ
「It-It's fine... This is easy... Ughhh...」
Shuuichi
「Hmph... H-How about you stop forcing yourself and switch...?」
％Ｂ
「S-Same for you... You can't go on anymore, right? Your legs are wobbling, man.」

Shuuichi
「R-Right back at you... Your face looks awfully pale...」
％Ｂ
「Kh... And I can see veins pulsing on yours...」
Shuuichi
「Your lips... are turning purple...」
％Ｂ
「The hell's that gotta do with anything...」
all
Marika
「Ahh, geez... Why do they always start competing like this...?」
Touko
「It's kinda funny watching boys act all stubborn at each other.」
Rikka
「You think so? I think it's just childish...」
all
Natsuki
「Mmm...」
Misa
「Natsuki-san? Is something the matter?」
Natsuki
「Hm? I'm just checking my photos～」
all
％Ｂ
「Kuoooohhhhh!?」
Shuuichi
「Nnfhhhhhh!?」
％Ｂ
「Hahh... Hahh... I-Is this fine...?」
Misa
「Yes. You two were a very big help. Thank you very much.」

Shuuichi
「Are you planning on displaying the tanks in this layout for the festival?」
Misa
「I would like the entire room to represent the actual ocean as closely as possible for the festival, so I would like to move the tanks somewhat. I will be relying on you two once again when the time comes.」


What a casual, horrific statement...
Shuuichi
「We'll probably have to adjust the lighting and stuff if you want to represent the ocean. I wonder if we'll have enough outlets. Maybe we'll have to get extension cords...?」


all
Touko
「Why don't you just route extension cords from the other chemistry classroom next door? I think there might be power strips or something in the storage room downstairs too.」



Shuuichi
「Oh... I'm impressed, Yukimura. How'd you know what's inside the old school building's storage room?」

Touko
「Uh... A-Ahaha... I just kiiinda got a feeling, you know...?」
％Ｂ
「Idiot...」
What's the point of making yourself look suspicious like that?
