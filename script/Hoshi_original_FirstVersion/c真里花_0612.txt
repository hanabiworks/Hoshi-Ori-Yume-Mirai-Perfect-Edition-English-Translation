「...Oh, it's time. We'll end it here, then. Make sure you review what we went over today.」


％Ｂ
「Zzz... Zzz...」
Rikka
「...?」
％Ｂ
「Zzz... Zzz...」
Rikka
「...Is he asleep?」
％Ｂ
「Zzz... Zzz...」
Rikka
「...Honestly.」
...Poke, poke.
％Ｂ
「...Hm?」
I wake up. Feels like something just poked me in the back.
％Ｂ
「...Wait. What time is it right now?」
Rikka
「It's lunch break.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, Narusawa, you woke me up? Sorry about that. I would've slept through lunch otherwise.」

Rikka
「You've looked tired all day.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. I stayed up a bit late. Fuaaaaaahh～～～～」

I was up late working last night too...
Rikka
「Is that... paint on your hands?」
％Ｂ
「Hm?」
all
I look. My fingertips have paint on them.
It's even under my nails.
Rikka
「Stayed up late painting again?」
％Ｂ
「Pretty much. There's someone I need to convince. I need to do at least this much.」


all
％Ｂ
「Whoops, I can't just be sitting here. I have to use lunch break to work on it.」

I wanna try to finish it either today or tomorrow, and go for a round two as soon as I can.

Natsuki
「Nooow then, lunch time～♪」
％Ｂ
「Oh! Great timing, Segawa! I need you to help me with this during lunch break.」

Natsuki
「What? But I'm about to go eat lunch right now.」
％Ｂ
「It's something you can do while eating. Please, could you help me?」

Natsuki
「Why's it always me～? Oh, I know! Rikka, you help too!」


Rikka
「Uh...」
Natsuki
「It's not like it'd ever hurt to have more people. You're free anyway, right Rikka?」

％Ｂ
「Come on now, you don't know that.」
Rikka
「...Okay.」
％Ｂ
「See? She's saying it's a... What?」
Rikka
「I'll help.」
％Ｂ
「Did you just... say you'll help?」
She nods.
Looks like I didn't mishear.
Natsuki
「Guess it was worth it to ask～」
Rikka
「I just have nothing to do, just like you said.」
％Ｂ
「But that'd be super helpful for me. So I can count on you, then?」

Rikka
「Yes.」
I've secured aid from an unexpected source.
I think I might be able to finish faster than expected at this rate.
Just you wait, Yukimura.
And so, after school...
Rikka
「So I just paint according to this design?」
％Ｂ
「That's right. I don't mind if you decide to change a few things along the way.」

Rikka
「Okay. I'll give it a try.」
She grabs a paintbrush and immediately starts painting.

Marika
「Wow... You're so good, Narusawa-san～」
She's being really casual about it, but her linework is beautiful.
％Ｂ
「You're right. Narusawa, are you good at art too?」
Rikka
「Not really. I've only ever done art during art class.」
Natsuki
「And you're this good? It's almost like you're trying to get under people's skin.」
Misa
「Rikka-san does have very nimble-looking hands.」
That's a good point.
It wouldn't be surprising for her to have excellent hand-eye coordination, considering how good she is at piano.

And if she grew up in a household that had her play piano since she was young, then I feel like it wouldn't be weird for that to lead to developing a general sense of aesthetics.

Rikka
「I'm just following the design.」
％Ｂ
「It's easier said than done, though. Either way, just keep going like that.」

Rikka
「I will.」
all
She nods, and then immediately immerses herself in the task at hand.
What impressive focus.
Sora
「...One hundred twelve stars... One hundred thirteen stars... One hundred fourteen stars...」
Though there's another one that's working silently on her own.
Ousaka's ability to focus is just as impressive when it comes to astronomy.
all
Marika
「I'm going to do my best too!」
Natsuki
「We can't let ourselves get left behind.」
Misa
「I'm sure we can finish it quickly if we all work together!」
The others are all getting passionate about their work, apparently inspired by Narusawa's concentration.
\n\r
Seems like her participation's affected everyone positively.

Touko
「Zzz... Zzz...」
％Ｂ
「Excuuuse me...」
％Ｂ
「All right, she's asleep. I'll just take this opportunity to...」

Touko
「Zzz... Zzz...」
Touko
「Mm...」
Touko
「...Huh? It felt like there was someone around... Maybe it was just me?」


Touko
「...Huh? What... is this?」
She pauses, looking surprised, and stares at what's before her.

There's a diagram of the stargazing aquarium put up across the entire hallway-side wall.
％Ｂ
「This is what we wanna do here.」
Touko
「Wha...?」
Yukimura looks surprised for a second time once she notices me.
Touko
「Did... you make this?」
％Ｂ
「It wasn't just me. I had everyone help out. It ended up being an all-nighter at the end...」

％Ｂ
「But this should be easier for you to understand with your frigid heart, right?」
Touko
「I already told you, I'm more on the sensitive side.」
Touko
「But... you made something like this, just to get me to see it?」

％Ｂ
「That's right. I really wanted you to understand.」
％Ｂ
「This is the kinda thing that we're trying to do. We don't want to use this place for something stupid.」

％Ｂ
「I wanted you to know that.」
Touko
「...This took a lot of time to make, didn't it?」
％Ｂ
「Huh? Well yeah, just look at how big it is. Though I had everyone help, so we really shrunk down how much time it took.」

I scanned the sketch into a computer, scaled it up, and divided that image up into multiple sheets of A4 paper to use as the design.

I had everyone look off of that design to paint it onto a huge piece of fabric.

Touko
「You're so stupid.」
％Ｂ
「Sorry about that. I couldn't think of any other way.」

％Ｂ
「It was a lot of work, but it was fun. It was really fun to make something with all the others. I'm sure that making this stargazing aquarium'll be fun too.」


Touko
「You're just so stupid.」
She sounds exasperated.
Touko
「But it might be fun to be stupid.」
Touko
「Hey. Can you really make this?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. For sure. As long as I've got everyone's help, and this place.」

％Ｂ
「So... Could you think about letting us use this place?」
Touko
「I told you. This place isn't mine.」
Touko
「You don't need my permission, so why don't you just use it? I'd like to see this stargazing aquarium too.」

％Ｂ
「Then you're saying...」
Did she just give us permission to use this building?
Yukimura's staring at the diagram on the wall.
She's smiling a bit.
Touko
「And I think it looks like a pretty comfy place.」
％Ｂ
「Of course. It'll be crazy comfy. I'll make sure it is.」


Touko
「Mhm. I'm looking forward to it.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah... Thanks, Yukimura.」
Touko
「Like I said. My permission doesn't matter, so you don't need to thank me. And it's not like I can say no after you've done all that.」

She then fixes her gaze on the painting on the wall again.
It was definitely worth all the effort to make this.
It's all thanks to the others.
I've gotta go tell them that it worked.
