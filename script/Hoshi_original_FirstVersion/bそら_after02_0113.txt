「...Zzz... Zzz...」
Sora
「...Ryou.」
％Ｂ
「...Zzz... Zzz...」
Sora
「...Ryou...!」
％Ｂ
「Nh... aah...?」
I wake up to find Sora's over.
％Ｂ
「Oh, Sora... Morning... Fuaaahhh... afh...」
Sora
「...*nod*」
The remodeling's on pause today because it's Coming of Age Day.
Which of course means I'm off too, so Sora and I are going to go out somewhere today.
％Ｂ
「My bad... Did I oversleep? What time's... Wait a second, it's still eight!??」

Sora
「...I have news.」
％Ｂ
「Hm? News? What is it?」
Sora
「...My "Tale of the Moon" is going to be used for the new show.」

％Ｂ
「Wha... Seriously!?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「Wow, that's great. Congratulations!」
Sora
「...It's thanks to your help, Ryou.」
Sora
「...It's thanks to your help.」
％Ｂ
「What are you talking about? You're the one who wrote it. I didn't do anything.」

Sora
「...*shake shake* It wouldn't have worked if it was just my plan.」
Sora
「"A visitor from the moon describes their homeland." Everyone unanimously agreed because it was an interesting idea.」

Sora
「So this is thanks to you. Thank you, Ryou.」
Sora
「So this is thanks to you. Thank you.」
％Ｂ
「Really... I'm glad I was helpful, then.」
It's a little embarrassing to have her thank me so straightforwardly.
％Ｂ
「Oh, by the way, what'd you go with for the visitor from the moon?」
Sora
「...A bunny...」
％Ｂ
「Ohh, you're gonna get a character costume?」
Sora
「I'm going to wear a twelve-layered kimono and put on bunny ears...」
％Ｂ
「Ohh...」
So I guess... the implication is that Princess Kaguya was a bunny?\n \n\r
Though the bunny ears are enough for the kids, and the adults'll understand the "Princess Kaguya was a bunny" idea, so it works.

I bet Sora herself wanted to wear the character costume, though.
％Ｂ
「Well, this is definitely something worth celebrating. We'll do it today on our date. We can switch plans to go to a bit of a nice restaurant and―」


Sora
「...*shake shake*」
Sora
「...Your job isn't done yet. And the show's only been greenlit. It hasn't been put on yet.」


Sora
「...Your job isn't done yet. And the show's only been greenlit. It hasn't been put on yet.」


％Ｂ
「That's true... but why not splurge every now and then?」
Sora
「...I want to celebrate for both of us together. Once my show's been put on, and your first job's complete. Celebrating two things will make us twice as happy.」


Sora
「...I want to celebrate for both of us together. Once my show's been put on, and your first job's complete. Celebrating two things will make us twice as happy.」


％Ｂ
「Well, if you say so...」
Sora
「Also more cost efficient.」
She sure has a good head on her shoulders... She's like a mother.
Even though I'm the older one here...
Sora
「...Now that that's been decided, hurry and get out of bed.」
％Ｂ
「Okay, okay.」
Sora
「...One okay.」
％Ｂ
「...Okay... I apologize.」
all
I haven't been on a date with Sora in a while.
Though all we're really doing is relaxing and doing shopping a bit nearby.
％Ｂ
「The hot springs is obviously out of the question today, but I wish we could go drive somewhere to see the stars again.」

Sora
「...*nod*」
Sora
「...But we haven't walked around together during the day like this in a while. We've only been able to see each other at night because you've been busy.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, that's true... Sorry I've had so much stuff to do.」
I had clear-cut off days back when I worked at the Azuma Architectural Firm, but the line's blurred somewhat now that I have my own firm.

Sora
「...No issues.」
She grips my hand.
Sora
「...Walking around town like this is enough to make me happy.」
％Ｂ
「Thanks. I'm happy too.」
I squeeze her little hand back.
Sora
「...*nod*」
Sora
「...Let's go.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah!」
all
％Ｂ
「Oh, it's Shio-wan.」
Sora
「...Shio-nyah too.」
We spot some nostalgic mascot characters in the marketplace.
It's Shionagi City's unofficial mascot characters, Shio-wan and Shio-nyah.

％Ｂ
「Now that takes me back.」
Wearing those costumes back in high school while we were working here's a good memory for me.

all
％Ｂ
「Wanna go take a look?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
all
We walk over to Shio-wan and Shio-nyah.
Grade-School Boy A
「Take this!」
Shio-wan
「...」
Shio-wan's being kicked around by kids just like always.
Poor thing...
Sora
「...Shio-nyah... So cute.」
Shio-nyah acts all embarrassed and falls over on the spot.

all
％Ｂ
「Haha, so she still has that character quirk... Man, this is so nostalgic.」
Sora
「...She didn't bend her knees right...」
Unrelenting criticism from the first Shio-nyah to a successor.
Shuuichi
「Huh? Ryousuke?」
Shuuichi
「Huh? Isn't that...?」
all
％Ｂ
「Hm? Oh, Shuuichi!」
I turn around to see Shuuichi standing there.
Shuuichi
「It's been forever! You too, Ousaka.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
It's seriously been a while since I've seen Shuuichi.
We both still live here in Shionagi, but we've had pretty much zero chances to get together in person since we started working.

We probably meet once, maybe twice a year.
％Ｂ
「How's work going?」
Shuuichi
「Same as always. I'm honestly getting bored because it's the same thing every day.」

I wonder why adults always immediately start talking about work once they run into someone they know... It's weird...

Shuuichi
「How about you? You doing a good job at that Teacher's place?」

％Ｂ
「Uhh... Actually, I resigned from Azuma-san's firm last October. I've got a small independent firm of my own now.」


Shuuichi
「Seriously!? You're independent now!? That's amazing!」
％Ｂ
「I'm nothing yet. I've only got one job I'm working on right now. You work for city hall, right? Send some public works stuff my way sometime.」


Shuuichi
「I can't do that! They'd put me behind bars!」
％Ｂ
「Ahaha, I'm kidding.」
I hand Shuuichi my business card while we chat.
Shuuichi
「Whoa, it's seriously a firm with your own name on it. You really just up and did it, huh?」
％Ｂ
「Pretty much.」
Shuuichi
「Hey, by the way, you two still aren't married yet, right...?」
He glances toward Sora as he asks.
％Ｂ
「Yeah, not yet.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
Shuuichi
「Really... Not yet, huh...」
...Kinda seems like he's trying to imply something with that response.
％Ｂ
「How about you? You're still with Kaori-san, right?」

Shuuichi
「Hm? Me? Mmm... Mmfufu.」
％Ｂ
「What's with that smug laugh...?」
Shuuichi
「I was planning on telling everyone through mail later... but I'm getting married!」

％Ｂ
「Wha... Seriously!?」
Sora
「...Ooh...」
％Ｂ
「Wh-When's the ceremony? You turn in the marriage registration already?」
Shuuichi
「We haven't decided on a date yet. We're planning on deciding sometime soon with her parents. I'll let you know once we decide.」


％Ｂ
「I-I see... So you're getting married...」
A friend I've known since grade school's getting married. 
It's kinda making me emotional...
Shuuichi
「Sorry to you two, but I'll be finding my happiness before you!」
Uh, we're already plenty happy here...
％Ｂ
「Either way, that's great. Congratulations, Shuuichi!」

Sora
「...Congratulations.」
Shuuichi
「Yeah, thanks!」
％Ｂ
「You better tell me once you know when the ceremony's gonna be. We'll be there for sure.」
Shuuichi
「Yeah, we'll make sure to invite you. You better come, no matter what!」
％Ｂ
「Of course I will. I'll drop everything and come running right away!」
Sora
「...*nod*, *nod*」
We can't help but smile when we see how happy Shuuichi looks.
...And one day, Sora and I'll do the same and...
