「Okay. This looks good.」
I'm done adjusting the positioning and height of the tripod holding the PCM recorder.

I had the broadcast club teach me how to record audio and lend me equipment so we could record Narusawa's performance.
This equipment is apparently high-quality stuff that they even use in professional work to do field recordings with.

They were real insistent that I be careful not to break it.
A legitimate recording studio would've been ideal, but we don't have access to anything like that, so we're in the music classroom like always.

Marika
「Now that I think about it, I think this might be the first time I'm hearing Narusawa-san's piano playing up close like this. I'm starting to get a little excited.」


Misa
「Yes. It feels similar to when one waits for a concert to begin.」
all
％Ｂ
「Segawa, no photos while we're recording, all right? The microphone'll pick up the shutter sounds.」

Natsuki
「Of course I know that.」
all
％Ｂ
「I think we'll start pretty soon. You ready, Narusawa?」

Rikka
「Yes. I'm fine whenever.」
％Ｂ
「You don't have to start playing right away once we start recording. You can go on your own timing.」

Rikka
「...」
She doesn't respond.
It looks like she's already fully focused on the piano.
She does indeed seem to be completely ready.
all
I press the record button, and walk as quietly as I can toward the audience.

Narusawa slides her fingers onto the keys a moment after I come to a stop.

It's a familiar melody...
But it sounds completely different from what I know.

％Ｂ
「...」
I can't move a muscle.
It's like I've even forgotten to breathe.
I think I finally understand what it means to have your breath taken away by music.

Marika
「...」
Natsuki
「...」
Sora
「...」
Misa
「...」
Touko
「...」
And the others are also listening to Narusawa's performance in the same way.

It's not that we're not speaking.
It's that we can't.
This is a small concert hall now.
This is a live performance...
A bottomless, infinite sound expands, deepens, and stretches...\n\r
Even the sound of the pedals moving is a part of the performance...
Everything blends together into an awe-inspiring harmony.
It's a world of Narusawa's creation.
Rikka
「...」
She silently lifts her fingers from the keys.
For an instant, I don't recognize that as a signal that she's finished.
Eventually, the sound of applause cuts through the silence.
all
Marika
「Woooow! That was so amazing! It sounded so pretty!」

Sora
「I saw stars.」
all
Misa
「I also could imagine a sky filled with stars, shining above the silent waves of the nighttime sea!」

Touko
「You really are Piano-chan, Piano-chan.」
Natsuki
「I regret not being able to take any photos, but I captured it perfectly in the film of my heart!」

all
I press the stop button on the PCM recorder to stop the recording.
％Ｂ
「Great work. I think it was a really good performance.」
Rikka
「Thank you. But if it really was, then it was all thanks to you.」
Rikka
「I was able to perform like that because you sang for me yesterday.」

％Ｂ
「Ahh～ ...Would it be possible for you to forget that off-key singing?」

Rikka
「I won't forget. Not for as long as I live.」
I can't help but smile when she smiles.
Sora
「Staaare～...」
all
％Ｂ
「...Huh? Oh...!」
Rikka
「...!」
I turn around to see Segawa and the others watching us warmly.

Natsuki
「Mind if we try talking to you guys now?」
％Ｂ
「G-Go ahead... I mean, you could've said something whenever you wanted.」
Marika
「It kind of wasn't the kind of mood we could do that in... There was a really nice atmosphere...」

all
Touko
「We didn't want to get in the way, Piano-chan.」
Rikka
「What? M-Me...?」
Usually that would be addressed to me, but this time it's to Narusawa.
Yukimura's got an impish "got you" smile on her face.
all
Rikka
「...I-I don't care. There's nothing to even get in the way of in the first place.」
She's trying to act as calm and composed as ever, but she's clearly flustered.

Rikka
「Uuuh...」
She makes this cute, lost-sounding moan. Her eyes beg me for a lifeline.

all
％Ｂ
「Uhh, by the way, did you have something to say?」
Natsuki
「I was wondering what we're gonna do with this now. We're not gonna just play back the recording just like that, are we?」

％Ｂ
「I've talked to some people in the broadcast club about the editing stuff too. I'm gonna ask them to do it for us once I go to return the equipment.」

all
％Ｂ
「I know. Narusawa, could you help me carry the stuff?」
Rikka
「O-Okay. I can.」
Touko
「It's just the recorder and a tripod, though.」
all
Natsuki
「...They're trying to escape.」
Narusawa and I ignore the commentary and leave the music classroom.
