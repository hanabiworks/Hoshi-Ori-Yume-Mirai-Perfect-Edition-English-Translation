Shuuichi
「First off, good job getting through exams! Things are going to get busy from now until the Tanabata Festival!」


％Ｂ
「Hey, Shinozaki. What was the Tanabata Festival like for event committee members last year?」

Marika
「I don't really know any details either, but it looked like a lot of work. I saw lots of burnt-out people after it was all over.」

Shuuichi
「There better not be anyone who's in danger of failing any exams here! If anyone here can't participate in committee work because of supplementary lessons, then we're going to shame you in lots of different ways!」


...Scary.
It's like an athletic rally or something...

Shuuichi
「You hear me
, Ryousuke

!? I'm talking to you!」
％Ｂ
「Why are you singling me out!? You're the one who better not have gotten a zero 'cause you forgot to write your name in again!」

Shuuichi
「Th-That was just because I forgot! It's fine since I have the actual ability to solve the problems!」

％Ｂ
「I don't need your excuses! A zero's a zero!」
Shuuichi
「You're the one who got a 6 once because you misaligned the answer sheet from the problems by one! And it was on an exam where the average score was over 70!」

Marika
「St-Stop it already, you two! They're both embarrassing, so let's just say that's enough, okay?」


Shuuichi
「...Right.」
％Ｂ
「...Sounds good.」
We both stop arguing at Shinozaki's behest.
You got lucky this time, Shuuichi.
all
Shuuichi
「Right, I have something to give you. Here, take this.」
％Ｂ
「What's this?」
Shuuichi
「It's the key to the old school building. I'm letting you take care of this, so you better not lose it. Someone apparently lost the one before that one a long time ago.」

％Ｂ
「H-Huh, really.」
That's the one Touko's got, isn't it...?
This key's got a completely different design from hers. It was clearly made at a later point.

Shuuichi
「The old school building's been okayed for use on the condition that only certain parts of it are used. I'm putting you and Yukimura in charge of this, so do your best.」

％Ｂ
「...Yeah, got it. You can count on me.」
all
％Ｂ
「Ah, that's right. Shinozaki, have you seen Touko anywhere?」
Marika
「Huh? I haven't seen her... Why?」
％Ｂ
「She apparently overslept this morning, so we didn't walk to school together. I haven't seen her after that either... so I was just wondering if you knew where she went.」

Marika
「I haven't seen her today either. Have you tried contacting her?」
％Ｂ
「...Touko seriously only ever responds if she feels like it. It's a real pain.」

Marika
「A-Ahahaha... There isn't much point to her having a cell phone then, is there?」
Shuuichi
「What are you two doing? We're busy, so I need you two to hurry up and get to work.」

％Ｂ
「Shuuichi, you seen Touko? I haven't seen her all day.」
Shuuichi
「Why would we know where she is if you don't? You're the biggest Yukimura freak in all of Shionagi.」

Marika
「...I think that's a dirty way of saying it～」
Shuuichi
「Why don't you ask someone in her class? Wait a second, I'll go ask someone in class E.」

all
Shuuichi came back with no particularly interesting information.\n \n\r
It was apparently the same as usual with her today, where she'd just suddenly disappear and reappear from her seat throughout the day.

％Ｂ
「...She's not picking up. Guess I'll at least send a message.」
_smh_st_04
She should be at school today.
I'm sure she'll wander over to the old school building at some point if I let her know I'm there.
【％Ｂ】「I'll be waiting in the #Nold school building.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, it's locked...」
Which means Touko isn't here.
I pull out the key I just got from Shuuichi from my pocket and unlock the door.

％Ｂ
「Hup... What the...! Dammit, it's not turning...!」
Touko always makes it look so easy...!
Is there a trick or something to this!? It's actually pretty hard...!
％Ｂ
「Kh... you piece of...! Just open already...!」
％Ｂ
「All right, it's finally open...!」
Guess I should learn from Touko how to unlock that door sometime...
％Ｂ
「I know. I'll ask Segawa.」
Segawa might've seen her, since she's always moving all around the school.
I might as well take the chance to ask everyone.
【％Ｂ】「Have any of you guys #Nseen Touko? I haven't #Nseen her all day.」
【Marika】「She isn't in the old #Nschool building either?」
【％Ｂ】「I just got here, but no #None's here.」
【Rikka】「She hasn't come to the #Nmusic room.」
【Natsuki】「I haven't seen her #Neither.」
【Misa】「I also have not caught #Nsight of her.」
【Natsuki】「I'm sure Touko's got #Ntimes when she wants to #Nbe alone too.」
【Sora】「Saw her from the roof. #NThink she went home #Nalready.」
％Ｂ
「...What?」
Went home already...?
She didn't tell me anything about that...
【％Ｂ】「Thanks. I'm gonna try #Ncontacting her again.」
％Ｂ
「...She's not avoiding me, is she?」
I can't think of any reason why.
Did something happen that I don't know about?
Female Student C
「Excuse meee, I'd like to ask you something about the materials. Could you come with me?」

％Ｂ
「...」
Female Student C
「...Excuse me? Can you hear me?」
％Ｂ
「Huh? O-Oh... Sorry about that. I'll come right away.」
I have event committee work to do.
I'll think about Touko later.
％Ｂ
「...I'm no good today.」
I can't focus on my work at all because I'm worried about Touko.
I'm astonished at how pitiful I am.
％Ｂ
「I guess I'll go home for today... I'll try contacting her again at night.」
Touko isn't picking up, as usual.
I throw my phone aside and roll on my bed.
％Ｂ
「...」
It's only been one day... but I haven't gotten to see her face or hear her voice for today.

There have been days like this since we started hanging out together... but it never felt this lonely before.

This doubt, loneliness, and frustration.
All this pain... must be another facet of being in love.

％Ｂ
「...I wanna see her.」
