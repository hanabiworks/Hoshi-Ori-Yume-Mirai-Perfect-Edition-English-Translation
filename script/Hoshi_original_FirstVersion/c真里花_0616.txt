Natsuki
「Fish are pretty nice～」
She clicks the shutter while aiming at the fish tanks.
She looks incredibly relaxed.
all
Sora
「...Soothing.」

Rikka
「I didn't think they'd be too cute since it isn't like you can communicate with them, but they're actually not that bad.」

Narusawa's delicately feeding the fish.
The fish gather at the water's surface for the food.
all
Touko
「Mmm... It's kind of a nice mood. It's not a bad place to be.」

Marika
「The fact that we're all gathered here is proof that it's a nice place to be, isn't it?」

％Ｂ
「I'd say so.」
all
The fish tanks may contribute to it, but I really do think this old school building has a unique sort of atmosphere to it.

The kind that gets people to relax.
Natsuki
「But it's still a bit sparse. Let's go catch lots more fish! I'll be on the front lines this time!」


％Ｂ
「Oh, I like that look in your eyes.」
Natsuki
「They're the eyes of a fisher... No, the eyes of a hunter!」
Misa
「I would certainly like to do so as well... but there is the issue of the tanks.」

all
That's right.
We had shelved that issue previously.
Misa
「I can get a few more from some people I know, but we still just do not have enough.」

％Ｂ
「Is that so... if we were to buy them... they'd be very expensive, right?」

Misa
「Yes, decently so. I have a catalog over here.」

％Ｂ
「Ack... Th-That's real pricey.」
I'm seeing five-digit numbers.

Natsuki
「Can't we just make tanks ourselves?」
She says it pretty nonchalantly.
Make water tanks ourselves?
Misa
「What? Make... tanks? I've never considered it...」

％Ｂ
「...Actually, we might be able to.」
all
I've thought of something.
We might be able to make some tanks ourselves.
Touko
「We can make them? Fish tanks? Really?」
％Ｂ
「Maybe. Okihara-senpai, what are fish tanks made from?」

all
Misa
「Mostly glass, acrylic, or plastic. Glass is preferable for its transparency. Acrylic would be the best in general, but that would be quite expensive.」


％Ｂ
「Is the glass used for water tanks something special? Or is it just normal glass?」

Misa
「...I'm very sorry. I do not know as to the specific type of glass used.」

Misa
「I'll go find out, so please give me some time!」
all
She leaves the classroom.
Considering how she was taking out her phone as she went, she might be leaving to go call someone to ask about it.

Rikka
「...So what if it turns out to be just normal glass?」
％Ｂ
「Then we might be able to make it ourselves, right?」
Rikka
「...Can we do that?」
all
Okihara-senpai comes back right away while we're talking.
Misa
「It appears there is no difference! Glass tanks use the same variety of glass as typical windows.」


Misa
「It appears that for a 90- to 110-liter tank, glass of about 6 to 8 millimeters in thickness is standard.」

％Ｂ
「Really? Then I think it's doable...」
all
Touko
「What are you planning on doing?」
％Ｂ
「We're gonna use the windows in this building.」
Marika
「Huh? In this building?」
Touko
「...Oh, right.」
It looks like Yukimura, the one who's most familiar with this building, has already realized what I'm getting at.
％Ｂ
「This place is supposed to be torn down next year, right? They usually start removing windows early on.」

all
Touko
「Yeah. This side's still okay, but there's lots of those on the east side.」
all
Sora
「I've seen it from the roof. They do construction work sometimes.」
Natsuki
「So we're going to build them with that glass? Is it gonna be that easy?」

Rikka
「...It looks like there are some people that make tanks themselves on the internet.」
all
Narusawa's got her smartphone in hand.
She must've looked it up.
Looking at the site she pulled up, there's a list of necessary materials and tools, and even step-by-step instructions.

Okay. I think we can work with this.
all
Marika
「You might be able to do it
, Hino-kun

. You're really good with your hands.」

％Ｂ
「Well, I guess. I've got some experience with construction stuff, so I think it'll be doable.」

It might be different from making architectural models, but I'm sure there are some similarities too.\n\r

I bet this'll be a good experience in general as well.

Touko
「Why not? They were just going to throw those away anyway, right?」
Marika
「Yeah! Let's try it!」
Natsuki
「I like it～ I like the looks on your faces. Things are starting to get exciting.」

all
Looks like we're about to get busy!
