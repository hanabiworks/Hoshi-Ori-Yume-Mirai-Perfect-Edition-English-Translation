We've switched locations from the seaside park to the campground.

We can clearly see the dimmer stars that we couldn't at the park now that we're this far away from the city lights.

Natsuki's standing next to me, smiling cheerfully up at the stars.
And to her side is her camera, mounted on the equatorial mount.
Natsuki
「Hmh, hmhmmmh～ I think it's almost time～」
She hums as she looks at the camera.
She's in a good mood because of what happened yesterday.
Natsuki
「What do you think? If they're not good, then be honest, okay?」
We got the photos we took using the equatorial mount on Sunday night developed...
And had Ousaka look at them right away.
They looked like proper photos of the stars to us.
But Ousaka's opinion is most important, as the client.
Natsuki watched for her reaction, a serious look on her face.
Sora
「...」
And Ousaka stared intently at Natsuki's photos with a serious expression.
Natsuki
「What do you think... Not good? Still not great? Terrible?」
％Ｂ
「What do you think, Ousaka?」
Sora
「Rukbat, Arkab, Alnasl, Kaus...」
Natsuki
「...?」
Sora
「Media, Kaus Australis, Kaus Borealis, Nunki, Ascella... I can clearly see all of the stars that make up Sagittarius.」


％Ｂ
「Which means?」
Sora
「...Perfect.」
She gives a thumbs-up with gusto.

Natsuki
「That's Vulpecula dooone! What's next?」
％Ｂ
「Next up's... Sagitta.」
Natsuki
「Wha? Didn't we already do that one?」
％Ｂ
「No, Sagitta. Not Sagittarius. It's the arrow constellation.」
Natsuki
「There's an arrow constellation? People sure were creative when they came up with this stuff.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, they must've had really active imaginations. I feel like you wouldn't be able to make people or animals by connecting together stars otherwise.」


Natsuki
「And there's a harp and a shield and an arrow too. Anything goes, I guess. So where's the arrow?」


％Ｂ
「It's right under Vulpecula. You know where Altair is, right? It's one of the ones in the Summer Triangle that Ousaka showed us before.」

Natsuki
「Yeah, I know where it is.」
％Ｂ
「Sagitta's a little above it.」
Natsuki
「...Okay, this is good. Start the equatorial mount.」
％Ｂ
「Sure thing.」
Natsuki
「Okay. Phew...」
％Ｂ
「Tired? How about we take a bit of a break?」
Natsuki
「No, I'm fine.」
％Ｂ
「Want some coffee? I've got black tea too. And oolong tea and sports drinks. No ice, though.」


Natsuki
「You sure came prepared.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, 'cause I knew we'd be here for a while today. I've got snacks too. Want some super-spicy rice crackers?」

Natsuki
「You're kidding!?」
％Ｂ
「I am. It's actually just chips and chocolate and stuff. I brought a picnic blanket too, so let me know if you ever wanna lie down.」


Natsuki
「It's kinda like we really came to camp. I'm kinda getting excited.」

％Ｂ
「Wanna start a campfire or something?」
Natsuki
「Nope, we can't. We won't be able to get shots of the stars that way.」
％Ｂ
「That's true.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, speaking of, Shinozaki and the others were saying we should all go hang out somewhere again after the Tanabata Festival. Same group as last time.」


Natsuki
「That sounds nice. I'm looking forward to it!」
％Ｂ
「And the two of us should go out places together too.」
Natsuki
「Mhm, I was thinking the same thing. Let's have lots of fun together.」
％Ｂ
「But you're planning on taking tons of pictures wherever we go, right?」
Natsuki
「Of course. I wouldn't be me if I didn't take any pictures, right?」

％Ｂ
「Hahaha, fair enough.」
Natsuki
「Ahaha!」
all
Natsuki looks up at the sky as she laughs.
Natsuki
「Oh... A shooting star!」
％Ｂ
「Oh... Wait, I didn't get to see it.」
Natsuki
「It was around there! Next to that one in the Summer Triangle... Denim! It moved right past it!」

％Ｂ
「Deneb, not Denim. I think it's around the time of year for the Perseids, so it's probably part of that.」


Natsuki
「Huh? What's that?」
％Ｂ
「They're one of the three biggest meteor showers. You see them a lot from July until the end of August.」

Natsuki
「The three biggest meteor showers? What are the other two?」
％Ｂ
「The Quarantids and... the Geminids.」
Natsuki
「You sure know a lot.」
％Ｂ
「No, I don't really know if I'm right. I just kinda remember them saying something along those lines at a stargazing party I went to a long time ago.」


％Ｂ
「Anyway, what matters is that now's the time of year you can see shooting stars.」
Natsuki
「Hmm... Don't people say that if you make a wish on a shooting star three times before it disappears, it'll come true?」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, they do.」
Natsuki
「But that's definitely impossible, when you think about it. Shooting stars disappear in an instant.」

Natsuki
「You see one, you go, "Oh! A shooting star!", and then it's over.」

％Ｂ
「Don't be such a dream crusher...」
Natsuki
「I wouldn't say things like this if there was anyone who managed to pull it off. But I think there's no way anyone's done it. No way!」

％Ｂ
「But what if someone wanted just money. Don't you think you could just go "moneymoneymoney" as soon as they saw a shooting star?」


Natsuki
「Who's the bigger dream crusher between you and me at this point?」
％Ｂ
「...Fair enough.」
Imagining wishing on a shooting star for money is the kinda thing that just obliterates dreams.
％Ｂ
「My bad.」
Natsuki
「Mm, as long as you understand.」
％Ｂ
「But man, it'd be great if we could see shooting stars all the time. It'd be so easy to make a wish that way.」

Natsuki
「But then you'd start taking them for granted. Okay, let's close the shutter soon―」

She cuts herself off and stares up at the sky.
％Ｂ
「What's up? You see another shooting star?」
Natsuki
「...If we could see shooting stars all the time...」
％Ｂ
「Natsuki...?」
Natsuki
「...
Ryousuke... 

I think... I might've figured out a photo I want to try taking...」
％Ｂ
「Huh? ...A photo you wanna try taking?」
Natsuki
「Oh... B-But finishing Sora's request is the higher priority right now. I can do things for myself later...」

Natsuki
「Sagitta, done! What's next?」
％Ｂ
「Let's see... The dolphin one's next. Delphinus.」
Natsuki
「What? There's a dolphin too? Man, people really were imaginative a long time ago.」

％Ｂ
「There are four stars making a small diamond to the bottom left of Sagitta. That's Delphinus.」

Natsuki
「Oh my god... That's so cute! That group of stars is crazy cute!」

Ah. So this is how the constellations were made.
％Ｂ
「You take a liking to that one?」
Natsuki
「Yeah! I'm gonna get them to reprint one for me when I get these developed!」
What happened to doing things for yourself later...?
