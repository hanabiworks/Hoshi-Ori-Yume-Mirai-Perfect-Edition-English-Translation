「Fuaaahhh... Afhh... Aghh... So tired...」
I went to sleep as soon as I got home last night too...
Natsuki
「What's uuuup! Morniiing～♪」
％Ｂ
「...Hey... You're pretty energetic even though it's morning...」
Natsuki
「You're so dumb. I'm energetic because it's morning!」
％Ｂ
「Is that how it works? ...Fuaah... afhh...」
Natsuki
「Yesterday was so much fun! The curry was great, and the hot springs felt amazing. And we even got closer with everyone there! What a success!」


％Ｂ
「What do you mean, "even"? That's the main reason we went...」
Natsuki
「Who cares? All that matters is that we accomplished our goals. You don't need to fuss over every little thing.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, you're right.」
Natsuki
「And it's all thanks to me for putting it together. You can start with the praise now.」

％Ｂ
「...You're right that you're the one who brought it up in the first place, so I really do appreciate that.」
Natsuki
「You're being so roundabout! Things got fun because I was there, right? With the game and stuff.」


％Ｂ
「Yeah, now I remember... My butt's been a horrible mess all morning thanks to those super-spicy rice crackers...」

Natsuki
「Yeah, you ate the entire bag yourself. The way you committed to it like that was very manly and cool.」


％Ｂ
「Weird... I'm being complimented, but I just don't feel happy about it...」
Natsuki
「Oh, by the way, I printed out the photos from yesterday.」
％Ｂ
「That was fast.」
Natsuki
「'Cause I was using a digital camera. You can do it in a flash if you just take the SD card to one of the printing machines at the store. I'll hand them out to everyone later, so help out.」


％Ｂ
「Sure, I don't mind.」
Natsuki
「I'll give Rikka hers when I see her. Let's go hand out the others' during lunch.」

％Ｂ
「Got it.」
Natsuki
「And don't worry. If you're wondering about the photos of you crying while you ate all of those rice crackers, I printed out enough for everyone.」

％Ｂ
「...How is that supposed to be reassuring to me...?」
Narusawa's already sitting in her seat when we walk in.
Natsuki
「Oh, Rikka's already here!」
Rikka
「What...?」
Natsuki
「Morniiing! Yesterday was fun, wasn't it!?」
Rikka
「...You're awfully energetic, even though it's morning.」
Natsuki
「I'm energetic because it's morning!」
％Ｂ
「There she goes again...」
Rikka
「...I'm jealous. I have low blood pressure, so I don't have the energy to yell in the mornings like you do.」


Natsuki
「Are you eating properly? You're already on the thin side, so you need to make sure you eat enough meat and fish and stuff. Your boobs won't get big like Misa-san's otherwise.」


Rikka
「Wh-What are you talking about...!?」
...Let's not comment.
Or more like, I need to pretend I don't know anything about that...
Rikka
「Geez. If there's nothing you need from me, then be quiet.」
Natsuki
「I do have something for you. Here. These are the photos from yesterday.」
Rikka
「Wha...? I already have my own photos, so it's fine.」
Natsuki
「But you don't have any of yourself, right?」
Rikka
「Myself...?」
Natsuki
「I made sure to get everyone in my photos! And with 30 percent more beauty, to boot! Here, take a look!」

Narusawa looks at the photos once Segawa shoves them in her face.
Rikka
「...Huh...」
Natsuki
「What do you think? They came out great, right? It's so weird how photos just tend to come out better in general when the subject's nice.」

Rikka
「...Subject and such aside... These really are good photos.」

Natsuki
「Right? Riiight?」
Narusawa's honestly impressed with Segawa's photos.
Rikka
「...About how much do I owe you for printing them?」
Natsuki
「Wha? You don't owe me anything.」
Rikka
「I can't not pay you for them. There's a lot of them. And besides, I never paid anything for the food yesterday either.」

Natsuki
「You don't need to worry about that. Right
, Hino

?」
％Ｂ
「R-Right. I wasn't planning on making you pay either.」
Rikka
「But I shouldn't be allowed to participate for free.」
％Ｂ
「Don't worry about it. I was just happy that you came along.」

Rikka
「Wha...?」
％Ｂ
「If you really wanna pay, then why don't you just pay for Segawa's printing fees?」

Natsuki
「I'm not going to take any money from you either though. I can't take money from a friend.」

Rikka
「...A friend...」
％Ｂ
「Well, that's apparently how it is, so why don't you just accept them?」

Rikka
「...Fine. I'll take them, then. Thank you, Segawa-san.」
Natsuki
「It's fine, don't mention it. I'll be taking photos of you again in exchange, so thanks in advance.」

all
Natsuki
「Let's get going
, Hino

!」
％Ｂ
「Wha, aren't we gonna eat lunch first?」
Natsuki
「We'll just eat later. Let's give these to everyone first. C'mon, let's go already.」

％Ｂ
「S-Sure...」
Natsuki
「Oh, I've already found Marikaaa!」
Marika
「Segawa-san... This is perfect. I was just about to ask you both to come eat lunch with me.」

Natsuki
「Really? We were about to head to your classroom, so it's a good thing we didn't miss each other.」

Marika
「What? To my classroom?」
Natsuki
「Yep-yep. Here you go. This is your share of the photos from yesterday.」
Marika
「Wha...? You printed them out already?」
Natsuki
「I got a great panty shot of you too, so no showing any boys, okay?」

Marika
「Wha... Y-You took a photo like that!?」
Natsuki
「Ahaha, I'm kidding, kidding.」
Marika
「G-Geez...」
Natsuki
「Oh, and by the way, we're about to go hand the rest out to the others. So sorry, but you'll have to eat without us.」


Marika
「"We"...? 
Hino-kun, you're 
You're 
going too?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah... She told me to help her.」
Natsuki
「He's my assistant. See you, then. Come on
, Hino

, let's go.」
％Ｂ
「Right. Later, Shinozaki.」
Marika
「Oh, mhm... Thanks for the photos.」
Natsuki
「You're welcome!」
We're in the third-year classroom hallway to give Okihara-senpai her photos.

％Ｂ
「Upperclassman classrooms always feel kinda different. Makes me a bit nervous to step inside―」

Natsuki
「Heeeey, Misa-saaan, you heeere?」
％Ｂ
「Wha...!?」
She's just immediately calling out for her?
Natsuki
「Oh, there she is! Excuse meee!」
I stare dumbfoundedly as Segawa saunters into the classroom.

all
％Ｂ
「Wow, she's amazing... Wait, I need to go in too... Excuse meee...」
Misa
「Oh my, what might the two of you be here for?」

Natsuki
「We're going around giving everyone the photos from when we went camping yesterday. Here you go, this is your share.」

Misa
「What? ...Really?」
Natsuki
「Of course. I made sure to get a good shot of you changing when we went to the hot springs.」

％Ｂ
「So you're gonna keep that up, huh...」
Misa
「Oh my, how embarrassing. Ufufu.」
％Ｂ
「Ohh... Wow, that's Senpai for you... She's not shaken at all...」
Misa
「Yesterday was very fun. I found it difficult to sleep with how excited I was, even after going home.」

％Ｂ
「I'm very glad you enjoyed it.」
Misa
「I think I would like to do something together with all of you again.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, that sounds nice.」
Natsuki
「Want to go to the beach next time? We could do a barbecue on the sand, or play with fireworks. Or, we could stay the night in tents and have a big campfire! How about that?」


％Ｂ
「You're more of an outdoors person than I thought...」
Natsuki
「You didn't think I was? Of course I'm an outdoors person, I'm a cameraman.」
Misa
「Hehe... Those also seem fun, but I personally have something else in mind I may like to do together with you all.」


all
％Ｂ
「Something else?」
Misa
「I will save the reveal for another time.」
％Ｂ
「Uh huh...」
I wonder what it is...
all
％Ｂ
「...You know, Segawa, I'm impressed.」
Natsuki
「Huh? With what?」
％Ｂ
「I'm surprised you could just walk into a third-year classroom like that. I feel like most people would hesitate a little more.」

Natsuki
「Hmm... Maybe it's 'cause I'm always going in and out of all sorts of classrooms for the grad-alb committee? I don't really hesitate over stuff like that.」

Natsuki
「Oh, but I guess I might've been a little nervous that time I was infiltrating the guys' bathrooms.」

％Ｂ
「I guess I'll ask, but... why'd you go into the guys' bathrooms?」
Natsuki
「Huh? Because I thought I'd take a scene of the hidden daily lives of boys, obviously. Don't you think standing in a line and doing your business is just youth?」


％Ｂ
「I don't really know if I should be speaking for all guys, but please, don't...」

all
Natsuki
「Oh, I knew she'd be here. Heeey, Soraaa!」
Sora
「...Hamh... mgmgh.」
We walk out onto the roof to find Ousaka eating bread by herself.

Natsuki
「We didn't see you in your classroom when we went to go check, so I figured this would be the only other place I'd find you.」

Sora
「...Gulp.」
Natsuki
「Here, there are the photos from camping yesterday. We're going around giving them to everyone. This is your share.」

Sora
「...Hamh... mgmgh.」
Natsuki
「They're filled with enough of your sexy-dynamite niiice body to get 
Hino 
this guy 
excited just from looking! Right

, Hino

?」
％Ｂ
「...」
Natsuki
「Huh? 
Hino? 

Something wrong?」
％Ｂ
「...That's not fair, Ousaka.」
all
Sora
「...Gulp... Not fair?」
％Ｂ
「I decided I wanted to eat lunch up on the roof the first time I came up here 'cause of how nice it feels... but I gave up 'cause the rooftop's supposed to be off limits...」


％Ｂ
「But you're... You're just up here and you're...」
Sora
「...I eat here occasionally.」
％Ｂ
「I'm so jealous, dammit!」

Natsuki
「Here I was, wondering what you were talking about... Anyway, isn't the astronomy club allowed to be up here specifically?」

％Ｂ
「It's just for club activities. Eating lunch isn't a club activity!」
Natsuki
「Yeah, that's true.」
Sora
「...No issues.」
all
Ousaka pulls out a notebook.
She flips to a page with what looks like a pie chart split into twelve even pieces, and props up a stick in the center.

Sora
「...Sundial research.」
Natsuki
「I get it! You're definitely doing club activities, then.」
％Ｂ
「Not faaaaaaaaaiiirrr!! You have this all planned oooouttt!!」
She's way more on top of things than she looks!
all
Natsuki
「Nooow then, it's just Touko left... I wonder where she is.」
Yukimura wasn't in her classroom.
We looked around the cafeteria too, but she wasn't anywhere to be found.
She might be in the old school building...
Natsuki
「Aghh, geez, where the heck is she!?」
all
The old school building's a secret between Yukimura and me.
Segawa might be a friend, but I'm not about to tell her about it.
But if things keep up like this, then I'm not going to have any time left to eat lunch...

％Ｂ
「Uhh... How about we try going that way?」
Natsuki
「Why? It's only the old school building over there.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, but... I just kinda get the feeling Yukimura's over there.」

I'll just take Segawa to the hallway that leads to the old school building.
If we run into Yukimura there, then that works out.
If we don't, then we can just turn back.
％Ｂ
「My primal instinct's telling me Yukimura's over there... Maybe... Probably... There's a possibility...!」

Natsuki
「That's a really rough primal instinct... but okay, let's try going.」

all
_00cutinBS
Natsuki
「Huh? Touko?」
％Ｂ
「Oh...」
Yukimura's walking down the hallway toward us.
She must've been in the old school building after all.
Natsuki
「You're kidding... She's really here... Why?」
_00cutinBS
Touko
「Oh... What are you two doing here?」
Yukimura feigns a casual tone while she glares at me.
％Ｂ
「Segawa was looking for you, 'cause she wants to give you some photos from yesterday. So I was helping her, and we just happened! to come here, and we just happened! to see you here.」


I put a lot of emphasis on the "just happened"s, trying to get the point across that I didn't necessarily spill the beans about the old school building.

Touko
「Ohh... I get it. Mhm, I just happened to be taking a walk through the school building, and I just happened to decide to come this way.」

Looks like she got the gist.
Touko
「So what'd you wanna give me again? Photos from yesterday? You went through the trouble of printing them out for me?」

％Ｂ
「Segawa, come on.」

Natsuki
「Oh, yeah. Here. This is your share.」
Touko
「I feel kinda bad. I only joined in at the last moment.」
％Ｂ
「Nah, we were the ones who asked you to come out anyway. We'd have just been drinking curry soup if you hadn't brought that rice, so I'm glad you came.」


Natsuki
「That's right. You were everyone's savior when you brought that rice. Friends are always a good thing to have.」

Touko
「Wha... Friends? ...Who are you talking about?」
Natsuki
「I'm talking about us, obviously. We're already people who've eaten food from the same bowl! We're friends!」

Touko
「...You're unexpectedly old fashioned sometimes, Camera-chan. But... Hmm... Friends...」

all
Yukimura flips through the photos.
Touko
「Mhm... It might not be bad every now and then. Thanks for the photos. I'll take my time looking through them later.」

She smiles a little bashfully.
Touko
「We should get back to our classrooms soon. Lunch break's almost over.」
all
％Ｂ
「Uh... Wait a second, what about lunch for us!?」
Natsuki
「Sorry, but it doesn't look like we'll make it at this point.」
％Ｂ
「You're kidding... I have to skip lunch...?」
all
After school.
％Ｂ
「Hey, have you gotten any paperwork from the naturalist and astronomy clubs?」
Shuuichi
「No, not yet.」
％Ｂ
「Really...」
all
So Okihara-senpai and Ousaka still haven't submitted any paperwork pertaining to their participation in the Tanabata Festival.

They've both rescinded their nonparticipation, but they still haven't formally decided to participate either.

％Ｂ
「I guess I'll wait a little longer.」
Shuuichi
「You've talked to them about what they could do for the festival, right?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, a few times.」
Shuuichi
「It should be fine, then. If you're worried, then why don't you go ask for their paperwork?」
％Ｂ
「I'd just be putting pressure on them if I did that, right?」
all
Natsuki
「Nirasawa, you heeere?」
％Ｂ
「Whoa!?」
Shuuichi
「S-Segawa... How many times do I have to tell you, learn to knock already!」

I have to agree with Shuuichi.
Having the door opened on you out of nowhere's pretty bad for the heart.
Natsuki
「Oh, 
Hino, 

you're here too? That's perfect then.」
％Ｂ
「Huh?」
Natsuki
「Hey, Nirasawa. Could I borrow 
Hino
him
?」
％Ｂ
「Wha?」
Shuuichi
「What are you talking about?」
Natsuki
「It's a request as a grad-alb committee member. I want to borrow 
Hino 
him 
to be my assistant.」

Shuuichi
「Hm, as a grad-alb committee member, you say. I'll hear you out seriously, then.」

Natsuki
「I'm confident in my own photography, as a member of the grad-alb committee. But there's also a definite limit to what I can do alone. I've been wanting a useful assistant for a while now.」


％Ｂ
「Wait a second. I get why you'd want an assistant, but why me?」

Natsuki
「'Cause you're useful. I was honestly shocked at that instinct of yours when we found Yukimura today.」

％Ｂ
「...Uhh...」
Shuuichi
「Man... Did you screw something up in front of Segawa?」
％Ｂ
「I don't know if I'd call it... Well, I guess you could call it that...」

Natsuki
「So anyway, that's why I want 
Hino 
him 
as my assistant. I want him to follow me when I'm doing grad-alb committee work and help me with things.」


％Ｂ
「There's no way we could set things up just like that. I'm already a member of the event committee, and I've gotta help out with the astronomy and naturalist clubs.」


Natsuki
「So you're saying you'll help the astronomy and naturalist clubs, but not the grad-alb committee? Don't you think that's unfair? Is it okay for the event committee to be playing favorites like that?」


％Ｂ
「Wh-What do you mean, playing favorites... That's not what I meant...」
Natsuki
「So you'll help out the grad-alb committee too, right? There's no reason you wouldn't, right?」

all
％Ｂ
「H-Hey, Shuuichi, say something.」
Shuuichi
「...Segawa's got a point.」
％Ｂ
「Wha...!?」
Shuuichi
「The event committee and grad-alb committee have to always maintain close, harmonious relations. If this is a formal request from a grad-alb committee member, then we can't just disregard it.」


％Ｂ
「Yeah, but that doesn't mean―」

Natsuki
「You're actually being understanding for once, Nirasawa.」
Shuuichi
「But I'm adding a condition. Segawa, you have to help\n\r
Ryousuke 
him 
back. When he's helping out the astronomy and naturalist clubs as a member of the event committee, you'll be helping him too.」


Shuuichi
「I'll lend 
Ryousuke 
him 
to you if you're fine with that.」
％Ｂ
「Wait, you can't just decide―」
Natsuki
「So it's give and take. I was planning on helping the astronomy and naturalist clubs anyway, so I have no problem with that condition at all!」


Shuuichi
「It's decided, then.」
Natsuki
「Looks like it.」
The two of them exchange a firm handshake while I stare dumbfounded.
％Ｂ
「...You've gotta be kidding me...」
I have to act as Segawa's assistant?
This is just too sudden...
％Ｂ
「H-Hey... Is this seriously okay?」
Shuuichi
「Hm... It is.」
％Ｂ
「B-But even if the event committee and the grad-alb committee are close, being an assistant's...」


Natsuki
「What, are you still complaining? You're so hopeless. Fine, I'll give you a formal description of the grad-alb committee.」

all
A grad-alb committee member―
...Is to create a graduation album from the perspective of "the student."
...Primarily takes photos of their own class year.
...Has special privilege to enter various locations for the purpose of taking photos for events (※They are to make sure to wear an armband in that case).

...Is also in charge of picking out photos for the graduation album.
...Is allowed to have up to one assistant.
And that is "everything that one needs to know about the grad-alb committee," according to Segawa Natsuki.

Natsuki
「Those who go against these commandments are to commit seppuku!」
％Ｂ
「Are you guys the Shinsengumi or something...?」
Natsuki
「So anyway, that's how it is, so you're formally my assistant starting today. I'll be counting on you, Mr. Assistant!」

％Ｂ
「No waaay...」
I don't know if I'll be able to keep up with her...
