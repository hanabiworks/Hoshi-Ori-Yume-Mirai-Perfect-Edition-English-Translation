The trees on the roadside are starting to change color.
It's been about half a year since I started working at Mr. Azuma's firm.

Azuma
「The deadline for the idea competition's tomorrow. How's that going?」
％Ｂ
「Yes, I think I'll be able to finish by tonight.」
I've built up my experience a little at a time while doing on-site work.
I've been living out a busy, but fulfilling work life where every day is another way of stockpiling experience.

Azuma
「You're gonna stay a low-ranker next year if you don't win, all right? I don't really care if I don't have to raise your salary, so feel free to fail as much as you'd like.」


％Ｂ
「No... And you're the one who recommended I do this because I could probably place in it.」


Azuma
「...Was I? I don't remember that.」
Yeah, he was drunk back then...
But it's definitely true that this is a big opportunity for me.
This'll be a great selling point for me if I win an award.
I need to end up with something I'm satisfied with, even if it takes me all night!
Azuma
「It's fine to be motivated, but don't force yourself, all right? I can't imagine what Touko-chan would say to me if you keeled over.」

％Ｂ
「Touko's studying hard for her exam that's coming up. I need to do my best too.」

Azuma
「I see, so it's time already. Hope it goes well this year.」
％Ｂ
「She's working hard to prepare for the second exam too. I think her foundations are solid.」

I really do think Touko's been putting in a lot of good effort lately.
She's passed the first exam, so this must be her going, "This year for sure."

On top of that, she's still been doing all of the housework without a hitch.\n\r

I could never be grateful enough.
Azuma
「The second exam's... an essay and a presentation. It's where they'll see how knowledgeable you are, and how good of a feel you have for things.」

％Ｂ
「Yes, so there's nothing I can really help her with. The most I can do is give advice on blueprints and giving presentations.」

I don't do anything other than look over her work for her these days.\n \n\r
Touko's efforts up until now have truly borne fruit. I feel a little sad as her tutor now that I don't have much of a role to play in her preparations.

Azuma
「It wouldn't do for you to fail that competition when Touko-chan passes her exam. Do your best not to embarrass yourself.」

％Ｂ
「Yes. I'll give it my all and come back with good results!」

He provides me with some backhanded encouragement.
And it's just like he says. I can't let myself fail.

％Ｂ
「...All right. Let's do this!」
