─Day four of work.
The sun shines down from above. There aren't many clouds.
It's a clear, summery day.
I bet going to the beach or the pool would feel great today.
Hiking too. I like the idea of walking through the dappled forest sunlight, listening to the whispering of the leaves swaying in the wind, maybe even dipping my bare feet in a cool stream.

It's a summer break that could have been.
But─
Grade-School Boy A
「Take this!」
$$smh_OpenCHK
Shio-wan
「...」
Grade-School Boy B
「Take that!」
Shio-wan
「...」
...Yet another day of being kicked around by schoolchildren for Shio-wan...
Though why the heck is it just Shio-wan that's getting kicked around?
I wonder if the kids can just kinda tell who's inside the suits.
There are a bunch of girls gathered around Shio-nyah. Sure looks nice and peaceful...

Grade-School Boy A
「Take that!」
Shio-wan
「...」
Staff
「No kicking Shio-wan, okaaay?」
Couldn't you be a bit sterner...?
Grade-School Boy B
「Heh, this guy's so slow!」
That's just how the character is. Sue me.
If I was allowed to move fast, then I would.
Grade-School Boy A
「Try catching us if you can!」
I pretend to start chasing after them, but the kids run away immediately.

Shio-wan continues to be pummeled by their hit-and-run tactics.

Dammit... I'm gonna curse these little brats to have to wear one of these themselves in the future.
You're gonna be on the side that gets kicked, and regret your past actions!
Just like I am now!
Grade-School Girl A
「You're so cute, Shio-nyah♪」
Shio-nyah
「...」
all
Meanwhile, Shio-nyah falls over onto the ground time after time as the girls compliment her.

I guess she's got it pretty tough too...
But it's just for two more days. We'll have the money we need by the end of the day tomorrow.
Grade-School Girl A
「Shio-nyah, Shio-nyah, you're sooo cute～♪」
all
Hm?
Shio-nyah
「...」
Shio-nyah falls over again.
...But the way she fell over this time was...
Shio-nyah
「...Hahh... Hah... hahh...」
Grade-School Girl A
「Shio-nyah? Are you okay?」
Shio-nyah doesn't move at all.
Grade-School Girl A
「Ahhh! Shio-nyah died!」
Staff
「Wha...? Shio-nyah?」
Shio-wan
「Gh...!」
I don't think about my situation. I just move.
I sprint over to Shio-nyah faster than anyone else and hold her in my arms.

Grade-School Boy A
「Shio-wan's so fast!」
Grade-School Girl A
「Shio-wan's saving Shio-nyah!」
Today's especially hot.
She might be suffering from heatstroke or dehydration inside the costume.

I bridal carry the limp Shio-nyah and run to the office.

％Ｂ
「Sora, you okay? Sora?」
I take her costume head off and wipe the sweat from her face with a towel.

％Ｂ
「I'm taking this off you.」
She's wearing her swimsuit under the costume again.
I hurriedly start to cool her down.
I place wet towels on her forehead and neck, and place cold soda cans between her arms and sides.\n\r

I point fans at her.
I need to cool her down as quickly as I can.
％Ｂ
「Here, can you drink?」
I stick a straw in a bottle of sports drink and bring it up to her lips.

Sora
「...Mm, slrp...」
Looks like she at least has the energy to drink.
Staff
「You okay? Maybe I should call an ambulance?」
Sora
「...*shake shake*」
％Ｂ
「...I think she's got a little heatstroke. She should recover if she gets enough water and rest.」

％Ｂ
「But we may have to take her to the hospital if she starts feeling worse.」

Sora
「...I'll be fine in a bit.」
％Ｂ
「No. You're done for today.」
Sora
「...I'm fine.」
％Ｂ
「Just rest.」
Sora
「...But... everyone's working hard. I can't be the only one resting...」

％Ｂ
「Yeah. But we're all doing our best to make the planetarium a success, right?」

％Ｂ
「You need to be healthy for the planetarium to be a success. You've still got the important job of communicating the wonder of the stars to the guests, don't you?」


Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「You need to be healthy for the planetarium to be complete. So don't overexert yourself now, and rest. Please.」

Sora
「...Okay... I won't overexert myself.」
She nods apologetically.
all
Staff
「How about we stop the costume advertising for today? It's pretty hot outside, after all.」

％Ｂ
「No, I'm still fine. Shio-nyah won't be there, but I'll go out in case there are any kids waiting.」


Sora
「...Don't overexert yourself
, Ryou

...」
％Ｂ
「Don't worry. I'll handle the rest.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
I head back out to the marketplace.
Though thinking back on it, maybe I shouldn't have done what I did earlier.\n \n\r
Shio-wan's supposed to only be able to move slowly. I know I didn't have much choice, but Shio-wan still ended up moving normally to save Shio-nyah.

I hope I didn't break the illusion for the kids...
Grade-School Boy A
「Look, it's Shio-wan!」
Grade-School Girl A
「Shio-wan!」
Shio-wan
「...!? ...!??」
The kids immediately surround me.
I can see their parents and other adults around us.
I feel like there are more people than before...
Shio-wan
「...?」
...What the heck's going on?
The adults are all applauding Shio-wan.
Grade-School Boy B
「You're so cool, Shio-wan!」
...What?
Grade-School Girl A
「You saved Shio-nyah! You're so nice!」
Shio-wan
「...」
...I didn't expect this response.
Grade-School Boy A
「What the heck, Shio-wan! You can move fast! You were hiding your true strength!」

The boys who had only just been attacking Shio-wan now look at him with glittering, envious eyes.

It looks like they've taken the way I moved when I saved Shio-nyah to mean that Shio-wan has hidden power.

Grade-School Boy B
「Let's shake hands, Shio-wan!」
Female High School Girl A
「Let's take a photo together, Shio-wan♪」
Grade-School Girl A
「Mooom, I wanna take a photo with Shio-wan too!」
Everyone surges toward Shio-wan.
Staff
「No pushing, please! It's dangerous, so please, no pushing! He'll take photos with everyone in order! Ahh, don't push!」

The staff person's frantic to try to control the situation.
Shio-wan's become a bit of a hero now.
Shio-wan
「...」
I take photos over and over with all of the customers.
I'm worried about Sora, but I have to do what I can do for now.

Shio-wan
「...」
I find Sora in the break room after finishing for the day. She looks better.
Sora
「...
Ryou
Oh
.」
％Ｂ
「Sora! Are you feeling better? No nausea or headache?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「Okay... Thank god.」
Sora
「...I'm sorry for making everyone worry.」
％Ｂ
「No, I don't really...」
Staff
「No need to worry. It's no problem for us either. In fact, this worked out great because Shio-wan's so popular now!」


Staff
「Anyway, what do you want to do tomorrow? If you're not feeling up to it, Ousaka-san, I can have someone else be Shio-nyah.」


Sora
「...*shake shake*」
Sora
「...I'll work hard tomorrow.」
％Ｂ
「You sure?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
Staff
「Well, you're done with this tomorrow anyway, so I'll let the two of you handle the roles of Shio-wan and Shio-nyah. But make sure you don't overexert yourself, okay?」


％Ｂ
「Thank you very much.」
％Ｂ
「That's great, Sora.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
Sora and I head to school to tell the others about how work went today.\n \n\r
I wanted Sora to go home to fully recover from her heatstroke, but she wouldn't budge on coming with, saying she was fine.

％Ｂ
「It's great that they paid us six hours' worth for you too.」
Sora
「He said it was because you worked hard.


」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, but I didn't really do anything different. Oh, but actually, the kids stopped kicking me after I saved Shio-nyah.」


％Ｂ
「There were more kids who wanted to shake my hand and take photos with me. It made me super happy.」

Sora
「...
Ryou
Um
...」
％Ｂ
「Hm?」
Sora
「Thank you for saving me...」
％Ｂ
「You don't need to thank me. I'm your boyfriend. Of course I'd save you.」

Sora
「...But it made me happy.」
％Ｂ
「I'll always come save you when you're in trouble.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「It's just one more day. Let's do our best.」
all
─Later that night.
％Ｂ
「...What the heck!?」
I was vaguely looking at the Shionagi marketplace's website when I notice that something new's been added to Shio-wan's character bio.

"Shio-wan's normally very slow, but when the fires of justice burn in his heart, he becomes Super Shio-wan and can do super-speed side-stepping!"

％Ｂ
「...They don't want me to do that tomorrow, do they...?」
That's just crazy...
