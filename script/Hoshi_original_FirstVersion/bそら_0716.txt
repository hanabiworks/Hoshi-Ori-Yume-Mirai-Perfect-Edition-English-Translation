Sora and I are at the marketplace to buy plastic boards together after school, like we said we would yesterday.

$$smh_OpenCHK
％Ｂ
「Oh... That place might give us some.」
I've been on the lookout for stores that might give us cardboard on the way.

Whenever I see a store with cardboard left outside or lots of boxes being used for carrying their wares, I put their name down into my phone.


％Ｂ
「Hm... There are a lot of stores that use cardboard. I think we'll be able to get everything we need. What do you think, Sora?」

％Ｂ
「...Uh?」
I look around to see that Sora's walking a little behind me.
Her movements are a little stiff.
％Ｂ
「What's wrong? You feeling sick?」
Sora
「...*shake shake*」
Sora
「...It's a little hard to walk.」
％Ｂ
「It's hard to walk? Why?」
Sora
「...」
Her face goes bright red.
Sora
「...It's your fault
, Ryou

.」
％Ｂ
「My fault?」
What's that mean?
Sora
「...To be specific... It still feels like it's inside me.」



％Ｂ
「...Ah.」
I finally understand.
It's because of what we did yesterday.
％Ｂ
「O-Oh, really...」
My face goes red too.
％Ｂ
「Uh... I dunno what to say... Sorry.」
Sora
「...You don't need to apologize. It's what I wanted...」
％Ｂ
「B-But... It hurt, right? Or more like it still hurts, right?」
Sora
「...I've heard it's normal for it to hurt.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, but...」
Sora
「...And I'm also happy. I'm still happy today from yesterday.」

She squeezes my hand tight.
Sora
「...I'm happy that we can walk together like this now.」
％Ｂ
「All right. I'll match my pace to yours, so let's walk slowly.」
I hold hands with her as we head toward the store we're looking for.
We pick up the plastic boards at a model shop.
％Ｂ
「I haven't been to that model shop in a while. I used to go to that one a lot and stare at model castles that I couldn't afford.」


Sora
「...Was it nostalgic?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah... I was interested in those model castles even before I knew I wanted to be an architect... So I guess that means that model castles are where I got my start...?」


Azuma
「Hoh, so you got your start with model castles.」
all
％Ｂ
「Uh...?」
That voice...
Azuma
「What a coincidence. Me too.」
％Ｂ
「Oh... Teacher!」
Azuma-san walks up to us from behind.
He's holding a paper bag with the same model shop's branding on it.
Azuma
「Hmm... I thought I hadn't seen you around the firm lately. So this is why.」

％Ｂ
「Wha...?」
Azuma-san's grinning at me and Sora holding hands.

Azuma
「I can see why you wouldn't have the time to come to the firm when you've gotten yourself a girlfriend this cute.」

％Ｂ
「O-Oh no! Um... This is, well...」
Azuma
「There's nothing to worry about. I'm not harassing you about it. I'm just messing with you.」

％Ｂ
「Uuuh...」
Sora
「...Who's this?」
％Ｂ
「Oh... This is Azuma-san. He's my teacher, and he's the architect I respect more than anyone else.」
Azuma
「I don't recall ever becoming your teacher... And don't say you respect me when I'm right here. It makes me feel ticklish.」


Sora
「...Teacher...?」
Azuma
「It's very nice to meet you, young lady. I'm Azuma Morio, an architect. I'd love it if you could remember my name if the subject of designing a house ever comes up for you.」


％Ｂ
「You don't need to stoop so low to advertise yourself in a place like this, Teacher.」
Azuma
「An architect's nothing without work to do.」
Sora
「...Azuma... Morio...」
Azuma
「Hm?」
％Ｂ
「...I'm saying this now, but don't shorten his name like you usually do, all right? He's laid back, but he's a really impressive architect.」


Azuma
「Being impressive or not doesn't matter for an architect. You've still got a long way to go if you're saying stuff like that.」

％Ｂ
「I-I'm sorry. But otherwise Sora's going to―」

Sora
「...Azuma Morio... Mo-san...」
Azuma
「M-Mo-san?」
％Ｂ
「...I mean... I guess you're being respectful with the "-san," but...」
Azuma
「Mo-san... Never been called that before. It's like someone's discovered a new side of me. It made my heart flutter a bit.」


％Ｂ
「Come on, Teacher, please don't get emotional about that.」
Azuma
「What's your name, young lady?」
Sora
「...Ousaka Sora.」
Azuma
「Sora-chan. It's nice to meet you.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
Azuma
「She's cute. I can definitely see why you haven't been coming to the firm.」

％Ｂ
「No, like I said, that's not why. I haven't been to the firm recently because I joined the event committee.」

Azuma
「Event committee? The heck's that?」
I explain to him what I've been doing lately.
all
Azuma
「So you're helping your school's astronomy club make their planetarium as a member of the event committee.」

％Ｂ
「Yes... And so I haven't been able to come to the firm lately because I've been busy with that.」

Azuma
「Looks like you've got time for dates with your girlfriend, though.」
％Ｂ
「N-No! We're here today to buy the plastic boards we need for―」
Azuma
「All right, you don't have to get so defensive about everything. I'm only ever messing with you.」

％Ｂ
「...Please stop messing with me then, Teacher.」
Azuma
「Hmph... Well, either way, it looks like you're making pretty good use of your time.」

％Ｂ
「Uh... Good use... of my time?」
Azuma
「Yeah. A lot better than if you were just working part-time at the firm.」

Azuma
「Just think about it. It might be just cardboard, but you're still making a dome for a planetarium. You almost never get experience building something that unique.」


Azuma
「It's something you could only have done while working in that event committee of yours. You can experience that because you're a student. I think it's an excellent use of your time.」


％Ｂ
「...Do you really?」
Azuma
「Architecture's something anyone can learn if they study. But what you really need as an architect is to have a sense for aesthetics, so you can use those skills to give form to things.」


Azuma
「For now, you should keep using your time like that to have times you can only have now at your age, and widen your worldview by interacting with various perspectives. And romance is just another way of doing that. Enjoy yourself.」


％Ｂ
「So I should build up my sense for aesthetics that way...」
It might be just as... or maybe even more important than learning techniques.

Azuma
「Either way, feel free to come by the firm again if you run into any trouble.」
％Ｂ
「Yes! I'd love to!」
Azuma
「It's back to work for me, then. See you, Sora-chan.」

Sora
「...Bye-bye... Mo-san.」
Azuma
「Yeah... Man, I really like that... Mo-san...」
all
Sora
「...Mo-san... He's funny.」
％Ｂ
「...Yeah, he's a bit eccentric.」
all
Now that I think about it, I wonder what he was doing here.
He was holding a bag from the model store... Did he come here just to buy a model castle or something...?

I could see him doing that...
％Ｂ
「...」
Sora
「...That was me.」
She admitted it.
％Ｂ
「We've already got what we came to get, so wanna get something to eat before we go back to school?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「What do you wanna eat?」
I already more or less know what she's going to say, but I ask just in case.
all
I order a cheeseburger without pickles for Sora, and a regular burger and fries for myself.

％Ｂ
「...Hm?」
I spot a free pamphlet of part-time job listings near the store entrance.

I grab one and walk out.
％Ｂ
「Thanks for waiting. Let's head back to school.」
Sora
「...What's that?」
She points at the pamphlet.
％Ｂ
「It's a listing of part-time jobs I found in the store. Figured we needed to start thinking about where we're gonna work.」

Sora
「...I want to see too.」
％Ｂ
「Let's take a look together, then.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「...It looks like the short-term, well-paying part-time jobs are all mostly manual labor.」

We started looking through the pamphlet as soon as we got back to school.
I could probably work as a part-time mover or security guard if it were just me.
Those jobs pay well, and a lot of them pay by the day.
But Sora can't do any manual labor.
Actually... What kinda job could Sora even do?
She doesn't talk much, so customer service isn't a good idea either.
She's good at cooking, so maybe she could work in a kitchen...?
But those jobs don't pay particularly well, and they're paid monthly too.
all
％Ｂ
「Hmm...」
Maybe we should have Sora gather up cardboard with the others after all and start on putting the dome together without me...?


I could probably earn the money we need within a week if I worked a manual labor job all day every day...

Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「Oh... Wh-What?」
I've just realized Sora's been staring at me.
Sora
「...*shake shake*」
％Ｂ
「Huh?」
Sora
「...I'm going to work with you.」
％Ｂ
「Uh...」
It's like she read my mind.
She's strangely perceptive...
％Ｂ
「...You're right. Sorry.」
I don't bother trying to deceive her and apologize. I pat her lightly on the head.
％Ｂ
「Let's find a job we can both do together.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
