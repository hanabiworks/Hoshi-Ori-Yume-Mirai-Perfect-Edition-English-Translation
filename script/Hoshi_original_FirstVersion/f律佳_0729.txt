Rikka and Meguru-chan are going to start practicing for the Shio-cademy Fest today.

I've dropped by to see how it's going while I'm doing stuff to help with the rest of the Shionagi Friends.
The two of them sit at the piano with handwritten sheet music before them.
It's the piano four hands arrangement for "A Fragment of Emotion."
It was written by their mother Sayaka-san. There are only two sets of this sheet music in existence.

Meguru
「Which do you want, Onee-chan?」
Rikka
「Let's see... How about I'm primo and you're secondo? I think it'll be a better performance that way.」

％Ｂ
「I remember you mentioning that before. What's primo and secondo?」
Rikka
「Primo refers to the first performer who's responsible for the high notes, and secondo is the second performer who's responsible for the low notes.」

Meguru
「You can just think of it as the primo being the one to sit on the right side of the piano, and the secondo's on the left side.」
％Ｂ
「I see.」
Primo on the right, secondo on the left. Simple enough.
Rikka
「The foundation of a performance lies in the low notes. The low notes usually create the tempo and rhythm, while the high notes create the melody.」
Rikka
「The piece as a whole relies on the low notes being played well. So in a way, the secondo has a more difficult role than the primo.」

％Ｂ
「Huh... I usually focus more on the melody when I listen to music, so I always thought that'd be the harder part.」
Meguru
「It's traditional for the primo to take the lead in orchestras and such.」

Meguru
「So the answer as to which of the two parts is more difficult differs based on a piece's structure and content.」

Rikka
「We'll need to look carefully at the way we both play before deciding for sure. Let's try playing through it once.」

Meguru
「That sounds good.」
％Ｂ
「Huh? You're gonna play it already?」
Rikka
「Mhm. It's not our first time playing it. I've played this before with Meguru in the past.」

Meguru
「Let's have a look at how good you've gotten, Onee-chan.」

Rikka
「Don't put too much pressure on me.」
Meguru
「Ehehe, I'm sorryyy～」
They can joke around about playing piano now.
This is how these two sisters should be.
It's heartwarming watching them.
Rikka
「Geez... Let's start.」
Meguru
「Okaaay.」
all
Their smiles fade as they focus.
Rikka and Meguru-chan match their breathing.
The music classroom falls silent, and then...
The first note falls.
Meguru-chan swings her fingertip directly downward, and the performance begins―

％Ｂ
「Whoa, that was awesome! That was already pretty much perfect, wasn't it!?」
I start clapping as a matter of course once they finish.
Rikka
「Not at all.」

Meguru
「There's still a ways to go.」
％Ｂ
「Really? It didn't really sound like there was anything wrong to me.」

Meguru
「I was pressing the pedals just a little too early starting at around this measure.」

Rikka
「Both of our playing styles have changed since back then, so it isn't surprising.」

Meguru
「You're right. Your sound was really rich, Onee-chan. It sounded like you were having so much fun.」
Rikka
「Did it? Mhm, I think I was.」
Rikka smiles at Meguru-chan, and then at me.
Meguru
「Maybe I should let you handle the pedals for this part like I used to.」
Rikka
「Okay. I'll do the same here too, then.」
The two of them point at the sheet music as they talk.
％Ｂ
「So the pedals are that important?」
I've never really paid much attention to Rikka pressing the pedals. I was always focused on her fingers.

Rikka
「They are. These three pedals control the way the notes come out. They're the unsung backbone of a performance.」

Rikka
「And it gets especially difficult to use them well for piano four hands, because they have to control the sound of two people at once.」

Meguru
「The secondo is typically the one in charge of the pedals, but Onee-chan and I used to switch off in the middle of some pieces when we played.」
Rikka
「We should also think about the balance of the sound too. Meguru, you were matching your sound to mine, weren't you?」

Meguru
「And you were matching your sound to mine too, right?」
I have absolutely no idea what they're talking about.
Though it's fine as long as they're having fun practicing together.
Now then. I should go back to where I'm needed.
all
Meguru
「It's very helpful that you came with, Senpai. Thank you very much.」

Rikka
「Thank you. Isn't that heavy, though? Should I hold half of it?」
％Ｂ
「This is fine. I can hold about twice this much.」
I'm holding a reusable grocery bag filled with food.
I went to Shionagi's main street with the Narusawas after school to help them with grocery shopping.

Rikka apparently hasn't had much time to get groceries, what with Meguru-chan being here and her being busy with committee work and practice.

Going to the marketplace with just Rikka's nice, but shopping together with Meguru-chan's also lively and fun.
Meguru
「Oh, it's a shaved ice stand!」
％Ｂ
「Oh. Would you look at that.」
all
The sweets café's selling shaved ice in front of the store, just for summer.
There are lots of different toppings available, like sweet-bean syrup, flour dumplings, ice cream, and frozen fruits.

％Ｂ
「Seeing stuff like that really makes it feel like summer's here.」
This part of Japan's cooler during the summer than where I used to live.
But it still gets over 25 degrees around this time of year, with the weather clearing up after the hurricane.

I'm sure the summer's going to be hot after the Tanabata Festival.
％Ｂ
「I suddenly want some now.」
％Ｂ
「Rikka. I dunno if I'll be able to finish a whole one, so you wanna split it? Plus, I only have a hand free right now.」

Rikka
「...Is that the real motive here?」
％Ｂ
「It'd make me happy if you did. Though I do really want the shaved ice too.」
Rikka
「Hehe. What am I going to do with you? Okay, I'll feed you.」
％Ｂ
「You can pick whatever flavor you want.」
Rikka
「I want the uji matcha, then.」
％Ｂ
「Roger that. Let's get some condensed milk with sweet-bean syrup and the flour dumplings too while we're at it.」


％Ｂ
「What about you, Meguru-chan?」
Meguru
「What? Me too?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. What do you want?」
Meguru
「I'd like strawberry.」
％Ｂ
「Okay, strawberry. You don't hate condensed milk or frozen fruit, do you?」

Meguru
「No, I love them.」
％Ｂ
「I'll get those as toppings, then.」
all
Meguru
「...You're so very thoughtful. I think I may understand why Onee-chan fell for you.」

She's knowingly nodding to herself.
Meguru
「And he brought up sharing it so casually too... Are you even closer with Onee-chan than I am...?」

％Ｂ
「Meguru-chan?」
I wonder what's wrong... She's frowning so seriously.
Meguru
「Senpai! I'd like to say just one thing!」
％Ｂ
「What's that?」
Meguru
「Onee-chan and I have been heads over heels in love since we were small! Even you won't be able to pull us apart!」

％Ｂ
「Wha?」
Meguru
「I'll tearfully allow you to take the title of her lawfully wedded husband, but I will never give up the title of her mistress.」
Rikka
「Sigh... There it is.」
％Ｂ
「There what is?」
Rikka
「This is the real Meguru. You've only ever seen her keeping up airs as Narusawa Meguru, the pianist.」

Rikka
「I'm sorry about this. Don't take any offense to this, okay?」
％Ｂ
「Oh, is that all?」
％Ｂ
「That means she's relaxed around me, right? I like it. It means we're closer now.」

Meguru
「What a mature response...! Nnnhh... It seems you're not one to be underestimated, Senpai!」

It's not really that surprising considering how she normally acts toward Rikka anyway.
She probably just really loves her older sister.
％Ｂ
「But it's too bad, Meguru-chan. Rikka's heart is mine now. We feed each other all the time.」

Rikka
「Wha... Hey...!」
Meguru
「Uuuuhh...! Even I've done that with her!」

％Ｂ
「We hold the food out to each other in our mouths when we do it.」
Meguru
「Wh-Wha...!? ...Sh-She's never done that to me...」
Rikka
「We haven't done that! What are you lying for!?」
I was just trying to mess with Meguru-chan a bit, but now Rikka's mad at me.

Rikka
「...Geez. You're both children.」
Meguru
「I'm fine being a kid. I want Onee-chan to feed me too!」
％Ｂ
「I'll okay it if you let me have the first "Ahhh～"」
Meguru
「I understand. I will settle for the second "Ahhh～"」
Rikka
「Don't just decide that for yourselves...」
My life's gotten a bit noisier now that Meguru-chan's here.
My heart's filled with excitement for the Tanabata Festival.
