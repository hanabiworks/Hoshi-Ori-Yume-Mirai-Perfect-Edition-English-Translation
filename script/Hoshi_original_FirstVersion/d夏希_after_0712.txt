Sunday─
Being at home without Natsuki around makes today a rare kind of day off.
I make lunch for myself at my own pace. 
I clean up around the house at my own pace. 
And I do the laundry at my own pace.
...Something feels off.
It's weird. Freedom might be confining for me, in a way.
Now I know just how much I enjoy doing housework while making idle conversation with Natsuki.

％Ｂ
「Wonder if Natsuki's having fun with Shinozaki and Narusawa right now...」
Here I am, a husband looking out the window while thinking about his wife in the middle of a summer afternoon.
And evening comes.
I'm getting ready to cook dinner when─
Natsuki
「I-I'm hooome～」
％Ｂ
「Hey, welcome home... You seem pretty tired.」
Natsuki
「I'm fine, I'm fine～ Mmm～ chu.」
We don't forget our welcome-home kiss.
％Ｂ
「So how was your girls' night? I bet you haven't seen them in a while, so you probably talked about a lot, right?」


Natsuki
「Oh yeaaah... We just talked and talked～ They asked a toooon of questions.」

％Ｂ
「A ton of questions?」
Natsuki
「About newlywed life. I guess they were super curious. Oh, here. They said this is to celebrate us getting married.」

％Ｂ
「It's... a photo frame? Made of porcelain... This looks pretty expensive. We'll have to return the favor later.」


Natsuki
「Oh, but they already told me we don't need to do anything like that.」
％Ｂ
「We can't just not do that, though.」
Natsuki
「They said it's to celebrate, so we don't have to give anything back.」
％Ｂ
「H-Hmm... Well, I guess that's one way of thinking about it...」
Giving someone a gift back after a congratulatory gift might be a weird custom, now that I think about it...

Natsuki
「Oh man～ They asked me so much stuff about what it was like living with you.」
％Ｂ
「Like what?」
Natsuki
「Like how we wake up, who cooks, who does the cleaning and laundry, how we spend our days off, pretty much anything you could think of.」

％Ｂ
「...They, uh... didn't ask about our nights... right?」
Natsuki
「...」
％Ｂ
「No way! Girls' nights are terrifying! And wait a second, you didn't actually answer, right!??」

Natsuki
「J-Just a bit...」
％Ｂ
「So you did...」
Natsuki
「D-Don't worry! I only told them stuff like how we always sleep naked together, and how we don't need more than one pillow 'cause I use your arm as my pillow, and how sometimes we do stuff first thing in the morning.」





％Ｂ
「How is that "just a bit"!?」
Natsuki
「Don't worry! They're not kids anymore! They were all red and quiet while they were listening, like adults!」

％Ｂ
「That's just 'cause they were embarrassed!」
Natsuki
「Oh... Did I... mess it up?」
％Ｂ
「If I had to give you an answer that's either yes or no, it'd be a yes.」
Natsuki
「...We...Well, it's fine. Mhm, totally fine.」
She nods as she tries to convince herself.
I'm kinda scared of what's gonna happen when I see them at the class reunion now...
Natsuki
「By the way, they asked me if we're planning to have kids and stuff.」
％Ｂ
「Oh yeah, I bet. What'd you say?」

Natsuki
「Just what we were talking about before. That we still want to enjoy the time we have all to ourselves for now.」

She smiles bashfully.
Spending time with her friends from high school must've been special for Natsuki, since she started working earlier than everyone else.

They talked about what's been going on in their lives lately, reminisced over the past together, and talked about what they were planning to do in the near future.

Natsuki looks like she's enjoying herself as she tells me what she did today.
Natsuki
「Oh, speaking of, they told me we should use the photo frame they got us for a wedding photo.」

％Ｂ
「A wedding photo, huh? Now that I think about it, we don't have one yet.」

Natsuki
「They were surprised when I told them that. They were like, "We knew you haven't had a ceremony, but we thought you at least took a photooo!"」


％Ｂ
「...Wanna take one?」
Natsuki
「Nooo. That'd be a waste of money. We've already spent enough on the move and getting all of our stuff together. We need to budget, budget, budget.」


％Ｂ
「Well, if you say so.」
Natsuki
「And besides, if I'm gonna wear a wedding dress, then I want it to be at the ceremony. So let's look forward to that and save up for a ceremony.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah. We'll save this photo frame for when we get to use it, then.」


Natsuki
「Hey, hey. By the way. What kinda ceremony do you think we'd have?」
％Ｂ
「Hm? You just said you'd wear a wedding dress, so wouldn't that be a western-style one? In a chapel with a priest and with some "Do you vow to love eternally" stuff.」


Natsuki
「A Shinto wedding sounds refined and nice too. A Japanese-style wedding kimono's not something you get to wear every day either.」

Natsuki
「I hear nonreligious ceremonies are more of a thing nowadays too. Where you make your vows to the people there instead of to God.」


％Ｂ
「That sounds pretty fun. It'd make the people there happy too.」

Natsuki
「And I hear in other countries─」
One day, we'll hold our wedding ceremony.
We talk on and on about the dreams we have of that day.
