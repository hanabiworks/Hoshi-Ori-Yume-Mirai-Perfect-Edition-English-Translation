Misa
「It's a good thing the weather was nice today as well.」

Marika
「It's completely summer already. The sunlight's almost strong enough to make me feel a little dizzy.」

all
％Ｂ
「Speaking of, did you put your sunscreen on properly today?」
Marika
「I-I'm good today! I put it on at home. Our hot water's fixed, so I had plenty of time to prepare.」


％Ｂ
「That's good. I guess it wasn't that bad of a break, then.」

％Ｂ
「...Also, no telling your dad that you came over to use our bath, all right?」

Marika
「What? I won't tell him～ ...But why so suddenly?」

％Ｂ
「Well... Just thought I might as well say it.」

Misa
「Oh, did you use 
Ryousuke-san's 
his 
bath? It's brand new, if I recall. I'm very jealous. I'd almost like to use it myself.」


％Ｂ
「Huh? W-Well...」
If I let Shinozaki use it, and say no to Okihara-senpai...
Marika
「Y-You can't! You can't do that～」

Misa
「Why is that?」
Marika
「W-Well... 
Hino-kun's 
his 
bath... has a TV, so you might sit in it for a long time, and get all dizzy, so～」


She's just saying nonsense for some reason.
Miyuki
「Oh, it's Onii-chan and the others again!」
all
Childen's voices ring out before us.
Marika
「Oh, those kids are from the last time...」
all
Rikuto
「Are you going to catch fish again? We wanna do it too!」

％Ｂ
「Okay, then let's see who gets more! We're gonna catch more than last time.」

Itsuki
「We'll need to try hard, then!」
Misa
「Yes, please do.」
all
Miyuki
「Bye-bye!」
Marika
「Yeah, thanks. Be careful on your way home, okay?」

all
Rikuto
「Onii-chan, get better at catching fish for next time, okay?」

％Ｂ
「Gh... G-Got it.」
Kids are terrifyingly fast at picking things up.
They got good at catching fish in the blink of an eye.
They pretty much got double of what I got.
The children depart, leaving behind an odd sense of humiliation in their wake.
Well, I guess I should just be glad that we got a lot of fish.
Misa
「I will go survey this area for a bit, to get more information. The two of you can rest here.」


all
Okihara-senpai then swiftly disappears, leaving me alone with Shinozaki.
％Ｂ
「Great work today. Here, have a sports drink.」

Marika
「Yeah, thanks.」
The two of us sit on some rocks and rehydrate.
The sun's way past its zenith, and the sky's beginning to show tinges of yellow.
％Ｂ
「We were at it for a while, huh?」
Marika
「And we got lots of fish, thanks to that. I was surprised at how good the kids were.」

％Ｂ
「I know, right? You're not sunburned, are you?」

I peer at her face.
％Ｂ
「I think you've gotten kinda red. You sure you didn't burn?」

Marika
「It-It's because your face is close...」
％Ｂ
「'Cause it's close?」
Marika
「N-Never mind... Don't worry. I made sure to put on sunscreen.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah? If you say so, then. No sunstroke or anything? Do you feel hot?」


Marika
「I'm fine～ Geez, I wish you wouldn't say stuff like my dad...」

She puffs up. I guess I was acting like a parent.

Marika
「But... if you're that worried, then do you want to cool off a bit?」
％Ｂ
「Cool off?」
Marika
「Ehehe...」
She places a foot in a tide pool with a splish.
She turns a soft smile toward me.
Marika
「Wow～ ...It feels so nice.」
I see, so that's what she meant.
Marika
「This'll cool me off～ See? Feel better now?」

％Ｂ
「Guess so.」
Marika
「We got lots of pretty fish today, too. I think it'll be a really pretty aquarium.」

％Ｂ
「We'll definitely make it one. But it'd be nice if we got some rarer fish for that.」

Marika
「Yeah, that's true. We didn't really get any different fish from last time today. Okay! Let's try hard and find some rarer fish next time!」


Shinozaki looks like she's having the time of her life.
Just watching her be that happy's making me happy.

It's strange...
Now that I think about it, I don't have many memories of the two of us doing fun stuff like this together when we were kids.

Shinozaki was pretty much always in pajamas too.
Marika
「Getting to have fun like this together... is like something out of a dream...」

She speaks quietly.
She wholeheartedly thinks this is fun. The thought warms my heart.

But...
At the same time, it feels like there's something tightening deep inside my chest.
What is this?
Marika
「I hope we have lots of fun this summer.」
％Ｂ
「What kinda stuff do you wanna do?」
Marika
「We definitely have to make sure the Tanabata Festival's a success. And I wanna try swimming in the ocean too, and singing karaoke sounds fun too～」


Marika
「...And I'd like to watch a meteor shower too.」
She dreamily lists off her wishes.
That's when I realize.
Aren't those all things that Shinozaki wanted to do but couldn't when she was a kid?

Marika
「...That's a bit greedy of me. But... anything's fun together...」

％Ｂ
「Together... Yeah. It'll be fun doing things with everyone.」
Marika
「Oh, y-yeah... You're right. But it'll definitely go great! I'm looking forward to the Tanabata Festival～」


She flashes a pure smile.
And I get worried again seeing her like that.
I've been thinking of back when we were kids for a while now.
Back when I spent time together with Shinozaki, here in this town.
She never ended up being able to go to the Tanabata Festival, because she was sick.
Not the Tanabata Festival, or the closing ceremony, or the meteor shower...
％Ｂ
「...Is your asthma really under control?」
She really looks like she's gotten healthier...
But is that asthma that caused her so much suffering really gone?
Marika
「What? I'm fine now～」
She smiles brightly.
I feel like that carefree smile eases my worry a bit, but her slender body seems so frail before me. Like she might melt away into the sunset.

Marika
「Oh, I know. Don't you think there might be rare fish if we dive into the sea? Maybe I should try that tomorrow?」


％Ｂ
「Huh? You? Dive? No way, that's too dangerous.」

Marika
「It's fine, I won't dive that deep～ This area's a diving spot, so it's safe. I'm totally okay freediving anyway...」


％Ｂ
「No, you can't. What are you going to do if you have an attack underwater? No way.」


Marika
「An attack? ...You mean an asthma attack? My asthma's really okay now, though.」

％Ｂ
「But there's still a chance, isn't there? We should play it safe for catching fish. We don't need to force ourselves to get rare fish.」


Marika
「O-Okay...」
She gives a small nod, though she looks like she wants to say more.
She's a pool lifeguard, so I'm sure she should be all right.

But... the ocean's different from a pool.
We might not be able to get her help in time if something happens.
There's just too much that isn't under control.
Marika
「...」
The mood becomes awkward.
Maybe I said something unnecessary?
But I don't want to have to regret not saying it in the future.

％Ｂ
「Oh, Okihara-senpai's back.」
She's still far off, but I can't help but feel relieved.
_00cutinBS
Marika
「Looks like she's talking to someone? Maybe it's a fisher?」
％Ｂ
「I guess that's what she meant by getting information. She sure is passionate when it comes to fish.」

_00cutinBS
Marika
「She really is. Hehe...」
I'm even more relieved once I see a smile return to Shinozaki's face.
I never want to lose the chance to see this smile.
That's why I need to keep watch over her. No matter how much she may hate me for it.
