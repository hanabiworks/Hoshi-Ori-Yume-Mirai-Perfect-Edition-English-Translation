「...」
I'm lying on the sofa at the center of the jellyfish-rium, looking up at the ceiling tank.

There are jellyfish floating gracefully through the circular window into the water.
The slowly changing lights, and the sound of waves in the background.
I begin to feel like I'm drifting through the ocean as I dimly watch the jellyfish.

％Ｂ
「...」
Misa
「Welcome to Marinpia Shionagi. This exhibit is the pride of our institution... the "primordial sea: jellyfish-rium." Are you enjoying it?」


I can hear a voice.
A voice that makes me remember the day we first met, when she guided me through this aquarium.

％Ｂ
「...It's amazingly comfortable. It's seriously like I'm in a dream.」

Misa
「I'm very glad to hear that. Ufufu...」
Her laugh tickles my ears.
I sit up.
Misa
「It's all thanks to you that this hallway became the jellyfish-rium.」

Misa
「Please allow me to formally thank you. Thank you so very much.」

％Ｂ
「It's not like it was just my idea, right? This place is full of your ideas too. The two of us thought of this together.」


Misa
「Yes, that's true... But I do not think I could have created a space quite so wonderful without you. And so, it's thanks to you.」


Misa
「And I'm also grateful to Azuma-san for approving of the change to his design.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, you're right... We wouldn't have been able to make this at all if he hadn't approved of it.」

Our "primordial sea: jellyfish-rium" was unanimously accepted as the hallway display at the next round of presentations after that.


But the issue was whether Azuma-san, the chief designer, would accept our idea.

We showed him our design, with trepidation in our hearts... and he okayed it so casually I felt silly for even worrying.


Misa
「Azuma-san was praising you. He said you've become able to do good work.」

％Ｂ
「Wha... Did he really?」
Misa
「Yes. He told me... that you've become able to do a true professional's work.」


％Ｂ
「Really... So I'm finally qualified...」
Misa
「...Is there something about that?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, well... I'm happy about that, of course... but I think I'm personally happier that we finished it in time.」

We had to significantly change the placements of the tanks for this jellyfish-rium.
We weren't exactly sure if the construction would finish in time for the reopening.
The setup for the jellyfish-rium was even more complicated than expected.
The first issue was the water circulation design for the ceiling tank and its continuation into the cylindrical tank.
And there were also concerns as to whether the jellyfish might get stuck in certain spots in the complicated tank design, due to their susceptibility to currents.

Misa and the other aquarium staff, as well as the contractors, overcame each and every issue, one at a time.

％Ｂ
「I'm so glad the contractors managed to finish all of this. After all the ridiculous requests we made.」

Misa
「Everyone took on the work with very open hearts. I think it's because you've been nurturing your connections with them all this time.」


％Ｂ
「I'm seriously so grateful...」
This jellyfish-rium was completed thanks to everyone's efforts.
And tomorrow is finally the day Marinpia Shionagi resumes operations.
Misa
「To think that I would be able to not only reopen Marinpia, but also contribute to creating such a wonderful tank...」

％Ｂ
「You've really put a lot of work in, Misa.」
I praise her as she starts to look emotional.
％Ｂ
「You've put in lots of work over all of these years. You kept on believing in what you've done without wavering even a bit. You were able to get here thanks to everything you've done.」


％Ｂ
「If you had even the slightest bit of doubt in your actions, or if you had given up partway through... then I don't think it would've been possible to get to where you are today.」


％Ｂ
「You're seriously amazing, Misa.」
Misa
「Oh no... It's because I had you supporting me. I'm sure I would have broken down partway through without it. Both of our efforts are responsible for this.」


％Ｂ
「Both of our efforts...」
Misa
「...Do you remember what I said, a long time ago?」
％Ｂ
「You mean...?」
Misa
「Since meeting you, in spending time together with you... I learned many important things.」


Misa
「"To believe in myself. To believe in my friends. And... to believe in possibilities."」

Misa
「"I would like to study much more and communicate the wonders of the ocean, and of nature, to many people... I wish to share this wonderful thought with everyone."」


Misa
「"I will no longer hesitate in pursuing that dream"... Do you remember those words?」

％Ｂ
「Yeah... I do. And I made a vow back then too. That I'd always support you... and that I'd always be by your side.」


Misa
「I was able to arrive here only because you were there. Because you stayed true to your word, and you were always by my side, always supporting me...」


Misa
「That is why I was able to arrive here.」
％Ｂ
「Misa...」
Misa
「But this is not the end. This is a new beginning.」

Misa
「As a curator here at Marinpia, I would like to communicate the wonders of the ocean to many, many people... even more than before.」

Misa
「My dream is to make Marinpia Shionagi a wonderful aquarium that can move the hearts of anyone and everyone who walks through the doors.」

％Ｂ
「...That's just like you, Misa.」
Always moving with her dreams in mind.
That's the kind of woman Okihara Misa is.
That's never changed, and never will.
That's why I've decided to always be by her side.
That's right... Always...
％Ｂ
「Then... How about a new beginning for our relationship too?」
Misa
「What? ...What do you mean by that?」
I pull out a small, velvet box from my pocket.
％Ｂ
「...I decided a long time ago that once I was fully qualified... Once I was able to do a true professional's work, I'd give you this.」


Misa
「Is this...?」
％Ｂ
「To be honest, even I don't know if I've really become fully qualified with what I've done.」

％Ｂ
「I still might only be half qualified, and maybe this just happened to go well this time...」

％Ｂ
「But... I still think that this has to be the moment I give you this.」

％Ｂ
「I wasn't able to get something too valuable... but I've packed all of my feelings into this.」

Misa
「...」
％Ｂ
「I want to stay by your side, Misa... I want to keep on supporting you.」

％Ｂ
「That's why I want you to be by my side too. I want you to be there to support me.」

％Ｂ
「I want you... to marry me.」
Misa
「...Hauh.」
I can hear a small gasp.
I sit and wait for her response.
Misa
「As I'm sure you're well aware... I am slightly eccentric. I wasn't quite aware of it when I was a child, but at this point, I have come to realize it slightly.」


Misa
「I'm selfish, and unreasonable, and often complain... but you have been with me regardless ever since high school, close to my heart.」


Misa
「You have loved me from the bottom of your heart... and I am immeasurably grateful to you for that.」

Misa
「And... I, too, love you from the bottom of my heart.」

Misa
「That is why I... also wish to be together with you forever.」

Misa
「I... would like to marry you. I would like to humbly accept your proposal.」

％Ｂ
「...Oh...」
Misa
「Fufu... Could you please place that ring on my finger?」
％Ｂ
「Y-Yeah.」
She gently extends her hand.
With shaking hands, I place the ring on her finger.
On the fourth finger on her left hand.
Misa
「Hauh...」
She stares at the ring dreamily.
It glitters in the light of the jellyfish-rium.
Misa
「...It's wonderful.」
Misa
「U-Ufufufu... This is just too wonderful... It's glittering... reflecting the light from the jellyfish... Aaahh... It's so bright, my vision is blurring...」


Tears fall from her eyes.
The proof of her joy streaks down her cheeks.
Misa
「B-Being together with you... Being together with you forever and ever... is just... unbelievably wonderful...」


Misa
「I'm... so happy!」
％Ｂ
「Whoah!?」
She wraps her arms around me tightly.
The two of us fall onto the sofa.
％Ｂ
「M-Misa... Wha...!?」
％Ｂ
「Um, someone might see us like this...」

Misa
「That doesn't mean a thing!」
Misa
「Because the two of us have just now promised to become husband and wife!」

Misa
「Once we're husband and wife, it's only natural for us to be together even more than before. And holding each other like this... would be a matter of course!」

％Ｂ
「Y-Yeah, that's true...」
Misa
「And... I couldn't possibly hold these feelings in!」
％Ｂ
「O-Oh really... I mean, I'm happy too, of course...」
Misa
「U-Um!」
％Ｂ
「Y-Yes?」
Misa
「I... love you.」
She kisses me.
Misa
「Mmh... chu... nh... fh... Chu!」
％Ｂ
「Mh...」
The jellyfish watch over our passionate, binding kiss.

They drift around us, as if celebrating us.
