Natsuki
「Moooorning!」
％Ｂ
「Morning... You're up early...」
Natsuki wasn't in bed again when I woke up today.
I come down to the living room to find her already changed and getting breakfast ready.

Natsuki
「Because today's the Tanabata Festival I've been waiting for! I've been excited all morning, like I was back in high school!」


％Ｂ
「Wish I could go too.」
Natsuki
「You couldn't possibly ask for a day off to go to a school festival, right?」

％Ｂ
「No... I couldn't...」
I'd definitely get lectured for acting like a high schooler.
Natsuki
「Okay, let's have breakfast. I'll head out as soon as I'm done eating.」

％Ｂ
「Hope you get some good photos.」
Natsuki
「Me too. Could you help me pick out which photo I'll submit to the contest?」

％Ｂ
「Sure thing. I'm looking forward to it.」
Natsuki
「Mhm! Let's eeeaaat!」
all
Azuma
「Dammit... It's so hot...」
％Ｂ
「Please get to work, Teacher.」
Azuma
「How the hell can I work in this damn heat? 
Hey, 
Hino, 

gimme some ice cream. I want ice cream.」
％Ｂ
「You ate all of it yesterday.」
Azuma
「Go buy some, then. I'll give you the money.」
％Ｂ
「I'm fine with buying it, but please do your work when you're done eating, okay?」

％Ｂ
「Whoa... Oh man, it's so hot...」
The sunlight glares down from above.
They were saying on the news that summer was going to be hotter than usual this year, and it looks like they weren't lying.

％Ｂ
「...Wonder if Natsuki's taking tons of photos right now.」
Hope she's not tripping and falling over and stuff because she's so engrossed in her photography. I could see that happening...

％Ｂ
「All right... Let's head to the convenience store.」
％Ｂ
「I'm hoooome.」
Natsuki
「Welcome home! Mmm... chu♪」
Natsuki gives me the usual welcome-home kiss.
Looks like she's in a better mood than usual.
％Ｂ
「How'd it go? Get some good ones?」
Natsuki
「It went perfectly! I got some amazing ones! Can you take a look right away?」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, sure.」
all
Natsuki starts lining the photos she printed out on the table, and then stops.

Natsuki
「Oh... Sorry, what am I doing? I'm a little too excited... We should have dinner first, shouldn't we?」

％Ｂ
「No, I'm fine waiting for dinner. Show me the photos first.」

Natsuki
「Really? Okay then...」
She resumes laying out the photos on the table.
Natsuki
「I narrowed down the candidates a bit before printing them out this time. I took about three hundred total today.」

She's placed about twenty photos down.
Natsuki
「I wanted to narrow things down from here with you.」
％Ｂ
「Got it. But take my opinion with a grain of salt, all right?」
all
I take a good look at the photos.
There's one of some female students smiling as they advertise for a display.
Male students messing around and having a good time with their friends.
Guests smiling as they look at the festival displays.
Everyone's got genuine smiles on their faces, without paying any mind to the camera.
They're all wonderful "smiles with friends."
Natsuki
「Which one do you think is the best?」
％Ｂ
「Hmm... Tough question. They're all good smiles. Which one's your favorite?」

Natsuki
「Mine iiis...」
％Ｂ
「Wait a second. How about we both point to our personal favorite on the count of three?」
Natsuki
「Sounds good to me. Okay then, one, two... three!」
We both point at the photo we each think is best at the same time.
Natsuki
「Oh...」
％Ｂ
「Oh...」
We've both pointed to the same photo.
It's a photo of a group of male and female students wearing event committee armbands, standing in a ring and high-fiving with huge smiles.

The event committee members must have high-fived from sheer happiness after seeing the success of the Tanabata Festival... or at least, that's my guess for what the context is.


％Ｂ
「I guess this is the one, then.」
Natsuki
「I took this one 'cause it kinda reminded me of you guys back then. Their faces look a bit like the people back then too.」


％Ｂ
「You think so?」
Natsuki
「Here, like this boy. Don't you think he looks like Nirasawa? And this girl's a bit like Marika.」

％Ｂ
「Oh yeah... Now that you mention it... Think anyone here looks like me, then?」

Natsuki
「One who looks like you... This one, maybe?」
％Ｂ
「...Does he look like me? Don't you think I'm a bit more... sharp-looking?」

Natsuki
「No way, you were more like this back then... Though I feel bad for the boy in the photo for saying things like that.」

％Ｂ
「Whoa, don't you think this girl looks super cute?」
Natsuki
「Oh, I heard she's the student council president. She's got the best grades in her year, she's good at sports, and she's got big boobs too, so she's apparently the most popular girl in the school.」


％Ｂ
「Seriously? We never had a super-popular pretty student council president like that.」

Natsuki
「No, we didn't. But we did have a super-popular pretty grad-alb committee member.」

％Ｂ
「...Did we?」
Natsuki
「She's right here in front of you.」
％Ｂ
「I can't believe you just called yourself super popular.」
Natsuki
「Huh? But I was pretty popular, you know.」
％Ｂ
「Were you?」
Natsuki
「I was confessed to five times, you know.」
％Ｂ
「Wha...!? I've never heard anything about that!」
Natsuki
「'Cause it's my first time saying it. I said no right away to four of them.」

％Ｂ
「Y-You said yes to one of them??」
Natsuki
「Mhm. And we're still together, aren't we?」
％Ｂ
「...Oh.」
Natsuki
「What do you think? You see how lucky you are now? Feeling grateful?」

％Ｂ
「Y-Yeah...」
Natsuki
「Mm, very good. Though I'm even more grateful than you are.」

％Ｂ
「Huh? What's that mean?」
Natsuki
「Mmm... How do I say it...? I'm pretty sure I'd be living a different life from the one I'm living now if I hadn't met you
, Ryousuke

.」

Natsuki
「I don't think I would've started working where I am now, and I don't think I would've been married at this age either. Though I still might've been happy that way.」


Natsuki
「But I really like my life right now. I can take photos as my job, and I'm married. I have lots of friends still too.」


Natsuki
「I think I'm living a genuinely wonderful life right now. And I think you're the one who let me pick this life

, Ryousuke

.」
Natsuki
「I met you, I started dating you, I married you... I don't think it'd be exaggerating to say that I have the life I do now only because you've always been by my side
, Ryousuke

」










Natsuki
「So... I'll say it properly, because I've been wanting to. Thank you

, Ryousuke

. For giving me happiness... and for making my life this wonderful. Thank you so much!」

％Ｂ
「Natsuki...」
I hadn't expected Natsuki to say anything like that.
I had absolutely no idea that she thought of our relationship that way.
And she just had to say it at a time like this...
Crap... I think I might cry...
Natsuki
「I may be the way I am, but I will continue to be in your care from now on.」
％Ｂ
「L-Likewise... I'll also be in your care.」
We both bow our heads low to each other.
Natsuki
「...Feels kinda weird, doesn't it! Ehehe.」
％Ｂ
「Y-Yeah... Haha...」
Natsuki
「...」
％Ｂ
「...」
We look into each other's eyes, and find ourselves drawn together into a kiss.
Natsuki
「Mm... chu... Nh... fh...」
