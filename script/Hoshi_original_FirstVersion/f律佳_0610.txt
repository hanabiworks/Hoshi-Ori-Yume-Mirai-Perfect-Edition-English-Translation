「Hmm～」
I've taken a step forward, but I'm not at the finish line just yet.
I'm stewing over thinking about the person who sits next to me, who's gone off somewhere for break, when...

Natsuki
「What's going on? Holding it in? Why don't you just go to the bathroom then?」
％Ｂ
「No. I'm thinking about something. A girl shouldn't say such things.」
Natsuki
「What are you thinking about?」
I dunno if I'll be able to figure this out by myself, so maybe I should ask Segawa for some advice.

％Ｂ
「About Narusawa.」
Natsuki
「So you want to feel the lingering warmth of her butt from her chair while she's gone!」

％Ｂ
「My bad. I was stupid for thinking I could go to you for advice. Just forget I said anything.」
Natsuki
「Now wait just one second. It was just a joke. I'll listen seriously, so tell me what's going on.」

％Ｂ
「Mm, then I'll tell you...」
all
I glance at the classroom door to make sure Narusawa isn't here.
I turn back toward Segawa.
％Ｂ
「I asked Narusawa if she wanted to join the committee yesterday.」
Natsuki
「She said no, didn't she?」
％Ｂ
「Yep. She told me she was alone 'cause that's what she wanted.」
％Ｂ
「But I saw her smiling like she was having fun when we all went out camping together.」

Natsuki
「So you wanna be together with Rikka more to see her smile?」
She smiles at me teasingly.
％Ｂ
「Yeah, I guess I do...」
Natsuki
「Oh geez, you're going to admit it? That's not fun～」
％Ｂ
「What, you don't want your friends to smile too?」
Natsuki
「Well of course I do. It's more fun for me to see Rikka smiling like in that photo from before too, instead of that usual sour look she makes.」


％Ｂ
「I know that I'm just being selfish, and that it might just be bothersome for Narusawa.」

％Ｂ
「But I just keep thinking about it, and the more I think about it, the less I understand.」

Natsuki
「You've got a real unfortunate personality, you know that?」
％Ｂ
「Do I?」
I've had this personality all my life, so I can't really tell.
Natsuki
「Well... I understand the situation now! It'll all be solved if you let me handle everything!」

Natsuki
「Project design, me! Strategy advising, me! A Segawa production on all fronts!」

％Ｂ
「W-Well, if you really wanna, then sure...」
I ended up nodding in the moment, but with the way she's acting...
It's just plain worrying. Is this going to be okay?
I guess I'll just believe in her, since I've already said I'll let her handle it...
all
Natsuki
「The "let's become closer with Rikka" project! Yay!」
％Ｂ
「...」
Seeing Segawa jump around and pump her fists in the air in excitement makes me think one thing.

...I might've been right to be worried.
Natsuki
「Get into it more! Yay!」
％Ｂ
「...Yaaay～」
Natsuki
「What? Don't you wanna get closer with her? Don't you wanna enjoy after-school hours?」

I wanna! Yay!
I've got committee stuff to do now, so...
％Ｂ
「I wanna! Yay!」
Since I do actually wanna get closer with her.
Arghh, I already told Segawa I'd let her handle things anyway. I'll just go with it!

Natsuki
「That's the spirit! Yay! Yay!」
％Ｂ
「Yay! Yay!」
Natsuki
「You're getting into it now! Yay! Yay! Yay!」
％Ｂ
「Yay, yay, yay! ...This is seriously embarrassing, so can we stop already?」

％Ｂ
「I've got committee stuff to do, so...」
Natsuki
「And you think you can call yourself an earnest young man celebrating his youth!?」
％Ｂ
「I think focusing on my committee work's a perfectly respectable way to do that.」
Natsuki
「Pouring your sweat into your committee work... as another form of enjoying your youth. Yes, yes! Fine, yes, I'll acknowledge that!」

She holds her right hand up as if to protest, makes a fist with her left hand and places it against her chest, and twists her body and hands around in an exaggerated fashion as she begins her sermon.

Natsuki
「But you see, you see! I want you to think this through! Deepening your bonds of friendship is just as valuable! Friendship and peace!」


％Ｂ
「You just wanted to say "friendship and peace."」

And that sounded terrible.
Natsuki
「Now then, we're going to go chase down our springtimes of youth!」
％Ｂ
「I haven't said a word about coming with...」
...I guess she isn't listening.
Segawa, all smiles, jauntily places her hands on Narusawa's desk as the latter's getting ready to leave.

Natsuki
「So, Rikka! Let's go do karaoke!」
Rikka
「No.」
Natsuki
「Hmhmh, I thought you'd say that. But shouldn't you at least hear us out for manners' sake?」

Rikka
「I don't have to even try to overhear you two talking like that right next to me... I'm fine. Go by yourselves.」

Natsuki
「There's no point going without you. Don't you know what a social event is?」
Rikka
「I have no intention of socializing.」
Natsuki
「You're going to regret it, you know. It'll be too late by the time you're crying, "I wish I had gone～"」

Rikka
「I won't regret it, and I won't cry about it.」
Yeah...
all
There's no way she would...
％Ｂ
「...」
She wouldn't... right?
Natsuki
「You've left us with no choice. You grab her right hand.」

％Ｂ
「What?」
Natsuki
「I'll take her left hand.」
％Ｂ
「Wha... You don't mean...?」
Natsuki
「We're kidnapping her!」
％Ｂ
「I knew it!」
Segawa's already got both of her hands on Narusawa's left arm.

She's looking at me, signaling for me to do the same.
I-Is this really okay?
％Ｂ
「...」
％Ｂ
「Sorry, Narusawa.」
Rikka
「Wait, wha... Why are you apologizing and grabbing me!?」

W-Wow...
Narusawa's upper arm is soft...
I'm taken aback at how it feels.
％Ｂ
「I can't go against my own wishes.」
Natsuki
「I've got your bag too. Okay, now let's go～」
We lift her up from both sides and stand her up.
Rikka
「Wha, no! ...Let go of me!」
Natsuki
「Prepare yourself.」
Rikka
「Why do I have to prepare myself...!? I already said I wasn't going!」

Natsuki
「Okaaay～ We have now arrived at Mega-Kara, my karaoke place of choice～!」

％Ｂ
「Ohh, so this is the famed Mega-Kara! What a regal establishment!」

Rikka
「...It's just a normal building.」
I can hear a sigh from beside me as I'm playing along with Segawa.
Narusawa's slumped over after being dragged all the way to the marketplace.
Rikka
「I won't run away, so let go of me.」
Natsuki
「Okay, release and go! I'll go in and get us a room～」
Rikka
「Sigh... You and Segawa-san sure have strange tastes. Bringing me along isn't going to make it any more fun.」

％Ｂ
「I don't think that's true. I wanna hear you sing.」
Rikka
「I've never sung before.」
％Ｂ
「Huh? Is this your first time doing karaoke?」
Rikka
「It is. I've never gone before. Karaoke's something you do with lots of other people, isn't it?」

％Ｂ
「That's usually the case, but people do solo-kara too.」
Rikka
「Solo-kara?」
％Ｂ
「You go sing a ton by yourself.」
Rikka
「People do pointless things, don't they?」
％Ｂ
「Apologize to all the solo-karaists of the world.」
％Ｂ
「But okay, so today's your first time doing karaoke. I'll teach you lots of stuff.」

Rikka
「Everything you say sounds so obscene. I think I might leave after all.」
％Ｂ
「That wasn't on purpose just now. But I'm sorry.」
I bet Segawa would yell my ear off if I let her leave at this point.
％Ｂ
「Anyway, let's go in. Don't wanna keep Segawa waiting.」
We might not have to wait for a room, since school only just ended.

％Ｂ
「Oh, I know. Just so you know, I'm not great at singing.」

％Ｂ
「I like doing karaoke, but my friends laugh at me a lot.」
Rikka
「Hehe. Now that I'm looking forward to.」
Oh, she laughed.
Rikka
「Let's go.」
Natsuki
「Ahhh～ We sang a ton～ ...My voice is totally gone.」
By the time we leave karaoke, the sky's changing from orange to dusky blue.
Of course, it was pretty much a Segawa live show all the way through.
But I'm just glad that she made things exciting on her own.
Natsuki
「You two should've sung more...」
％Ｂ
「That much was fine with me.」

Rikka
「Same for me.」
Narusawa sang―or more like she was forced to sing just one song by Segawa.
I didn't know what the lyrics meant, since it was some foreign song...
But her voice was clear like a river, and gentle.
％Ｂ
「...And you were totally cracking up when I sang.」
Segawa was rolling with laughter, swinging the maracas away while I was doing my aria.

Narusawa was tapping a tambourine that Segawa handed her, looking like she didn't really know what to do.

Natsuki
「I'll be going, then. You make sure you walk Rikka home. See you tomorrow～」

％Ｂ
「Uh, hey. What about you?」
Natsuki
「I'll be fine, 'cause I live right around here! Thanks for worrying. I'll leave Rikka to you～」

She smiles brightly and runs off, waving goodbye vigorously as she goes.

％Ｂ
「All right, I guess we should get going too.」
Rikka
「It isn't as dark as last time, so I can go home by myself.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, but there's been some dangerous stuff happening even while it's light out recently, and...」
Rikka
「You'd regret it for the rest of your life if something happened to me?」

％Ｂ
「Oh, you already know!」
Rikka
「...Just come with. It'd be bothersome and tiring if you just kept following me like this.」

Rikka
「There won't be any issues. This area isn't dangerous.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, you didn't know that there was a molester in the streets near these parts the other day?」

Rikka
「Wha...? Was there really?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. I guess there might not be a lot of people who know, 'cause it was just a small local piece of news I saw on a news site.」

Rikka
「...」
She stops, looking a little unsure.
I guess even she's afraid of things like molesters.
Let's not tell her that the molester was caught right away after that.\n\r
It's totally plausible that a similar crimes could happen anyway.
％Ｂ
「So yeah, I'll walk you home.」
I start walking, and she reluctantly follows. Looks like it worked.

I walk alongside her, matching her pace.
I try talking to her, but she only ever gives the absolute minimum response.
Conversation doesn't really happen.
And my not particularly abundant vocabulary is about at its limit.

Rikka
「...」
Narusawa's looking off to the side.
At a small park.
There are kids running around, chasing after a soccer ball.
％Ｂ
「Huh... Soccer. That takes me back.」
I remember I used to get covered in scratches and dirt playing soccer until sundown too.

％Ｂ
「Shuuichi would trip and say I fouled him on purpose, and we'd get in fights and stuff...」

Rikka
「How savage. Is that common for boys?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. Though they were just kids' fights, so we made up the next day.」

％Ｂ
「It might've been a ritual for becoming better friends... Stuff like that.」
Rikka
「Hmm... Boys are strange.」
She's still staring at the kids in the park.
Rikka
「Oh... There's a girl there too. Isn't it dangerous, running around like that?」

％Ｂ
「Oh yeah, there was a girl like that for us too.」
Rikka
「Shinozaki-san?」
％Ｂ
「No, Shinozaki was sick back then, so she almost never came out to play with us. But how'd you know we knew each other back then?」


Rikka
「She told me when we went camping. She was very grateful to you for all you had done for her back then.」

％Ｂ
「I didn't really do that much, though. I just visited her when she was too sick for school, and talked to her so she wouldn't be bored.」

Rikka
「It isn't uncommon for something you don't think much of to mean a lot to the person on the receiving end.」

％Ｂ
「That's true. I've got experience with that myself.」
％Ｂ
「Either way, all that matters is that Shinozaki's better now.」
Rikka
「I'm sure that you helped Shinozaki-san become the Shinozaki-san she is today.」

Her voice is bright.
％Ｂ
「You know, continuing where we left off, guys just stop hanging out with girls once they're around high school age, don't they?」


Rikka
「Why is that?」
％Ｂ
「Guys and girls just start recognizing each other as members of the opposite sex around then. That's around when girls start looking more like girls, you know?」

％Ｂ
「Knowing that they're girls and they're different from you suddenly makes hanging out with them embarrassing.」

Rikka
「Hmm...」
She sounds as if she doesn't quite believe it.
all
Girl A
「Kyaahhh!?」
The girl pitches forward and falls as she runs.
Rikka
「! ...Is she okay? She fell really hard...」
％Ｂ
「Don't worry, she's fine. Just watch, you'll see.」
all
The girl remains sitting, tearing up while holding her knee. The boys immediately run up to her.

The boys talk to her a bit, and the girl immediately brightens, gets up, and starts running with them.

Rikka
「Thank goodness... Seems she was fine.」
She breathes out what sounds like a genuine sigh of relief.
％Ｂ
「It happens a lot. You've never fallen like that when you were playing with others?」

I look at Narusawa, and our eyes meet.
She narrows her eyes sadly and looks at the kids again.
Rikka
「I'm... not familiar with playing like that.」
％Ｂ
「You mean you've never played with friends?」
Rikka
「No, I haven't. I've never played at the park, or gone to karaoke like we did today, nothing... Piano was everything back when I was a child.」

Rikka
「When I had school, I'd go home right away to play piano. I had lessons from morning until night on weekends... I didn't have time to play, and I didn't have anyone I could call a friend.」


％Ｂ
「...」
Rikka
「But I've never been dissatisfied with that, or found it restrictive.」

Rikka
「I was born into a household that played the piano, and I myself decided to start playing piano... That's all. If anything, I was blessed from the perspective of learning piano.」


She says that, but her expression has a hint of doubt in it.

I'm sure Narusawa's telling the truth.
But I feel like she's not telling me everything.
I don't know much about her.
I don't know what she thinks while she plays piano by herself.
I don't know why she lives here alone, even though her parents and younger sister are overseas.\n\r

There are a ton of things I don't know.
That's why...
I want to learn, even if it's just a little at a time.
％Ｂ
「Wanna come hang out with me again sometime?」
Rikka
「Are you actually hitting on me this time?」
％Ｂ
「No, I'm not. I just wanna hang out, no ulterior motives.」
Rikka
「Just us two?」
％Ｂ
「With Segawa, and Shinozaki and the others too.」
Rikka
「Really. I'll decline, then.」
％Ｂ
「...Huh?」
What does that...?
It takes me more than a few moments before I realize the implication.
％Ｂ
「Wha... What!?」
Wait, so does that mean she'd come if it were just the two of us?
Which means that Narusawa wants to go on a date with me?
Wait, does Narusawa...?
％Ｂ
「Th-Then... do you wanna hang out with just us two?」
Rikka
「...So you do have ulterior motives.」
％Ｂ
「Agh, you're the worst! You tricked me! You can't just play with a man's heart like that!」

Rikka
「What a scandalous way of putting it. I was just testing you. I can't believe you'd fall for it a second time.」

％Ｂ
「I have no words to defend myself with...」
％Ｂ
「But I bet any guy would say the same thing if he heard something like that.」
Rikka
「What a scandalous way of putting it. I was just testing you. It's your fault for falling for it at all.」

％Ｂ
「Well yeah, but I bet any guy would say the same thing if he heard something like that.」

Rikka
「I guess you'll just have to regret being a boy then, hehe... Here is fine.」

％Ｂ
「What?」
Rikka
「Because we're here.」
We're suddenly in front of Narusawa's apartment complex.
I didn't even realize we had arrived.
％Ｂ
「Huh, so this is where you live.」
It's a pretty impressive looking complex...
I can't see the top without pitching backward.
How many floors are there?
Rikka
「I hope you're not actually planning something now that you've figured out where I live.」

％Ｂ
「I'm not!」
％Ｂ
「See you tomorrow, then.」
Rikka
「See you.」
all
I watch Narusawa as she walks away.
She has an upright, graceful way of walking.
Her silky hair flutters neatly behind her.
And then...
Her hair sways to the side.
She turns to me, and...
Rikka
「...Thank you. For walking me home again. Good night.」
Rikka
「...Thank you. For walking me home. Good night.」
Shows me a soft... and very gentle smile.
％Ｂ
「S-Sure.」
all
She then disappears into the apartment complex.
It was so sudden it made me stutter.
I wonder if she thought I was weird.
I put my hand up to my pounding chest.
I feel a comfortable rhythm.
％Ｂ
「Pheeew～ ...I'm exhausted～」
I lay myself down. I feel nice and tired.
I know. I should thank Segawa.
【％Ｂ】「Thanks for setting #Nthings up today. The #Nkaraoke was fun too.」
I don't have to wait too long for a reply.
【Natsuki】「Good, you're being #Nhonest!」
【Natsuki】「So how were things with #NRikka after that? Did #Nyou at least get tea?」
【％Ｂ】「We didn't do anything. #NWe went home right #Nafter.」
【Natsuki】「What are you doing!? I #Nwas being sooo #Nconsiderate too～!」
【Natsuki】_st_0204
％Ｂ
「...What?」
She was being considerate?
As in...?
【％Ｂ】「You don't think I like #NNarusawa, do you?」
【Natsuki】「What else could it even #Nbe?」
【％Ｂ】「She's just a friend?」
【Natsuki】「So you'll invite just #Nany friend to the #Ncommittee?」
Well, when she puts it that way...
Why do I want to do so much for Narusawa?

【％Ｂ】「I wonder what it means #Nto be in love.」
【Natsuki】「Hard pass on the #Nphilosophy talk.」
【Natsuki】_st_0209
【％Ｂ】「That's not what I mean. #NI've never dated anyone #Nor seriously fallen in #Nlove before.」
【Natsuki】「That's rare for people #Nour age. Though it's #Nthe same for me.」
【％Ｂ】「So I don't really know #Nmyself how I feel about #NNarusawa.」
【Natsuki】「You mean whether you #Nlike her as a friend or #Nas a girl?」
【％Ｂ】「That's what I mean, #Nyeah.」
I'm lost in a bunch of confusing and conflicting emotions, as if the pieces of a huge jigsaw puzzle have been strewn out before me.

【％Ｂ】「Besides, isn't it weird #Nto feel that way about #Nsomeone just a week #Nafter getting to know #Nthem?」
【Natsuki】「It isn't. Love at first #Nsight's a thing. I know #Nlots of couples who #Nstarted out that way #Nand are still together.」
【Natsuki】「I think you and Rikka #Nare gonna get together.」
【％Ｂ】「On what basis?」
【Natsuki】「A woman's intuition.」
【％Ｂ】「So no basis at all, #Nthen.」
【Natsuki】「There may be no basis, #Nbut I know my stuff.」
Narusawa and me, huh...
Even if I do like Narusawa, Narusawa liking me is... Well that's just impossible, isn't it?

She's so pretty, and she can cook too. I bet she's popular enough as it is.
【％Ｂ】「Well, whatever. Anyway, #Nthanks for today. We #Nshould all hang out #Nagain sometime.」
【Natsuki】「Natch!」
【％Ｂ】「And I'll try getting #NNarusawa to join the #Ncommittee again.」
【Natsuki】「That so. Well, good #Nluck with that.」
【％Ｂ】_st_0307

％Ｂ
「...Right. I'll give it my all tomorrow too.」
I turn off the lights and pull my sheets over myself.
％Ｂ
「Night～」
