Today is the final day of exams.
Club and committee activities finally resume after we finish our last set of tests.

$$smh_OpenCHK
Sora and I immediately go to Yamashita-sensei to turn in a request to extend club hours.

％Ｂ
「Excuse us.」
Sora
「...Excuse.」
％Ｂ
「Now we can see the stars together again.」
Sora
「...*nod* I'm excited.」
She smiles happily.
And I'm happy that she's so honest about the way she feels around me now.

But first, we need to go to the event committee office to discuss the planetarium.

％Ｂ
「Heeey. Oh, we're the last ones here. Sorry for making you all wait.」
Everyone other than Sora and me is already here.
Marika
「It's okay. We haven't been waiting that long.」

Touko
「I was planning on going home, actually. But Jellyfish-senpai found me.」

all
Misa
「Did you do fine on your exams?」
％Ｂ
「Yes, thanks to the notes I borrowed from Narusawa. Thanks again, Narusawa.」

Rikka
「You don't have to thank me so many times. All I did was let you copy off my notes.」

Everyone seems bright and happy now that exams are over.
all
...Almost everyone, at least.
Shuuichi and Segawa are silently staring off into the distance over in the corner...
...Not commenting would probably be the kind thing to do.
％Ｂ
「Uh, right, anyway, I've got some news.」
Shuuichi
「Aahh...? The last math questiooon? That was y = 8.」
Natsuki
「What are you taaalking abooout? It was y = 12, ooobviously...」

Rikka
「That was y = 5.」
Marika
「Mhm, I think it was 5.」
all
Shuuichi
「Guooooooooohhhhhhhhhh!」
all
Natsuki
「Aaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh!」
They clutch their heads and twist around.
Thank god. I got y = 5 too.
％Ｂ
「Wait a second... Shuuichi, Segawa... You two didn't fail, did you?」
Shuuichi
「...Don't worry... All that means is that I know I got just one problem wrong.」

Natsuki
「That's right. All that means is my 100's a 99 now.」
Uh, no... It's not one point per question...
％Ｂ
「...By the way, that first multiple-choice question was B, right?」
Rikka
「What else could it be?」
all
Shuuichi
「Guoooooooooooohhhhhhhh!」
all
Natsuki
「Aaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhh!」
We all sit down after the two of them are done screaming.
％Ｂ
「Now then, there's something I want to discuss with all of you. It's about what the astronomy club's going to do for the Tanabata Festival. We still want to do the planetarium.」


Shuuichi
「Have you found a way to get around the cost issue?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. We'll start with the dome. We're thinking of making it ourselves.」

Marika
「Making it your... Can you do that?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. I looked it up on the internet, and I ended up finding a lot of people who made planetarium domes themselves for culture festivals and stuff. But the projector's gonna have to be a rental for sure.」


Shuuichi
「How are you gonna pay for that? Didn't you say a projector was 70,000 on its own?」

％Ｂ
「We're thinking of getting the money together through working part-time.」
all
Touko
「What? You're going to get a job?」
Shuuichi
「So that's your plan...」
％Ｂ
「We're allowed to get jobs at our school, right?」
all
Shuuichi
「We are, but... do you even have the time for a part-time job? We're short enough on time to prepare for the festival as it is, you know.」

％Ｂ
「It'll be me and Sora working. We're only doing it for the projector rental fee, so it won't take too long if both of us are working.」

Sora
「...*nod*」
Shuuichi
「Why don't you come up with a different idea for what to do instead of going that far?」

％Ｂ
「Because we do want to go that far.」
Shuuichi
「Hmm... Sure, but...」
all
Marika
「Umm～ What if I worked too? Three people working would get the money together that much sooner, right?」

Natsuki
「I'll do it too, then.」
Touko
「Mmm... It's a pain, but it's not like I have anything better to do anyway. I might be into doing it if it's something interesting.」

all
Rikka
「I think we'd be able to get the money together in just a few days with this many people.」
Misa
「It's wonderful to accomplish something together with everyone. I would also love to participate in this effort.」

％Ｂ
「Thanks, everyone. But to be honest... I'd feel bad about relying on you guys for money-related things. So I wanna ask you guys to help with something else.」


all
Marika
「Something else?」
％Ｂ
「I want you guys to get the cardboard together for making the dome.」
％Ｂ
「We still have to do the math for how much we'll need exactly, but it'd be great if you could gather it up.」

Sora
「...A six-meter-diameter dome would be ideal.」
all
Rikka
「Six meters in diameter... You're going to need a lot.」
Touko
「So what you're saying just getting the cardboard together's going to be a lot of work.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. That's why we wanna ask you all for your help.」
all
Marika
「Mhm, okay. I'll go all around the marketplace for cardboard.」
Misa
「I will also search wherever I can think of.」
Natsuki
「That's how this seems to be going, Nirasawa. So is the event committee going to okay the astronomy club doing that?」

all
Shuuichi
「I'd end up as the villain if I said no at this point. And it's 

Ryousuke 
this guy 
we're talking about. There's no way he thought of a plan B like I asked.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, you'd be right.」
Shuuichi
「That's just the kinda guy he is. If he decides to do something, then that's that. He seriously hasn't changed since grade school.」

all
He sighs and pulls a folder labeled "Tanabata Festival 2014" out from a filing cabinet.


He pulls out a sheaf of papers of each club's display for the festival─and stamps "Approved" on the astronomy club's application.

％Ｂ
「Looks to me like that paperwork had "planetarium" written on it from the start.」

Shuuichi
「Not like I thought it was going to change.」
His smile looks exasperated, but also satisfied for some reason.
Shuuichi
「Anyway, have a detailed plan for me by the beginning of next week. Know how much cardboard you'll need, as well as your budget including the rental fee for the projector. I'll help as much as I can too.」


％Ｂ
「What? But you've got your own work as the event committee chair, don't you?」
Shuuichi
「I put the newcomer in charge, so I need to make sure it's done right. I don't want people questioning my management abilities.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, sure. Of course you do. Anyway, got it. We'll be counting on you too.」

all
Sora and I turn and give each other a thumbs-up.
all
Sora and I carry the telescope up to the roof after getting through the event committee meeting.\n\r

It's our first time doing astronomy club stuff in a while.
％Ｂ
「The weather's nice. We'll probably be able to see the stars pretty well tonight.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
Sora sets the telescope up under the still-bright, blue sky.
％Ｂ
「...This makes me feel kinda nostalgic.」
Sora
「...Nostalgic?」
％Ｂ
「It's only been two weeks, but doing this again makes me feel nostalgic.」
Sora
「...I had to wait for two whole weeks.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah... It's something you usually do every day, after all.」
Sora
「...*shake shake*」
％Ｂ
「Hm?」
Sora
「...I can watch the stars at home. I had to wait to watch the stars together with you

, Ryou

.」
％Ｂ
「Sora...」
all
I glance at the door.
I walk up to Sora after confirming that no one's coming up the stairs.

Sora
「...」
I hug Sora from behind as she's looking through the telescope.
Sora
「...!??」
She goes bolt upright in surprise.
But she relaxes immediately once she realizes it's me.
Sora
「...What's wrong?」
％Ｂ
「Well... I dunno. We're boyfriend and girlfriend, so I thought we could do stuff like this too.」

Sora
「...I see.」
Sora places her own hand on my arm that's around her.
Sora
「...I think so too.」
％Ｂ
「That's good... Can we stay like this for a little longer then?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
We stayed like that for a while.
all
Sora's referencing a compass as she meticulously adjusts the bearing of the telescope as the sun goes down.

The lens is pointing pretty low.
I thought she might be looking at the sea again, but it looks like it's pointing at the mountains.
％Ｂ
「What's over there?」
Sora
「...」
Sora just silently continues to adjust the telescope. I can't tell if she ignored me or if she's too focused to have heard me.

She pulls her phone out and starts making a call.
She puts her phone up to her ear, but she's not saying anything.
％Ｂ
「What's she doing...?」
Sora
「...Mm.」
She quirks her finger at the eyepiece.
I guess she wants me to look through.
Sora
「...Hurry.」
％Ｂ
「R-Right...」
She's rushing me for once.
all
I hurry up to the telescope to look.
％Ｂ
「...I can't see anything.」
All I can see is a mountain and the darkening sky.
Sora
「...Five.」
％Ｂ
「Huh?」
Sora
「...Four... Three... Two...」
Sh-She's counting down to something.
What am I gonna see?
Sora
「...One...」
Gulp...
Sora
「...Zero.」
The next instant, something cuts through the telescope's field of view.
％Ｂ
「Whoa!? Wh-What was that just now!? Was it a UFO!?」
Sora
「...The ISS.」
％Ｂ
「ISS? I've heard of that.」
Sora
「The International Space Station. It's a manned experimental laboratory. The ISS orbits approximately 400 kilometers above Earth's surface at the rate of about one full revolution every ninety minutes.」

％Ｂ
「That's the one that Japanese astronauts have been in too, right?」

Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「Wow, I didn't know you could see the ISS with a telescope.」
Sora
「...You can see it with the naked eye with the right timing.」
％Ｂ
「Really... I guess space is closer than I thought.」
Sora
「...That was a good line just now.」
％Ｂ
「Wha? You think so?」
Sora
「...Hearing you say that makes me happy.」
And seeing her smile at me makes me happy in turn.
all
Nighttime falls entirely, and the stars begin twinkling above us.
Tonight is yet another stargazing event that Sora's putting on exclusively for me.

Sora
「...Do you remember how I talked about Ophiuchus before?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah... Back when you made those cookies.」
Sora
「...Scutum is next to Aquila's left wing. The long pentagon to the right of that is Ophiuchus.」

％Ｂ
「You said Ophiuchus and Serpens were two linked constellations, right?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
Sora
「Zeus's son Apollo had a child named Asclepius. Asclepius was an excellent doctor, and the snake was his symbol.」


％Ｂ
「Why was the snake his symbol?」
Sora
「...One story says it was because Asclepius learned about medicinal herbs from a snake. Another says that it was because he used snake venom to make medicine.」


Sora
「Whatever the case, Asclepius was renowned for his skills as a doctor. He eventually became skilled enough to bring back the dead.」


％Ｂ
「Wow, that's amazing. He was past the level of being a doctor at that point.」
Sora
「But that skill earned him the wrath of Hades, god of the underworld. And so Asclepius was struck and killed by Zeus's lightning.」

％Ｂ
「Old man Zeus is as terrible as ever...」



Sora
「After that, Asclepius was placed in the night sky as a constellation in deference to his achievements as a doctor. That's Ophiuchus.」

％Ｂ
「I get it. So that's why he's holding a snake. 'Cause it's his symbol.」

Sora
「...That's right.」
The stories behind constellations are always so interesting.
I bet lots of people could become interested in constellations if they heard these stories.

It's just another reason for us to make the planetarium a reality.

all
％Ｂ
「Phew...」
I roll my head on my neck a bit as I look up at the sky.
Sora immediately kneels on the ground, as if she had been waiting for this very moment.

Sora
「...Mm.」
She pats her lap.
It's her signaling that she's readied her special seat for me.

I haven't gotten a lap pillow from her like this in two weeks now.
％Ｂ
「'Scuse me, then...」
all
I start to lay my head down on her thighs like always―and then get up and walk around behind her.

Sora
「...? ...??」
I sit behind her while she's confused and hug her tight from behind, enveloping her with my body.

％Ｂ
「Lap pillows are nice, but I thought doing something like this could be nice every now and then too.」
Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「You think stargazing like this is okay...?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
Sora
「...I think so.」
She leans against me.
She turns around against my shoulder and smiles.
I kiss her gently.
Sora
「...Mm...～～～mh... nh...」
It's our first kiss in so long, beneath a starry sky.
I just can't take how precious she is, here in my arms.
We quietly watch the stars above, enjoying each other's warmth.
Sora's voice sounds happier than usual as she talks about myths and legends from within my arms.

Sora
「...Mmh...～～～...nh... Nnh... mmph...」
I remember something after we kiss for the... actually, I've lost count how many times.
％Ｂ
「...Hey... Wanna come over tomorrow?」
Sora
「...To your house?」



％Ｂ
「Yeah. Remember how Shuuichi told us to have the details down for the planetarium? I figured we could do that at my place.」

Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「Oh, we can do it somewhere else too. Like a family restaurant or a burger place...」

Sora
「...*shake shake*」
Sora
「...I'm not against it.」
％Ｂ
「Wanna come over, then?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「Okay. Great.」
We kiss again.
I'm looking forward to tomorrow.
