「Let's get lunch, Segawa.」
Natsuki
「Mmm? Lunchtime already?」
％Ｂ
「What are you spacing out for? Aren't you gonna eat?」
Natsuki
「Mmm...」
all
She slowly pulls out her camera as she gives a halfhearted response.

％Ｂ
「Oh, come on... Don't just start messing with your camera when I'm trying to get you to eat lunch with me...」

Natsuki
「Mmm...」
This is pointless...
％Ｂ
「I'm gonna go to the cafeteria by myself, then.」
I turn around and start walking, but then she grabs the back of my shirt.

％Ｂ
「What the heck?」
Natsuki
「Hey... What do you think about this?」
all
She shows me her camera's screen.
It's one of the photos she took of the fish last week.
％Ｂ
「What do you mean... I think it's a good photo.」
Natsuki
「Yeah... It's a good photo... but there's just something about it...」

％Ｂ
「Something about it...? It's not like it's blurry or anything, and you can see the fish's colors properly, so I don't think there's any problem with it.」

Natsuki
「Yeah, but... Hmm...」
％Ｂ
「Senpai and Shinozaki thought they were great too, remember? Is there really something wrong with it?」

Natsuki
「I'm saying there's something about it because I don't know what it is.」
％Ｂ
「Sounds pretty rough... Anyway, I'm gonna go eat lunch.」
Natsuki
「Mmmmmm... I can't figure out what's tripping me up about this～」
％Ｂ
「...If you're okay with bread for lunch, want me to buy you some?」
Natsuki
「Mmm～ ...Melon bread and an egg sandwich... and strawberry milk.」
％Ｂ
「Got it.」
She seems pretty bothered about this.
I'm sure she hates compromising when it comes to photography, but I don't think it's good to get too obsessed either...

all
％Ｂ
「I got you what you wanted.」
Natsuki
「Thanks... Hmmmm...」
％Ｂ
「Eat your food.」
Natsuki
「...Nnnnghhh! I'm so hot and bothereeeed!」
％Ｂ
「You mean just bothered. The guys are looking at us weird...」

％Ｂ
「Ugh. Give me that camera for a second.」
Natsuki
「Hm? Okay, I think it might be nice to hear an ordinary person's opinion.」
％Ｂ
「Sorry to disappoint you, but I think I might be a bit different from ordinary.」
all
My goal is to be an architect.
I'd like to think I have at least a little appreciation for aesthetics.
─But.
％Ｂ
「...They're all good photos.」
Natsuki
「Sigh... You got me a little excited and everything...」
％Ｂ
「I dunno what else to say, though...」
all
I continue looking through the photos.
％Ｂ
「Hm...?」
Natsuki
「Something wrong?」
％Ｂ
「No... I was just thinking that this photo in particular's really good compared to the rest.」
Natsuki
「Which one?」
％Ｂ
「The one you took yesterday. Of the sparrow nest behind the old school building.」
I show Segawa the screen.
Natsuki
「Oh yeah, well I'm real proud of this one. And wait, that's not a fish photo.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, but this one came out really great. Seeing the parent feed the chicks like this feels really comfy.」

Natsuki
「...Are you sure that isn't because you're just hungry right now?」
％Ｂ
「No, that's not what I meant. It's more like, well... Like you took a snapshot of them being alive.」

Natsuki
「...」
％Ｂ
「'Cause these chicks look so happy, you know? Though I guess that might be just me, of course.」

％Ｂ
「But I think it's a really good photo. It really feels like you've cut out a scene from an ordinary everyday life, like you always say.」

Natsuki
「A snapshot of being alive... A scene from an ordinary everyday life... Oh...!」

Segawa suddenly stands up, her eyes wide with realization.
％Ｂ
「Wh-What's wrong? Did I say something I shouldn't have again?」
Natsuki
「No! It's the opposite!」
％Ｂ
「The opposite?」
She suddenly grabs my hand with both of hers and starts swinging it up and down vigorously.

％Ｂ
「Wha... O-Ow... Hey, that hurts...!」
Natsuki
「You're great! Or more like I'm an idiot! I forgot something important!」

％Ｂ
「S-Something important?」
Natsuki
「I knew it was a good idea to talk to you about it! That's my assistant for you! Great job!」

％Ｂ
「S-Sure... Thanks.」
Natsuki
「Aghh, I'm suddenly really hungry! Let's eat!」
％Ｂ
「Melon bread, egg sandwich, and strawberry milk. That's 350 yen.」
Natsuki
「I don't have any coins right now, so put it on my tab.」
She smiles her usual carefree smile.
I don't really get what's going on, but I guess it's good that she's figured out whatever she was worrying over...

all
Natsuki
「Hmhmmmh♪ Hmhmhmmmh♪ Hahaaah♪」
Segawa hums cheerfully as she feeds the fish in their tanks.

Marika
「Segawa-san seems happy. Did something good happen?」
％Ｂ
「No idea... I don't really get it, but she suddenly figured something out and called herself an idiot...」

Marika
「U-Umm... I guess it's a good thing that she's figured something out, at least...」

Natsuki
「Hey, Marika. Are you going to display these tanks like this?」
Marika
「Senpai and I have been talking about making a more proper display out of them, because it'd be a little too boring like this.」

all
Misa
「We would like to recreate Shionagi's sea as best as we can, so I was thinking of perhaps covering the bottoms of the tanks with sand and placing driftwood inside.」

％Ｂ
「Oh, that sounds great.」
Misa
「I have already arranged to borrow the necessary sand and driftwood from Marinpia, so Marika-san and I will be going to retrieve them tomorrow.」


％Ｂ
「I'll come with, then. I'm sure the sand will be heavy.」
Natsuki
「No, you can't. You're going to be with me tomorrow.」
all
％Ｂ
「Wha... What for? This is the first I've heard of this.」
Natsuki
「I'm going to take photos at the beach tomorrow. And you'll be coming with me, obviously.」
％Ｂ
「Photos at the beach... again?」
Misa
「I believe the photos you have taken for us already should be more than enough for the display...」

Natsuki
「I'm going to redo all of those photos.」
Marika
「What? ...But those photos were really good, though.」
Misa
「I also believed them to be quite wonderful...」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. I've already told you, but they came out really nice. They're like something you'd see in a field guide.」


Natsuki
「That's exactly why I'm redoing them.」
％Ｂ
「???」
Natsuki
「Anyway, you and I are going to the beach to take photos tomorrow. See you there!」

I have no idea what's going on anymore...
