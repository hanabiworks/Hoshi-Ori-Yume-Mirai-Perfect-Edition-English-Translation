The seasons change again. May arrives.
It's been a month since I graduated university and began working at the Azuma Architectural Firm as a full-time employee.

I've mostly been tasked with being an assistant for my senior coworkers, and grunt work.
But I still feel like I'm growing day by day.
I'm satisfied with both my work and my personal life.
It's already been four years since Rikka and I started living here together.
％Ｂ
「The orchestra concert's finally next week.」
It's the performance with the Moscow Philharmonic she's been preparing for since last year.
The concert is finally next weekend.
It's also going to be Rikka's debut performance as a professional.
Rikka
「Hehe. I feel like you're more nervous about this than I am.」
％Ｂ
「Of course I'm nervous. There's the fact that it's your professional debut, but I'm also gonna be meeting with your parents afterward...」
I'll be meeting with them... to get them to approve of me marrying Rikka.
It's an absolutely necessary path I have to take as a man.
I've decided to do this when her parents come to Japan to watch her in her proudest moment.

...And we're going to have them sign as witnesses on our marriage registration.
We're probably both going to be busy this year, so we're just going to get the registration out of the way, and hold the actual ceremony next year.
Rikka
「It's not like you'll be meeting them for the first time, right? We got them to approve of us living together, and I've already told them I'm planning on introducing you. You don't need to be so nervous, hehe.」
She's smiling in amusement.
％Ｂ
「Ghhh... You'll know how I feel once you go to meet my parents.」

Rikka's concert with the Moscow Philharmonic.
It's her first big event, with the name "Narusawa Rikka" being pushed front and center for the concert.

I'm sure this concert will be the starting point for her career as a professional musician.

It's that important of a concert.
And so, the concert began...
I, along with Meguru-chan and Rikka's parents, watched Rikka's confident performance, completely lost for words.
all
The orchestra fascinated the audience...
And Rikka's debut performance ended amidst a standing ovation.
I'm waiting with Meguru-chan and her parents outside the concert hall for Rikka to come out.
Meguru
「Oh...」
Meguru
「Onee-chaaaan!!」
Meguru-chan spots Rikka, immediately sprints over to her, and jumps onto her.
Rikka
「Kyahhh!? Wh-What, Meguru...?」
Meguru
「C-Congratulations... Fueh, ueeehhh... I-I'm so glad... This is great... Onee-chaaan...!」

She cries fat tears, completely overcome with emotion.
Rikka
「Hehe. Why are you the one who's crying, Meguru?」
Meguru
「I can't, I can't help iiiit...! Uuh, uuuh, fhhh... I really dhink ids greadh and... Hic, agh, congratulations!」

Rikka
「Hehe, I can't cry now that you're crying this much. Come on, you're going to ruin your makeup.」
She dabs at Meguru-chan's eyes with a handkerchief.
Meguru
「Uuuuh, uuh, uuuuhhh... I-I'm sorry... I'm sorryyy...! Congratulations, Onee-chaaaaan...! Fueeehhh...!」
Rikka
「...Thank you. It's all thanks to you and everyone else. I'm finally able to stand at the start line.」

％Ｂ
「Congratulations, Rikka.」
I call out at an appropriate time.
Rikka
「Hehe, thank you. Though things are still only just beginning.」
Meguru
「O-Onee-chan... Hic, I-I'm coming back... to Japan this October, so... I want to play... piano together... with you.」
Rikka
「That's your recital, isn't it? Are you sure?」
Meguru
「Eegh... If you're not opposed to it... I want you to be the guest performer...」
Rikka
「Of course I'm not opposed to it. I'd love to. We promised, after all.」
Meguru
「Mhm... I'm looking forward to it so muuuchh... Ueeh, waaaahhh!」
She starts crying again.
Rikka's tearing up watching her.
The promise they weren't able to make good on.
A faraway memory between these two sisters, a promise to both become professional pianists and play "A Fragment of Emotion" together.
Rikka tenderly strokes Meguru-chan's hair as she continues to cry... Just watching them makes me really happy.
％Ｂ
「Hgh...」
My heart's never felt so constricted before.
I'm going to be meeting with Rikka's parents in the apartment that Rikka lived in as a high schooler.
％Ｂ
「You sure a cake's fine as a gift? Maybe something else would've been better... Or no, maybe a more expensive cake...」
Rikka
「You're too worried. You didn't even need to bring a gift.」
％Ｂ
「I-I can't not bring one! What if they think I'm rude!?」

Rikka
「You don't need to worry. You've met them before. They were just normal parents, weren't they?」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, if you talk to them... Though they're still a world-renowned conductor and pianist.」
But it's not like I can just stand here in front of the door forever.

Slap, slap!
I slap myself on the cheeks twice to pump myself up.
％Ｂ
「All right! I'm ready! I'm gonna get them to let me marry you!」

Rikka
「I'll open the door, then.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, Meguru-chan.」
Rikka's parents are there, as well as Meguru-chan.
Meguru
「Wooow～ I've never seen you wear a suit before, Nii-san.」
％Ｂ
「I wear one every day for work, but I'm still not really used to it.」
I still feel it's more like the suit's wearing me than the other way around.
But I wanted to make an impression today.
I checked how I looked over and over in the mirror, and I asked Rikka to make sure nothing looked weird before coming here.
all
％Ｂ
「Uhh... A-Anyway, today...」
Rikka's Father
「...」
Rikka's dad is sitting at the table, looking at me with a really stern expression.
Uuuh... Crap.
I know I pumped myself up earlier, but I'm so ridiculously nervous that I'm feeling pins and needles on my palms and toes.
Rikka
「I'll ask them with you. Let's do our best to get them to approve.」
She speaks in a low voice and grips my hand tight.
％Ｂ
「Yeah. Okay.」
all
Meguru
「Geez, Dad. What are you looking so serious for? I get that you're nervous, but you'll make Nii-san nervous too with a face like that. Come on, smile～」
Meguru-chan suddenly pinches her father's cheeks and pulls them upward.
My nervousness fades just a tiny bit at the heartwarming sight.
Rikka's Father
「S-Stop that, Meguru.」
Meguru
「I'm not gonnaaa. Squish squish squiiish～ Come on, smile, smiiile～」
Rikka's Father
「I can't help it... I can't not be nervous, as a father...」

all
Sayaka
「Ufufu. Meguru's right, dear. Ryousuke-san, let's not just stand here. Would you like to take a seat?」

Sayaka
「Ufufu. Meguru's right, dear. Now, let's not just stand here. Would you like to take a seat?」

％Ｂ
「Y-Yes...!」
A few days later.
Rikka
「Uuuuh... I'm starting to get nervous. Maybe I should've worn something more formal...」
％Ｂ
「My mom said to wear something comfortable, so what you're wearing is probably perfect.」
Rikka
「But I'm going to be talking to your parents about us getting married. I need to make sure I don't cause any offense...」
％Ｂ
「See? Now you know how I felt.」
Rikka
「Mmhhh...」
％Ｂ
「Don't worry. I'm with you.」
Rikka
「Oh...」
I hold Rikka's hand, just like she did for me when I went to speak with Rikka's parents.
％Ｂ
「Besides, my mom loves you more than she loves me. She's probably just raring to welcome you into the family with some sushi laid out or something.」

Rikka
「I hope so... But I'll be asking to be added to your family registry. I need to make sure they approve of me as their daughter...」
Mother
「Rikka-chaaan～ It's been so long! How've you been?」
Rikka
「M-Mother!?」
Mother
「Geeeez, I could hear you two from outside, but you just weren't coming in. So I decided to come out and greet you.」
Mother
「We ordered first-class sushi. His father's eagerly waiting with beer, so come on in already.」
％Ｂ
「See? Nothing to worry about, right?」
Rikka
「Hehe, mhm. Thank you very much for inviting me over today, Mother. I hope we can continue to get along in the future as well.」
Rikka
「...」
Rikka and I are sitting close on the living room couch, staring at a single sheet of paper.
Our marriage registration form.
The names and seals of my dad and Rikka's dad―my father-in-law―have been placed in the witness fields.
％Ｂ
「I'm glad my parents were able to meet yours while they were in Japan.」
Rikka
「Hehe, we've been really busy these past two weeks, haven't we? I'm a little tired.」

She leans against me and nuzzles her head against my shoulder.
％Ｂ
「Now that I think about it, it might've been better if we had just done this at around the same time as the ceremony, without rushing.」
Rikka
「We did this late, if you ask me. I would've wanted to do this right after you proposed to me.」
％Ｂ
「That's really jumping the gun, don't you think?」
Rikka
「I know it is. But... I wanted to be Hino Rikka as soon as possible.」
Rikka
「I know it is. But... I wanted to be ％Ａ Rikka as soon as possible.」
％Ｂ
「...Hngh.」
Rikka
「You'll... make me Hino Rikka, won't you?」
Rikka
「You'll... make me ％Ａ Rikka, won't you?」
％Ｂ
「O-Of course I will...!」
％Ｂ
「Or more like... You'll let me make you... right?」
Rikka
「Hehe, why even bother asking? I want you to.」
％Ｂ
「Well, I dunno, it just doesn't really feel real. I wonder what's gonna change once we're married.」

Rikka
「Hmm～ ...I wonder...」
We think it over.
％Ｂ
「Maybe things won't change much from now.」
Rikka
「Hehehe, you're right. I want to continue this happy life forever. Oh, but there is one thing...」
％Ｂ
「Hm?」
Rikka
「I want a baby. Your baby...」
％Ｂ
「Hgh...」
％Ｂ
「Me too.」
％Ｂ
「I wonder what our kid would be like...」
Rikka
「I don't mind if it's a boy or a girl, I just want one like you. With your eyes, your nose, your mouth, hehehe.」
She lovingly touches each part of my face as she lists them off.
％Ｂ
「Hahaha, that tickles... I'd feel bad if we had a girl that looked like me.」
Rikka
「Oh, I think she'd be cuter than you think. You have kind of a young-looking face, so I think makeup would go well on her.」
％Ｂ
「I'd want a kid that looks like you. They'd be good-looking regardless of whether they're a boy or girl. They'd never be wanting in terms of relationships in the future.」
Rikka
「There's no point in them being popular. They'd have to find the one person they could see loving for the rest of their life, just like I did.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, of course. But you wouldn't want our kid to have trouble with that kinda stuff, right?」
％Ｂ
「'Cause you've got your nice, graceful eyes and nose, and I love the shape of your ears and lips too.」
I stroke her features with my fingertips.
Rikka
「Hehe, hehehe... You're right, that does tickle... Ahaha... Geez, you'll make me want to kiss you if you touch me that much... Mmh, chu.」
Rikka
「And besides, your face is plenty attractive too. I don't know any man more good-looking than you.」

％Ｂ
「You're way too biased.」
Rikka
「Not at all. Just look at how wonderful you are! Chu, chuuuh!」
％Ｂ
「Haha, we're gonna dote on them so much no matter who they end up looking like...」
It's our kid, after all.
I can't imagine us becoming anything less than full-on doting parents.
％Ｂ
「What are we gonna do if they get interested in playing piano like you?」
Rikka
「I'll let them. No matter what lies in store for them, they won't regret anything if it's a path they chose for themselves. I'd want to support them as much as I can, as their mother.」
Rikka
「And if they end up face to face with hardship... Hehe, I don't think I need to be too worried. Because they'll have the best papa possible with them.」
％Ｂ
「Papa...」
The word's always seemed so far away, but now it seems so near...
I wonder if something inside me's changed now that the turning point known as marriage is right before me.
Rikka
「They might become interested in architecture and want to build houses like you, or they might have completely different interests. No matter what happens, I want them to be able to do whatever they want.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. I think so too.」
It's a little further in the future.
But if we wish for it, it's not too far away.
We had lots of fun talking about our future until late at night, watching the marriage registration form before us.
