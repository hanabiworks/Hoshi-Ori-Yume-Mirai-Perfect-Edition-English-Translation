Today's the day of Touko's second exam.
I'm sure she'll pass as long as she makes good use of all the effort she's put in until now.

Touko
「...Mhm, I don't think I forgot anything. I need to get going.」
％Ｂ
「You're not nervous, right? Three hours is less than you think, so be careful about your time, all right?」


Touko
「Ahaha, thanks. I'm going, then. Mmh.」

I pack a good luck charm into our usual send-off greeting.
I know she'll be able to take her exam without getting nervous when I see her smile her usual relaxed smile.

She puts on her coat and walks out the door.
I pray for her success as I see her off.
％Ｂ
「...Good luck, Touko.」
Touko
「I'm hooome. Ahh, I'm tired...!」
％Ｂ
「Welcome home. How'd you do?」
Touko
「Mmm... I don't know? I think I did everything I could.」
I remember she said something similar last year after coming back from her exam.
But... unlike that time, Touko's expression tells me she thinks she did pretty well.

Touko
「Mm... chu. All that's left is to wait for the result. Ahh, I wanna relax for a whiiile.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, you've been doing so much work for a whole year. You really must be tired. Great work.」

Touko
「I really aaam... I want a massaaage.」

％Ｂ
「Yes, yes. I'll give you a special massage as a reward for all your hard work today.」
Touko
「Yaaay! Then let's take a bath together after the massage! And then let's make dinner together, and relax watching TV... and let's sleep really well together tonight.」


Doing normal, casual everyday things "together."
Getting to do those everyday things "together" is a luxury we haven't been able to do because we've been so busy.

Touko
「You're going to spoil me lots to make up for all the effort I put in. I need to make sure I don't fall asleep in the middle of your massage, 
Ryousuke, 

because you're so good at them.」

％Ｂ
「Am I? I've never given anyone else one, so I think it's just that I'm used to touching you.」

Touko
「...I kinda don't like the way you said that.」
I feel like we've finally returned to the way we used to be.
It wasn't really on purpose, but we've been somewhat on edge this entire time because of the anxiety from our exams.

...I hope she passes with a smile on her face.
I earnestly wish for Touko's efforts to bear fruit.
