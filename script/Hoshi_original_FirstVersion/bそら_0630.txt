「There's something I want to tell all of you.」
It's Monday after school.
I've brought Sora to the committee office to make a certain announcement to everyone who's agreed to help the astronomy club.


Shuuichi
「That face tells me you've finally done it.」
％Ｂ
「That's right. Sora and I are dating now.」

Sora
「...*nod*」
all
Marika
「...」
Natsuki
「...」
Misa
「...」
all
Rikka
「...」
Touko
「...」
Shuuichi
「...」
all
―Everyone's speechless.
Yeah, I can imagine why...
％Ｂ
「...I know you're all a little surprised about the sudden announcement, but we didn't really wanna hide it, so we decided to just say it.」


％Ｂ
「Nothing's really going to change, but thank you very much anyway.」

Sora
「...Thank you... very much.」
Marika
「O-Okay... Of course... but that really was sudden...」
all
Natsuki
「I more or less figured it out already. Good for you. You didn't get rejected.」

all
Rikka
「It's fine to date... but did you really have to go through the trouble of telling us here?」


Touko
「I guess it's fine? If they tried to be secretive about it, it'd make things awkward when we eventually found out.」

all
Misa
「I think beginning a relationship is a very wonderful thing. Congratulations to the both of you!」

％Ｂ
「Thank you very much, Senpai.」
all
Natsuki
「Wait, though. So what happened with her first love, then?」
％Ｂ
「Th-That ended up just being―」
all
Sora
「...
Ryou 
He 
was my first love.」
％Ｂ
「Huh?」
Sora
「...My first love was the person who pulled me by the hand and saved me. And that was 

Ryou
him
.」
Sora
「But that's not relevant anymore. Because I like the present 

Ryou
him
.」
Marika
「Umm... What does that mean?」
％Ｂ
「Uhh... Here, I'll explain.」
all
I tell everyone about how I had met Sora before in the past.
％Ｂ
「So I actually met her a long time ago, when we were both kids.」
Natsuki
「Whaaat the heck is that? Were your fates written into the stars or something? No wonder she's in the astronomy club.」

Touko
「Oh, that was a good one, Camera-chan!」
all
Everyone laughs when Yukimura points out Segawa's word choice.

I laugh, and so does Sora.
We smile at each other.
all
Everyone's celebrating us being together.
I'm glad we decided to tell them.
Shuuichi
「More importantly, what's the astronomy club doing for the festival? I thought you were going to talk about that.」

Shuuichi wrenches the celebratory atmosphere right back into reality.
Everyone falls silent and glares at him.
Natsuki
「Come on, Nirasawa. Learn to read the mood a little.」
Shuuichi
「Uh...」
Natsuki
「Ugh. Workaholics are always so bad at things like this.」
Misa
「I feel... there may be something that is to be said about that...」
Marika
「I think... there might've been a better way of saying that～」
Touko
「"More importantly" was a bad thing to say.」
Rikka
「How tactless.」
Shuuichi
「No, but... Wait, what? Was what I said that bad...?」

Shuuichi looks like he's about to cry.

％Ｂ
「Uhh... It's not your fault, man. Though I dunno how much that means, coming from me.」
I pat him on the shoulder.
all
％Ｂ
「We all had lots of ideas for what the astronomy club could do, but we thought of a pretty good one recently. I wanted to know what you guys thought of it.」


％Ｂ
「Ahem... How about a planetarium?」
Marika
「A planetarium? ...By planetarium, you mean a planetarium?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. A planetarium. It's actually kind of like we're combining all of our ideas from last time.」


I start writing out everyone's suggestions on the whiteboard.
％Ｂ
「Shinozaki said a stargazing tour, and Segawa said a star photo gallery. Okihara-senpai said a simulated starflight using jellyfish, Narusawa said a space-and-star-themed concert, and Yukimura said a resting area.」


％Ｂ
「You could do all of these with a planetarium.」

％Ｂ
「It's pretty obvious how with Shinozaki and Segawa's ideas, for instance, and it'd be like Senpai's idea in that we'd be creating a place that's kinda removed from reality.」

％Ｂ
「We can play themed music when we're running the planetarium show like Narusawa's suggestion, and it'd be a pretty restful place when you're sitting inside.」


Marika
「Yeah, you're right.」
Natsuki
「I think that sounds pretty good.」
Misa
「A planetarium sounds wonderful to me.」
all
Rikka
「I feel like it might be a little forced, but...」

Touko
「I'm fine as long as I get to relax.」
Everyone seems relatively okay with it.
A planetarium would be pretty much impossible without all their help.
all
It's important that everyone involved really believes that it's possible to pull off too.

％Ｂ
「If everyone's in agreement, then we wanna go with this idea. The astronomy club can make a planetarium for the festival. What do you think?」

Marika
「I'm for it～!」

Natsuki
「Yeah, why not?」
all
Misa
「It's very wonderful!」
Rikka
「Sounds like something worth doing.」
all
Touko
「I'm looking forward to seeing it completed.」
Shuuichi
「If it's completed, that is.」
all
The girls all look at Shuuichi again.

Shuuichi
「I'm not saying it to be mean or anything. We need to take a step back and look at everything calmly right now.」


Shuuichi continues talking, looking serious.
Shuuichi
「A planetarium's a good idea. But the problem's the budget for the materials you'll be using. I don't know any specifics, but I bet those are going to cost a decent amount.」


all
％Ｂ
「It'd be... What would the cost be, Sora?」
Sora
「...We need a projector and a dome for the stars at the very least for sure. These would be rented.」

％Ｂ
「About how much does it cost to rent those?」
Sora
「...About 70,000 yen for the projector. About 30,000 for the dome.」
％Ｂ
「Th-That's pretty pricey...」
Sora
「...There are cheaper ones. But you get what you pay for.」

Shuuichi
「You'll probably have other things you'll need too, which easily puts the budget over 100,000 yen. Where are you gonna get those funds from?」

％Ｂ
「What do you mean? ...That's what club funds are for, right? Right, Sora?」

all
Sora
「...」
Sora looks away.
％Ｂ
「Sora?」
Sora
「...A club with only one member doesn't have much money.」
％Ｂ
「B-But that means you've still got some money, right?」
Sora
「...I bought an erect-image diagonal for the telescope last month. Leaving... about 5,000 yen.」

％Ｂ
「...5,000?」
Marika
「So you've already used most of the year's budget up...」
％Ｂ
「We can't rent the stuff we need with that...」
Sora
「...I'm sorry. I didn't think I'd want to participate in the Tanabata Festival.」

Shuuichi
「It's a shame, but we'll have to reject the planetarium idea. Maybe you should start thinking of different ideas?」

Sora
「...」
Sora's expression doesn't change, but I can tell that her shoulders slumped a little.

all
％Ｂ
「W-Wait a second. Could you let us think of some ideas that'd let us do the planetarium?」

Shuuichi
「Like what?」
％Ｂ
「Uh... L-Like...」
Marika
「Is there any way they could get some extra funding from the school, since it's for an event?」

Shuuichi
「No. That's already included in the club funding.」
Natsuki
「Then... what about getting an advance on club funding?」
Shuuichi
「I've never heard of anyone doing that before. And there's no way it'd be possible anyway.」
all
Misa
「And it would be difficult for the event committee to assist in that way...」
Shuuichi
「Indeed. We can't support just one club to that extent above all others.」

all
Touko
「Mmm... Maybe we could set up a fundraiser?」
Shuuichi
「You're free to do so... but is anyone gonna try funding a club that hasn't actually done anything before?」
Rikka
「...You're so petty.」
Shuuichi
「Wha? Why am I suddenly the bad guy!?」
all
％Ｂ
「A-Anyway, could you let us think a little more about the budget stuff?」
％Ｂ
「Having to compromise on the astronomy club's display would be spitting in the face of its finally deciding to participate. I wanna do as much as I can for what the astronomy club wants to do.」

Shuuichi
「Hmm... I guess you're right. And Ousaka's a first year, too. We wouldn't want her to not want to participate in the future either.」


Shuuichi
「I understand. But exams start next week, so there's no more committee activities this week. Let's discuss this again after exams. That good?」


％Ｂ
「Yeah. That's fine.」
Shuuichi
「Think of a plan B too, just in case. We really won't have much time to prepare if we start after exams. Definitely not enough to take the time to think of a second idea at that point, all right?」


％Ｂ
「Got it.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
all
％Ｂ
「The budget... I guess it's an unavoidable obstacle.」
Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「I probably should've looked into how much it'd cost beforehand. I got a little carried away with our idea.」

Sora
「...I should've explained it to you properly.」
％Ｂ
「No, I'm the one who came up with the idea, so...」
Regardless, we have to solve the issue of funding in order to make the planetarium a reality.

％Ｂ
「I wonder if we'd at least be able to get a cheap projector with 5,000 yen.」
Sora
「...We could get one for home use.」
％Ｂ
「Home use...」
Sora
「...I have one of those already. It's a simple design that's made for just projecting constellations onto the ceiling.」

％Ｂ
「Could we use that in the worst-case scenario?」
Sora
「...It isn't something worth showing and explaining to others. It's like a toy for relaxation.」

Sora
「...If we're doing this, then I want to be able to show the stars moving. Photos would be enough if we just wanted to show constellations.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah...」
What Sora really wants to do is communicate the wonders of the stars.\n \n\r
If we just wanted to show people constellations, then we could use photos. But that wouldn't be an actual planetarium.

％Ｂ
「Shuuichi's gonna hate it, but I'm gonna put off thinking of a plan B until the last possible moment. Let's focus on thinking about how to make the planetarium possible instead. I'm sure we'll come up with a good idea.」


Sora
「...*nod*」
Sora
「...But before that, exams.」
％Ｂ
「Y-Yeah, you're right. I'm not feeling too confident on the stuff that's going to be on the exams that's from back before I transferred in...」


all
Especially since I don't know the strategies for the exams at this school.
Like whether I should be memorizing the textbook, or if I should be focusing on what I took notes on...
Sora
「...Be careful of failing.」
％Ｂ
「Something bad happen if I fail?」
Sora
「...You'll have to take supplemental lessons over summer break.」
％Ｂ
「No way... I won't be able to help with Tanabata Festival preparations then.」

Sora
「...*nod*」
Sora
「...That's why club and committee activities aren't allowed the week before exams. We have to study.」

％Ｂ
「I get it... I gotta be on top of this, then.」
Even if we do end up finding a good way to make the planetarium happen, it'd be the worst thing ever if I couldn't help with that.

And that's the case not just for me, but for Sora too...
％Ｂ
「...By the way, what are your grades like?」
Sora
「...Pretty good.」
She snaps her thumb up at me.
