「A lot of women won't be convinced until they see it for themselves... They won't understand unless they get to actually compare them.」

There's just something about what Marika said yesterday.
If "she won't understand unless she compares them"... Then that means she'll understand if she does get to compare them.

％Ｂ
「But it's impossible to compare the actual houses, so...」
I've created diagrams and models of the blueprints that Azuma-san made.
But were these not enough?
Then...
％Ｂ
「...Okay.」
I steel myself and head toward Azuma-san's desk.
％Ｂ
「Chief. I'd like to discuss something with you about the Oono residence.」
Azuma
「Hm? What is it?」
％Ｂ
「Could we... draft out a blueprint for the plans according to Oono-san's wife's wishes?」

Azuma
「Hoooh... What do you mean?」
％Ｂ
「She doesn't have any way to compare the two. I'd like to make a model of the alternative plan as a way to get her to understand our plan.」


％Ｂ
「I'd like to try to convince her by having her compare between the two plans.」

Azuma
「And so you want us to go out of our way to bring this other plan to life just for that?」

％Ｂ
「...Is that not possible?」
Azuma
「That's not going to be the only thing you'll have to do, you know. This might end up taking away from your other duties. And you've got your exam prep too.」


％Ｂ
「That's...」
Azuma
「But... if you'll say you'll do all of it, then feel free.」
％Ｂ
「Oh... Yes! Of course!」
all
I've been okayed by Azuma-san.
Now I need to get the details from the other party, draft the blueprints...
There's tons for me to do.
I just need to get started right away!
Oono
「I apologize for being late again...」
Oono's Wife
「We are so very sorry. This is why I said we shouldn't take the new highway.」


Oono
「It isn't usually that packed. When I usually take it for work...」

％Ｂ
「N-Now, now, you two.」
Things seem kinda tense. Maybe it's 'cause they're arguing about the house plans too.
％Ｂ
「I apologize for asking you to come so suddenly. The reason I had you come out here is, of course...」

％Ｂ
「Because I wished to try drafting out a blueprint for the plan that your wife would like.」

Oono's Wife
「Oh my... So then we'll forget the old suggestion?」
％Ｂ
「No, I'd like to have you actually compare the two plans and come to a conclusion that way.」

Oono
「I see. You're right, that would make it easy to understand... but are you sure that wouldn't be quite a lot of extra work?」

％Ｂ
「Oh no, this is just another part of my job.」
％Ｂ
「And so I wished to hear from you what aspects of the current plan you wished to improve and how. This is your initial list of requests...」

％Ｂ
「Let's see, so this is today's... and this is the one from before...」
I compare the list of requests that I got from Oono-san's wife today to the one we wrote out initially.

％Ｂ
「...This part's a bit different from what they originally requested too...」
There's a lot of parts that are different from today and when we originally asked them.\n\r

People sure change their opinions a lot over time.
There were probably some things they thought of once they saw our actual plans, too.

Anyway, let's try drafting together a blueprint that'll fulfill all of their wishes from today.

％Ｂ
「Okay! I'll work on this until 1, and then study after that!」
