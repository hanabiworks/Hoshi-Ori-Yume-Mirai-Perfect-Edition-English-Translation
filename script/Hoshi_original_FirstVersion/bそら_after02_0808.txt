I've come to the Azuma Architectural Firm for a meeting about the cultural hall.

Azuma
「Hm... Well, I think we can wrap things up here for today.」
％Ｂ
「Great work today, Teacher.」
Azuma
「Yeah, likewise. Come again in a week.」
％Ｂ
「I understand. Um... Also, I'd like to talk about a separate matter.」
Azuma
「Hm? What is it?」
％Ｂ
「I heard that the science museum's going to be torn down next summer. It's apparently going to be reopened afterward. And... I heard that there's going to be a design competition for it.」


Azuma
「...News spread pretty fast... I assume you heard that from Sora-chan? I guess it makes sense that you already know, since she works there.」

Azuma
「That building's pretty old, after all. Parts of it don't follow current fire safety laws, and there's a concern about its earthquake resilience. They're planning on taking it all down and replacing it completely.」


Azuma
「I was thinking of letting you know about it once it started coming up. Since they're apparently planning on going for a young architect this competition.」


％Ｂ
「Wha... So then you won't be participating?」
Azuma
「I've gotten an offer to participate as one of the panel judges.」

％Ｂ
「You're going to be on the panel!?」
Azuma
「Just so you know, that doesn't mean you've got a leg up over the competition now. The fact that I know you won't mean anything at all to me for this.」


％Ｂ
「If anything, I feel like I'm at a disadvantage now. You're especially harsh on people you personally know.」

Azuma
「Another thing. If there aren't any good designs in that competition, then the design rights are going to go directly to me instead.」

％Ｂ
「What!? Then that means you could just fail all of the submissions and get the job for yourself if you wanted to!」

Azuma
「Why would I waste my time like that? If I wanted to do that, I'd have just told them to let me do it from the start.」


％Ｂ
「I was kidding. But I understand what you're getting at. You want me to submit a design that surpasses Azuma Morio.」

Azuma
「That's right. So, gonna do it?」

％Ｂ
「I have no reason not to.」
This competition isn't just any competition for me.
It's to take the places I associate with my memories and connect them to the future by my own hand.
It's to grant my girlfriend's "selfish" request.
And now, it's also to surpass my mentor.
％Ｂ
「I'm starting to feel really motivated. I'll win that competition, I swear!」

Azuma
「Yeah. I'm expecting good things.」

I meet up with Sora at night and we go out to town together.
Tonight's the city's Tanabata Festival.
％Ｂ
「Speaking of, what'd we do last year for Tanabata again?」
Sora
「...It rained.」
％Ｂ
「Ohhh, right. I remember we were disappointed that we didn't get to see the stars.」

The city's dressed up with vivid and colorful Tanabata decorations.
There are lots of people too.
I casually grasp Sora's hand.
Sora
「...Hehe...」
She happily squeezes back.
％Ｂ
「Don't let go now, all right? I don't want you getting lost.」
Sora
「...Mmhhh...」
I was trying to be nice, but it looks like I made her a bit angry...
％Ｂ
「The Tanabata Festival always reminds me of when we were in high school.」
I hastily change the subject.
％Ｂ
「Sure takes me back... That homemade planetarium. We sure went through a lot to make that thing.」

Sora
「...Ritsu was a harsh teacher.」
％Ｂ
「Ahaha, she sure was. But you improved a lot thanks to her.」

Sora
「...*nod*」
Sora
「...I thought I did well at the time, but thinking about it now, I feel like my face might emit a solar flare.」

％Ｂ
「Ohh... Now that's a new level of embarrassment...」
We're not talking fire, we're talking sun-level heat...
Sora
「...I still don't think I'm good at it. I need to study the stars more and do my best.」

I think she's already impressive enough. I wonder what she's going to end up like if she studies even more...

Imagine if she learns space language or something and becomes able to talk to aliens.

％Ｂ
「...Haha. I could see it.」
Sora
「...What's so funny?」
％Ｂ
「No, nothing.」
We head to the park to take a breather in the cool of the evening after getting tired of the crowds.

We're looking up at the night sky, licking the candied strawberries we bought on the way, when Sora starts a constellation quiz.

Sora
「...What constellation do you get when you connect that star, that star... and that star?」
％Ｂ
「...The airplane constellation.」
Sora
「...And if you make a rectangle, with that first-magnitude star at the center?」
％Ｂ
「The missile constellation.」
Sora
「...Then that one, that one, and that one.」
％Ｂ
「It's the monster constellation.」
Sora
「...All correct.」
％Ｂ
「Ahaha, that takes me back. I know, you should put that into the next show you're coming up with.」

Sora
「...I think the kids would like it.」
％Ｂ
「Right? You can add in a superhero constellation and a superheroine constellation. I bet they'd love it!」

Sora
「...I feel like we could sell merchandise.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, I like that idea! How about we make some money!」
Sora
「...Hehe...」

Two shooting stars cut through our field of view as we're joking around.

％Ｂ
「Oh, shooting stars. There are two of them, so I guess that's two people's worth of wishes.」
Sora
「...Stragglers from the Perseid meteor shower.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah... You said that's mostly what they are around this time of year, right? Doesn't seeing shooting stars get your heart going a bit?」

Sora
「...Do they?」
％Ｂ
「They might be ordinary for you, but they're pretty exciting for someone who doesn't get to see them that often at all.」

％Ｂ
「Remember how everyone loved the final shooting stars segment for the planetarium back in high school?」

Sora
「...Now that you mention it, the visitors always cry out when the shooting stars come on at the planetarium too.」

％Ｂ
「Right? They're just that exciting to see. I bet I'd keel over from amazement if I saw a full meteor shower.」


Sora
「...If a meteor shower makes you faint, then what would happen for a meteor swarm or storm...?」
％Ｂ
「I've heard of meteor swarms, but there are meteor storms too? How are they different?」

Sora
「...There's no precise definition. A meteor swarm is one hundred shooting stars in an hour. A meteor storm is one thousand in an hour. That's a common naming rule.」


％Ｂ
「Do those seriously exist!?」
Sora
「...The thirteen-year cycle of the Draconids and the thirty-three-year cycle of the Leonids are famous. There are historical accounts of five thousand shooting stars in a single hour.」


％Ｂ
「I can definitely see why you'd call it a storm of shooting stars. Can you see that at a planetarium?」

Sora
「...You can see meteor showers. But I don't know about meteor swarms or storms.」

％Ｂ
「Really... I'd wanna see it someday.」
Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「...Countless shooting stars, falling like rain in a storm.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
Sora
「...I'll go with that.」
％Ｂ
「Wha... Go with...? Go with what?」
Sora
「...It's the theme for the new show. "Shooting Stars."」
％Ｂ
「Ohh! That's a great idea! First the moon, then shooting stars! The visitors are gonna love it!」

Sora
「...You helped me again, Ryou. Thank you.」
Sora
「...You helped me again. Thank you.」
She bows her head in gratitude.
