「...」
The clock ticks.
I open up my well-worn, familiar textbooks and workbooks and continue studying for my subject exam.

There's a month until the exam.
I've been studying this whole time already, but you can never be too prepared.

This is my long-awaited first step toward my dream.
I won't stumble here. I'll pass no matter what.
―For both my sake and Touko's.
Touko and I attended the same university after graduating high school.
Though we may be going to the same school, our majors are different.
I'm studying architecture, like I had planned.
I'm currently studying to receive second-class architect qualifications while I'm still in university.
As for Touko... Unexpectedly enough, she applied to the English literature department.
We took university as the opportunity to start living together.
Touko got permission from my parents, and I got permission from hers.
We were allowed to live together because both of our parents trust in our relationship.

I remember how shocked we were when we moved in. "Is it really okay for us to be living in such a nice room?"

Both of our families were fine with it though, saying, "Renting out two rooms would just be a waste of a room anyway."

We started our new life together with excitement in our hearts.
We had both thought that living together would let us be together more.

But... living together presented more difficulties than we had imagined.

The first was the difference in our schedules.
We may have been taking classes on the same campus, but they were in completely different locations.
The content and schedules of our lectures weren't the same either.
We'd be able to leave for class or go home together maybe once a week if we were lucky.\n \n\r
My schedule was always packed with classes from morning until night, so Touko usually adjusted her schedule to work with mine.

We only got to spend time together at home and on days when we didn't have class.\n \n\r
And even then, I had my internship, and Touko sometimes had to work shifts for her job too... Our schedules really didn't line up.

We felt a gulf between us despite living together, which gave birth to loneliness in our hearts.
But we made sure to talk it out with one another each time, and overcame it together.
There was also housework, like cleaning and laundry. Our preferences for food. Things like whether we liked the room hot or cold, and when we got out of bed and when we went to sleep.

An endless number of tiny little habits and tendencies that we discovered.
Touko was always honest about her feedback, and she was quick to accept new things that were to her liking.

We each made compromises and new rules.
At some point it became fun for us to find those kinds of differences between us.

There were things that were fun, and there were things that were a bit difficult for us... I think getting to experience lots of things together has made us even closer.

Time passed quickly once we got used to living together...
And now it's been four years since we graduated from Shionagi First Academy.
％Ｂ
「She'll probably be home soon...」
I pause my studying to look at the clock. It's past 10 p.m.
Touko's working her part-time job again today.
She's been working at the same café since high school.

I never would've expected the carefree and easily bored Touko to be able to keep working the same job for so long.

She apparently likes the job because the uniform's cute.
And, well... I'm inclined to agree that she looks cute in that maid-ish uniform.\n \n\r
The people there know me pretty well now, after all the times I dropped by without telling her to check up on how she was doing at work or to pick her up after she was done.

％Ｂ
「Maybe I'll go take a walk and pick her up... I'd be worried if she's out too long...」

Touko
「I'm hooome. Sorry I'm late. I had to help out a bit longer because someone apparently canceled their night shift at the last moment.」


Touko comes home with perfect timing, just as I'm considering leaving.
I'm just glad we didn't end up missing each other.
％Ｂ
「I was actually just thinking of going to pick you up... Wait a second, did you go wearing my clothes again?」

Touko
「It's fiiine, isn't it? I like them because they're comfortable and relaxing. Hey, can I have this?」


％Ｂ
「...Sure, if you want.」
Touko
「Yay, thanks♪ Want me to give you some of my clothes in exchange? I recommend the tight miniskirt.」

％Ｂ
「I don't need it! Why the heck are you always trying to get me to wear skirts!?」

Touko
「Because it seems like it'd be fun. I think you'd look nice and cute in one, you know.」
Yeah, as if...
We've known each other for a while now, but if there's one thing I still don't understand about Touko, it's what she finds cute.

Touko
「Ahhh... That was heavy. I bought sugar and mirin without really thinking because they were cheap, but I should've thought about it a little more.」


％Ｂ
「I bet you're tired from working late. Want me to make something quick for dinner tonight?」

Touko
「No, it's okay. I bought ingredients with something in mind, so I'll handle it, okay?」

％Ｂ
「All right. I'll leave it to you, then.」
Touko
「Hey, I haven't gotten my welcome-home greeting yet... You didn't forget, did you?」

％Ｂ
「As if. Come here.」
Touko
「Okaaay. Mm... chu.」
We give each other little kisses for when we leave the house and come back.
It's our everyday ritual that we've repeated so many times it'd be ridiculous to attempt counting.
％Ｂ
「Welcome home. You've had a long day.」
Touko
「Today wasn't really that busy. Remember how I told you we got a new employee before?」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, I remember. Are you in charge of training them?」
Touko
「Yep. Training new people tires me ooout... I always tell them I'm not good at that kinda stuff too.」

％Ｂ
「It just means they think you're dependable. You've been working there for a long time.」
Touko
「Mmm... I know, but it makes my shoulders all stiff. I still have a little more to do tonight, so I need my reward for that! Chu.」

She smiles happily after we kiss once more.
She's just as spoiled as ever.
Touko
「You're hungry after all that studying, right? I'll whip up some dinner.」

all
She goes to the kitchen and starts preparing.
She's clearly used to cooking now. I can't see any sign of the way she used to hesitate and stumble while she was still learning.

Touko's really stepped up her cooking skills as we've lived together.
She's claimed the kitchen as her own, and so I've agreed to let her prepare all of our meals.

There were a lot of failed attempts at first, and she used to take a lot of time to cook too.
But she always learned from her mistakes and steadily developed her skills.

At this point, I can't cook even half as well as she can.
She must really enjoy cooking, judging by how she's started to get fussy about the cooking utensils.

The nikujaga I taught her how to make way back then is an absolute masterpiece now.
I remember there was a period when I requested it so often that she got annoyed with me. "Nikujaga again?"

Touko
「Thanks for waitiiing. It took a little more time than I thought. Today's celebratory dinner is chicken fricassée!」

The smell of garlic wafting from the food stimulates my appetite.
The chicken and mushrooms with white sauce on top looks delicious.
％Ｂ
「Oh, this looks great! Hm? ...Celebratory?」
Touko
「...」
Ack! She's in a bad mood...!
I gotta remember! There has to be something about today...!
％Ｂ
「Uhh... It's... not the date of our first date, so, uh... I know! It's the day we first went on vacation after we started living together, right!?」

Touko
「...Minus a point. You're one away from losing now.」
Crap. I wasn't expecting this today...
This point system's something that Touko started doing so she could have even more fun living with me.

And once someone hits minus five points... the penalty of "You have to do anything the other person says" awaits.

It's cute enough when it's just something like "has to do the cleaning for a week" or "massages for a week."

But the "have to wear Touko's work uniform" I got before was actual hell...
Touko
「Come on... It's the day we first met, isn't it!? The day you just wandered into the old school building
, Ryousuke

!」
％Ｂ
「...Didn't I forget this last year too...?」
Touko
「You did. You're so cold! I can't believe you'd forget the day we first met.」

Touko's unexpectedly fond of anniversaries.
The two of us celebrate little things all the time because she says she wants to treasure her memories.

％Ｂ
「No, it's 'cause I was so busy studying...! I just wasn't thinking about it with my exam coming up!」

Touko
「...You said the same thing last year. Aw, after I tried so hard with dinner too.」

％Ｂ
「...I'm sorry.」
Touko
「I'll forgive you if you pass your exam. It's minus like ten points if you fail, okay?」

She's supporting me so I can focus on my studying.
I've been depending on her kindness a lot lately.
％Ｂ
「Yeah, okay. I swear I'll pass.」
Touko
「Mm, very good. Now let's eat while the food's still hot.」
all
％Ｂ
「I'm done with the disheees. I made coffee. You'll have some, right?」
Touko
「Mhm, thanks. Hey, look at this. They're doing a segment on the Tanabata Festival.」

I come back to the living room after washing the dishes.
Touko's watching a news program that's running a segment on Shionagi's Tanabata Festival.

％Ｂ
「Oh, you're right. That's the main street.」
Touko
「I wonder if they're starting to get ready for the Tanabata Festival about now. I bet it'll be really big again this year.」

％Ｂ
「It's already been five years since we were in the event committee... Time sure flies.」

Touko
「Ahaha, you sound like an old man. But it really is nostalgic. So much has happened since then.」

We reminisce over our memories of the event committee while drinking coffee.
The time we spent back then is directly responsible for the two of us being together now.

Touko
「It's been a while, so do you wanna go to the festival this year? Oh, but you have your exam, so maybe not?」

％Ｂ
「There's a decent amount of time between when I take the subject exam and when I know the results, so I think I should be fine. Let's see... Yeah, I think I wanna go.」


Touko
「I might let my work know soon, then. We haven't been on any dates lately, so I'm excited.」

％Ｂ
「Sorry I haven't had time for a lot of stuff. You've been doing all the housework too...」

Touko
「Don't worry. I'm doing all this because I want to.」
Our relationship's changed since we graduated high school.
I think we've learned more and more about each other through the casual way we do things for each other out of kindness and consideration.

There are habits and tendencies that even we didn't know we had.
We've naturally become able to keep those kinds of rhythms in mind as we think about each other.

Touko
「Mmm... Then, you know. We're off tomorrow, so let's just relax today. I personally think we haven't gotten to cuddle enough lately!」


％Ｂ
「Yeah... I've been busy with studying and my internship recently. It's important to take breaks every now and then.」


Touko
「That's right, don't try too hard! Then I'll go right ahead and... Hup.」

She leans against me.
I feel like I haven't gotten to experience her warmth, smell, and softness in a while.
Touko
「Ahh... It's so calming. This is my favorite thing to do.」

％Ｂ
「You've always loved doing stuff like this. Though you've finally stopped trying to get us to feed each other in front of other people.」

It really does feel like it's been a long time since I've felt this comfortable atmosphere.
It soothes my weary mind and body, and fills me up inside.

Touko
「Ahaha, that was a bit too much, yeah. Thinking back on it now... We were being pretty embarrassing, weren't we?」

％Ｂ
「...I was embarrassed back then too.」
Touko
「Oh, you're saying that now? I'm totally fine with being super lovey-dovey in public, you know.」

％Ｂ
「Come on, give me a break... I will make it up to you with interest at home, my lady.」

Touko
「Mmhehe, I like the sound of that. Being attended to like that wouldn't be bad.」
Touko's in a good mood.
I regret the fact that I haven't had much time for my girlfriend when I see that happy smile of hers.

Touko
「I think I'll have you start right away, then. Could you rub my shoulders?」

％Ｂ
「Yes, yes. The usual, right?」
Touko
「I love your massages. I think I'll have you massage lots of other spots too today.


」

％Ｂ
「Sure thing. You wanna take a bath first?」

Touko
「Yeah, I think so. But could you do just my shoulders first? Taking a bath after a shoulder rub feels so nice.」

％Ｂ
「As you command!」
Touko
「Hmh, carry on, carry on～ Let's take a bath together too, okay? I want you to wash my hair and body.」


％Ｂ
「All right, sure. We haven't done that in a while either.」
Touko
「After our bath, I'm going to have you brush and dry my hair, and then I'm going to fall asleep while you're petting my head.」

％Ｂ
「Wow, you really wanna be pampered today, huh? I hope you're at least gonna put your clothes back on yourself.」

Touko
「Nooope. You're going to do eeeverything for me
, Ryousuke

!」
She cuddles with me playfully.
I think she's gotten even more like this than she was in the past.

It probably means our hearts have moved even closer since then.
I feel blessed to live out a life that's so warm and comfortable.
