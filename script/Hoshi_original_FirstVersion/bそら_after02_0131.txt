It's the end of January.
Fukuzawa-san's home remodeling is finally complete as of today.
％Ｂ
「Congratulations on your remodeling, Fukuzawa-san.」
Fukuzawa
「Thank you very much. I'm shocked at how much it's surpassed my expectations. It's a beautiful remodeling. I'm certainly glad I asked you to do it.」


％Ｂ
「I'm very happy to hear you're satisfied.」
I'm also satisfied with how the remodeling came out.
I was able to incorporate all of Fukuzawa-san's requests, as well as add my own touch.

I was honestly worried about how my first job as an independent architect would go, and I ended up not being able to sleep some nights because of that.

But now that it's complete, I think it's come out incredibly satisfying.

％Ｂ
「And Mr. Miyamoto, thank you very much for your work.」
I thank the manager of the Miyamoto Group, our contractor for this job.
Miyamoto
「Nah, we're always happy to have work to do. Call us whenever!」

％Ｂ
「Yes, likewise. I'll be counting on you again in the future!」
Miyamoto
「...But you know, you're a really serious guy.」
％Ｂ
「Uh...」
Miyamoto
「There are some design people out there who just hand over the blueprints, and almost never show up to the construction site. If any problems come up, it's all up to us.」


Miyamoto
「But you came to the site every single day. You gave my workers drinks and stuff too. Everyone was real happy.」


Miyamoto
「Your design's amazing, of course, but where I can really tell you're a disciple of Azuma Morio is from how you're on top of all the on-site details.」


％Ｂ
「Oh, no... I just consider building homes to be the same as building connections with people. That's why I try to work together with everyone as much as possible toward the end product...」


Miyamoto
「I'd like to work with someone like you again. I definitely want you to call on me again.」

％Ｂ
「Y-Yes! I certainly will!」
％Ｂ
「...So yeah, the manager of the contracting company praised me.」
Sora
「...I see.」
％Ｂ
「He called me a "disciple of Azuma Morio." Heheh...」
Sora
「...You seem happy.」
％Ｂ
「...Yeah, I am.」
I'm happy for the praise, but I'm more happy about how he referenced my relationship to Azuma-san.

％Ｂ
「Azuma Morio's disciple, eh...」
％Ｂ
「...No, I probably shouldn't get this happy about it. 'Cause my goal's to become an architect someone can strive to be like, like Teacher is.」


I still have a long way to go if I'm this happy.
Sora
「...If you're happy, then you should be happy. You still were acknowledged for your work.」

％Ｂ
「You think so? Yeah, that's true... Heheh. Anyway, my first job's done with now. We'll celebrate once your show starts up.」


Sora
「...*nod*」
Sora
「...I've been thinking about what to do for the celebration too.」
She goes red a little for some reason.
I was assuming it was just going to be a bit of a fancy dinner, but maybe she's thinking of something else...?

Sora
「...I'm going to continue now.」
％Ｂ
「Y-Yeah, right.」
all
I was talking about how the remodeling went as a bit of a break just now, but I'm here at the park tonight with Sora to help her with practicing for the new planetarium show.


％Ｂ
「The moon's looking just about perfect now too.」
It was cloudy earlier, but now the sky's clearer and we can see the moon floating beautifully in the night.

％Ｂ
「All right, keep going then.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
Sora
「...Now then, let's discuss legends involving the moon next. Are you all familiar with the goddess of the moon? We bunnies share the moon with a goddess.」


Sora reads from her script as if she were giving the actual show narration.

Narrating from the perspective of an actual denizen of the moon really is new and fun.
Sora's tone sounds softer and gentler than usual because of the way she sounds like she's talking about her homeland.

Sora
「...The goddess's name is Artemis. She is a goddess of the moon, and also of the hunt.」

％Ｂ
「Mhm, mhm...」
Sora
「...At the same time, Artemis is also known as the virgin goddess.」

％Ｂ
「...Mhm?」
...That was kind of a weird fact just now.
Was that really necessary...?
Sora
「Artemis always had her bow and arrow as she ran through the hills and valleys with her retinue of nymphs. She was a goddess of the hunt, but she was also a protector of the weak, such as wild animals and children.」


Sora
「However, her pure nature as a virgin goddess also gave her a colder side.」

Ah, I get it.
So that's where the virgin part comes in.
Sora
「There was once a young hunter named Actaeon. He kept fifty hunting dogs, and his skill as a hunter was said to be greater than Artemis'.」


Fifty dogs...
Actaeon must've had a lot of trouble feeding them all...
Sora
「One day, during a hunt, Actaeon accidentally happened to see Artemis naked while she was bathing.」

Oh man, Actaeon's a lucky guy!
Got to see the virgin goddess naked!
Sora
「Artemis turned Actaeon into a deer in her anger.」

W-Well... I guess I can understand why she was angry...
But I don't think she had to go that far...
It was just an accident...
Sora
「Actaeon's fifty hunting dogs leapt upon the deer before them, not knowing that it was their master, and they ate him.」


％Ｂ
「Wha...!?」
Actaeoooon!?
Sora
「...That is one story about the goddess of the moon.」
％Ｂ
「U-Uh, you know... Maybe you should cut out that part about Artemis...」

Sora
「...It's not good?」
％Ｂ
「It's more like... I feel like a brutal story like that might leave a bad impression on the kids...」

Sora
「...A moving tale of self-sacrifice involving the moon, then.」
That seems kinda shady too...
％Ｂ
「Give me a summary.」
Sora
「...In Indian legend, the identity of the moon bunny is a bunny who threw itself into a fire to feed a starving old man―」


％Ｂ
「That's exactly what I was talking about when I said brutal...」
Would anyone be interested in the moon after hearing that story?
Looks like there's still a ways to go before the program's finalized...
