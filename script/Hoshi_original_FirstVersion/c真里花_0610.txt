「Fuah...」
I've been so tired all day. We were up working pretty late last night.
Which means that lunch time is nap time, of course.
...Poke poke.
％Ｂ
「...Hm?」
I sit up drowsily when someone pokes my back.
Rikka
「Class is starting.」
％Ｂ
「Ack... It's already time?」
Rikka
「You've looked sleepy all morning. Did you stay up late?」

％Ｂ
「A bit, yeah.」
Rikka
「...Is that paint on your hands?」
I only realize once she points it out.
My fingertips are covered in paint.
Rikka
「So you stayed up late to paint? I don't remember you saying you were in the art club.」

％Ｂ
「No, I'm in the event...」
all
I lay myself back down in front of the curious-looking Narusawa.

％Ｂ
「You'll know soon enough. 
Fufufu... Fuaaah～ Mnmnh...」

I wanna show everyone my image so badly.
I need to store energy for when I do.
Rikka
「...Class is starting, you know.」
all
％Ｂ
「Here's... the stargazing aquarium that I envisioned!」
I can see everyone's eyes light up when I show them the sketch.

Misa
「This... is wonderful!」
Sora
「...The fish are swimming in the sky.」
Ousaka's got her gaze fixed intently on the sketch. She seems really interested.
％Ｂ
「It looks that way, right? That's one of the aims.」

all
Natsuki
「Huh, I like it! So this is the combination planetarium and aquarium that you were talking about

, Hino

?」
Segawa seems really interested too. She's taking lots of photos.
Shuuichi
「I see, so this is what you meant. The drawing does a good job of explaining. You're right, this isn't bad.」


％Ｂ
「Right?」
all
Marika
「Looks like everyone likes it... That's great.」

％Ｂ
「It's all thanks to you, Shinozaki. You gave me the hint.」

Marika
「I don't think I did anything～ ...But I'm really glad.」

She smiles in relief.
all
％Ｂ
「The plan is to arrange water tanks in a circle, and project a planetarium above people's heads at the same time.」

％Ｂ
「As if you were looking up at a starry sky from inside the sea... I was going for a bit of an unreal experience. What do you guys think?」


I ask the others for their opinions.
Natsuki
「Yeah, I think that sounds good～ Sounds like a romantic plan to me.」

all
Misa
「I also think that it sounds wonderful!」
Sora
「No complaints.」
％Ｂ
「Now then... What do you think, Shuuichi?」
all
Shuuichi
「Hm... Hm... Hmmmm...」
％Ｂ
「What's that face for? You should be like, "You've gone somewhere I can't reach, ％Ｂ! Please, stay my friend forever!"」


Shuuichi
「Why would I say that!? How pathetic do you think I am!?」
Shuuichi
「I think it's a good idea too... but looking at the number of tanks and their placements, I think it'll be a pretty large-scale construction.」


all
Misa
「Yes, that's true... You would need quite the amount of space to put down this many tanks. Much more than the second chemistry classroom could allow, at least.」


Marika
「What? Why is that?」
Misa
「The desks in that room are fixed to the floor, and cannot be moved.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, now that you mention it...」
all
It's because those desks have water pipes connected to them.
My plan was to have the water tanks set up along the classroom perimeter.
Those fixed desks would be in the way.
Natsuki
「How about the astronomy club, then?」
Sora
「Can't. That room is pretty much a closet.」

Shuuichi
「Doesn't sound like you'd have enough space.」
all
Marika
「We could borrow an open classroom, since it'll just be during the festival... Maybe?」

％Ｂ
「I guess we'll have to negotiate that.」
all
We all turn toward Shuuichi.
Shuuichi
「Tch... Fine, sure...」
％Ｂ
「Thanks for saying you'll reserve the principal's office for us.」
Shuuichi
「I never said that!」
Shuuichi
「Though I think I'll be able to find an open classroom, at least. I doubt you'll get anywhere nice, though...」

％Ｂ
「No, that won't do. If we're gonna do it, it has to be somewhere with lots of people.」

Shuuichi
「Oh, come on. Don't be ridiculous. How are you going to find a place like that at this point?」


Misa
「I believe it will be quite the preparation, so somewhere we could borrow for a while would be nice...」

all
Natsuki
「Especially since it doesn't seem like the kinda thing you could just set up the day before, and then take down as soon as it's over.」

Marika
「I wonder if there's anywhere that'd be perfect for that～?」
all
Shuuichi
「No, I really don't think...」
Shuuichi doesn't seem too enthusiastic.
I get how he feels, but...
％Ｂ
「It's a big problem for sure, but we shouldn't give up hope just yet.」
Shuuichi
「...Do you have a place in mind or something?」
％Ｂ
「Just an idea. I dunno if it'll work out yet, so could you give me some time?」

all
There's a spot that's perfect for this plan.
The question is whether its owner will allow us to use it...
Touko
「Of course not.」
％Ｂ
「...Figured.」
She said no, just like I... actually, even more strongly than I thought she would.
I thought this old school building would work perfectly, too.
Touko
「I like this spot because it's quiet and comfortable. It'd ruin everything if you did that.」

％Ｂ
「Just let me give you some more details. It's a really good plan. Could you take a look at this sketch?」


I unfold the sketch that Shinozaki and I made.
It's the same one that got everyone excited for the idea earlier.
Touko
「A drawing doesn't do much for me.」
％Ｂ
「...You're kidding me.」
It's our masterpiece that moved the hearts of the others, but it apparently has no effect on Yukimura's.

％Ｂ
「I didn't know she had such a frigid heart...」
Touko
「I can hear you, you know.」
...Crap?
Touko
「And if anything, I'm more on the sensitive side.」
％Ｂ
「!?」
Touko
「Well anyway, they're not going to let you use this building.」
％Ｂ
「You don't know until you try.」
Touko
「I do.」
％Ｂ
「You seem pretty sure. I'll do something about getting permission, so I want you to think about it.」


Touko
「Why are you asking me? Why not just go get the school's permission, if you're so confident?」


％Ｂ
「I want to get permission from this building's resident before I get the school's permission.」

Touko
「Why do you care so much about me? It's not like I have a legitimate right to be here. So why do you want my permission so badly?」


％Ｂ
「What kinda reasoning is that? This building's important to someone, so of course I'm gonna ask that person for permission.」


all
It's just what you do when you want to borrow the use of a place that someone treasures.
Touko
「...」
Or so I think...
But Yukimura just looks blankly at me.
Touko
「You're a weird guy.」
％Ｂ
「Am I?」
Touko
「Anyway, my permission doesn't mean anything. There's no point in asking or convincing me. Now leave already.」


％Ｂ
「Got it. I'll leave for today, but I'll come again.」

Touko
「Let me know when you're doing that. I'll lock the door.」

％Ｂ
「Gh...」
