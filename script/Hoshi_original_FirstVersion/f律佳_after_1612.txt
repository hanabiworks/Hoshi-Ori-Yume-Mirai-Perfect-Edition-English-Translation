It's December. The last month of the first year Rikka and I have spent living together.
％Ｂ
「Rikka, congratulations on getting first place at the Hama Contest!」
Rikka
「Hyah!? Ehehe, thank you.」
She jumps at the sound of the party popper, but she immediately smiles at me.

They had the award ceremony the other day, and she got snatched away by news programs and talk shows immediately afterward.

Rikka became an instant celebrity.
％Ｂ
「You're completely famous. You were on TV just this morning.」

I grab the remote and turn on the TV.
Host
『Today's special guest is none other than the first Japanese pianist to win the Hama Contest, Narusawa Rikka-san!』
Rikka
『I'm Narusawa Rikka. Thank you very much for having me on the show.』
Host
『So I hear you're still a university student! Wow, that's amazing! First off, congratulations.』

Rikka
『Thank you very much.』
Host
『You'll be performing live for us today, yes? I've listened to your performance from the contest. It was so inspiring!』


Rikka
「Aah, uuuh... You actually recorded it?」
She's turned red looking at herself on the TV.
％Ｂ
「I make sure I watch and record everything you're on. Haha, I'm just so happy for you.」

Rikka
「...Geez. You're so obsessed with your girlfriend. It's just for now. They're fawning over me because it's a rarity, so it'll settle down soon.」

all
It's probably a temporary thing, just like she says.
It's like that time a student won first place in an internationally renowned Swiss ballet contest. The TV and newspaper coverage ended within the week.
There isn't that much appreciation for the arts in the hearts of the general public.
But this is a huge step forward for Rikka for sure.
％Ｂ
「But are you sure you're okay with eating my food to celebrate? We could go big and spend a bunch...」

Rikka
「Your cooking would be far better than any restaurant's, no matter how expensive and famous it is. Getting to eat together with you is what makes me happy.」
％Ｂ
「Then I should've at least made something a little more impressive.」
The food on the table's just the usual stuff I make when Rikka's busy.

A totally normal everyday meal.
Rikka
「The usual is fine. I think it'd be a good idea to start saving money now too...」


Start saving now...
I know what that means.
％Ｂ
「Yeah, let's save up.」
We both have the same destination in mind.
It's up to our future to dictate exactly where we end up.
Rikka's steadily moving along toward her goal.
I've gotta do my best to become an architect too.
Not just any architect. One who's well known throughout the world, like Mr. Azuma.

It's an incredibly lofty, faraway goal.
Rikka
「You see, I was thinking about you before the contest. It made me feel like you were right there beside me, and I was able to have so much fun playing... and that's how I ended up with the result I got.」


Rikka
「I... can do my best if you're there for me. Hehe.」
It isn't dependence, but coexistence.
The two of us share the same destiny.
And I feel the same way... I just feel like I can do anything, as long as I can see Rikka's smile by my side.
And if I want to achieve my goal, I'll need to get Mr. Azuma to approve of me first.
And one day...
No. I can't be vague and just say "one day."
I'll become a full-fledged employee by moving up the ranks before I graduate university, and then...
Rikka
「Hehehe. This tastes great.」
I look at her left ring finger.
It's bare for now.
But when the time comes, I want to place a glittering ring there―
