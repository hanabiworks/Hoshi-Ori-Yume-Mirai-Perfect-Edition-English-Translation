And so the weekend arrives...
％Ｂ
「...Thank you for the food.」
I eat the impressive food that's been set out at Marika's place.
I thought I'd be too nervous to taste it...
But of course, Yumi-san's cooking is delicious.
Yumi
「Go on, eat up. Oh? You're already done with your rice? Do you want seconds?」

％Ｂ
「Thank you very much. Then... another bowl, please...」

Kouji
「...I'm surprised you have an appetite like that at another family's house.」
％Ｂ
「Uh... N-No...」
Marika
「Geez～ What are you saying? You're the one who told me to invite him over for dinner, weren't you?」

all
Kouji
「I did, but I didn't say he should eat everything we've got. He should learn at least a little restraint.」

Kouji
「Don't you think a man who eats and eats just because it's dinner is still immature?」

％Ｂ
「Y-You're right... I understand.」
I pull back my arm that had been holding the bowl out to Yumi-san.
Marika snatches it away from me.
Marika
「Don't worry about that. I'll go get you another bowl of rice.」

all
％Ｂ
「Uh...」
Kouji
「...」
And so she just takes my bowl.
Her dad's eyes are scaring me...
％Ｂ
「Oh, w-would you like me... to pour your beer for you?」
Kouji
「We have a rule in this house that you pour your second beer and onward yourself.」
％Ｂ
「I don't remember a rule like that.」
Kouji
「We have it starting today.」
He grabs his beer and pours it himself before I could extend a hand toward it.
H-He's being so difficult...
I ended up just joining them for dinner... but I guess he's telling me I should just say it already?

％Ｂ
「E-Excuse me...!」
Marika
「Here you go, rice～」
％Ｂ
「Uh... Well, um...」
all
Kouji
「...You eat when it's time to eat. That's another rule for our house. Remember that well.」


％Ｂ
「...O-Okay...」
Marika
「Dad, stop drinking and eat too! We'll never be able to clear the table like this～」

all
Kouji
「Hmph... Pfaaah...」
What to do...
I just can't seem to find a good moment to talk about us getting married.
I wonder how you're supposed to say something like this.
Kouji
「Phew... I might've drunk a bit too much.」
He's already completely red in the face.
He looks pretty drunk. Is he going to be okay?
Kouji
「We've ended up knowing each other for quite some time, despite our differences...」
％Ｂ
「Yes... we have. It's been a while since I moved back here...」

Kouji
「...How long have you and Marika been dating now?」

％Ｂ
「Well... Nine years.」
Kouji
「I see... It's been a while...」
％Ｂ
「Yes, which I'm grateful for.」
Kouji
「...」
％Ｂ
「...Um, Father.」
I sit upright.
I'm gonna try to bring up the main topic.
Kouji
「...You should drink a little too.」
％Ｂ
「Wha, oh... Yes, I'd love to.」
He hands me the beer bottle.
But it's empty.
Kouji
「Wait, what? It's empty already. Heeey, Marika. Bring us some more.」

Marika
「Another one～? You're drinking a bit too much, Dad.」
Kouji
「Just get us one.」
Marika
「You need to watch how much you drink, you know. This is the last one, okay?」

all
She reluctantly brings us another beer bottle.
Kouji
「Oh, and Marika. It's getting late, so you should take a bath now.」

Marika
「Whaaat～? I don't think it's that late yet...」
Kouji
「What are you talking about? You have to wake up early tomorrow. There's nothing to lose from resting early.」

Marika
「You always treat me like a kid. Okay, Ryousuke, I'll see you afterward. Don't drink too much, okay?」


Marika
「You always treat me like a kid. I'll see you afterward. Don't drink too much, okay?」


％Ｂ
「R-Right.」
all
Marika smiles, and then leaves the room so it's just us two.
We both pour ourselves beer, but don't drink.
I take another deep breath.
％Ｂ
「...Father, um...」
Kouji
「Hino-kun.」
Kouji
「Hey.」
He speaks at the same time as me.
Kouji
「Could you grab that album off of that shelf?」
％Ｂ
「Album? ...On this shelf?」
Kouji
「Right.」
I find what he's probably referring to on the lower shelves.
％Ｂ
「Did you mean... this?」
Kouji
「Yeah.」
I hold it out, and her father grumpily grabs it.
He doesn't open it right away. He strokes the cover while looking at it with gentle eyes.

％Ｂ
「Is that... an album of Marika's photos?」
Kouji
「It is...」
He gives a short response and finally opens the album.
I peer in from the side.
Which means I'm pretty much sitting beside him.
There's a photo of him and Yumi-san, looking pretty young, and a small baby.

％Ｂ
「Wow, she's so small...」
Kouji
「Marika was always small, ever since she was born. When I first saw her... the first thing that came to mind was the tale of Princess Kaguya.」


％Ｂ
「Princess Kaguya...」
It's a bit of a strange way of phrasing it, but I think I understand what he means.
He must have felt like he discovered a treasure of some kind when he had first seen Marika after she was born.

He turns the pages to reveal photos of Marika growing up.
Her crawling, then standing, reading a picture book, kindergarten, and then grade school...

But all of the photos are indoors.
There are barely any outdoors photos to be seen.
Kouji
「...She was frail back then too.」
He must've guessed my thoughts.
％Ｂ
「Yes... I heard from her about that too.」
Kouji
「These photos are from before we moved to Shionagi. The air where we lived wasn't too good, because it was an industrial area. So we couldn't let her play outside much.」


％Ｂ
「And then you moved over here, right?」
He's told me before about how much trouble he went through for work back then.
It was all for Marika's sake.
Kouji
「I was so sorry for her, that we couldn't have given her a healthy body. In fact, this photo at the shrine here's from when we went to pray for good health.」


Kouji
「It felt like all we could do was ask the divine for help... Being healthy's always been something like me and my family's only saving grace. I remember wondering what I had done wrong...」


％Ｂ
「P-Please don't say things like that. It wasn't anyone's fault... I'm sure of it.」

Kouji
「You're right...」
But his expression doesn't brighten.
What kind of thoughts must have crossed his mind throughout that period back when Marika was so small and frail?

Things are different now that she's healthy.
But I'm sure that things must have been horrible for him, back when there was no guarantee that she'd ever get better.

Kouji
「All I could do for Marika was buy her books. I figured that would be the only thing she could do at home all day...」


Kouji
「But... she slowly changed.」
Kouji
「...Marika suddenly told me that she wanted to start swimming around when she was almost done with grade school.」

％Ｂ
「...That's...」
That happened after I moved away from this town.
Kouji
「I said no at first, of course. I knew that swimming was supposed to be good for people with asthma, but I didn't think she'd be able to keep up with her stamina.」


Kouji
「But Marika was determined. She told me that she wanted to be healthy no matter what. She wanted to play and run around just like the other kids.」


Kouji
「She never said anything like that even once before that...」

Kouji
「Thinking about it now, I think I get it.」
％Ｂ
「Oh...」
Kouji
「She did anything as soon as she heard it helped people deal with asthma. Swimming, choir...」

Kouji
「She probably wanted to catch up to a certain someone.」
There's a gentle smile on his face. I can feel a deep love for Marika from it.\n\r

He must usually look like this when he interacts with Marika.
He's always watched over her with this smile.
％Ｂ
「...Um, Father. There's something I'd like to speak with you about.」

So I straighten my back too.
％Ｂ
「As you know... Marika-san and I have been dating for a long time now.」

Kouji
「...Yeah.」
％Ｂ
「Do you remember what we spoke about before? I swore I'd become a fully fledged man that could make Marika-san happy... and that I would ask you to approve of my relationship with her when that day came.」


％Ｂ
「You may have already heard from Marika, but I'm currently taking the exams to become a first-class architect.」

％Ｂ
「I recently passed the subject portion of the exam, which is the hardest part. There's still the drafting portion left, but I'm planning on passing that too.」

％Ｂ
「So, when I become a first-class architect...」
I bow my head low.
％Ｂ
「I would like to marry Marika-san.」
Kouji
「...」
％Ｂ
「I'll definitely make her happy. I promise. So...」

Kouji
「...Hahhh.」
He exhales, as if something that had been keeping him tensed up had loosened in him.

Kouji
「I bet those words would've sounded a lot more impressive if I had heard them after you passed your first-class architect exams.」

％Ｂ
「Gh... Yes, of course. I apologize for getting the order of events wrong.」

Kouji
「You say you'll definitely pass, but are you sure? It'll be a real disappointment if you screw up at this point.」

％Ｂ
「I understand that...」
Kouji
「And it's not like you're fully fledged just because you've got the qualifications.」

Kouji
「My work's got people who can't do any work, even though they have all these impressive qualifications. Don't you think experience is still important?」


％Ｂ
「I'd like to think I'm doing my best...」
Kouji
「...Well, fine.」
％Ｂ
「Huh?」
Kouji
「I've been watching you for a while now. Ever since you were in high school.」

Kouji
「I know very well that you're not someone that makes promises lightly. I also know that you're a sincere human being. And I know that you honestly care about Marika too.」


％Ｂ
「Oh...」
Kouji
「...You better make sure you make her happy, you hear?」
％Ｂ
「Y-Yes! I swear I will!」
Kouji
「You better not make her cry.」
％Ｂ
「I never would!」
Kouji
「I see...」
That gentle smile appears again.
He slowly lowers his head.
Kouji
「Ryousuke-kun. Please take good care of my daughter.」

Kouji
「Please take good care of my daughter.」
％Ｂ
「Father...」
Kouji
「She's so in love with you she doesn't know what to do with herself... She's always been like that, ever since she was a child. I'm sure that marrying you... would make her happier than anything else.」


Kouji
「Please. Please make Marika the happiest girl in the world. Please... make sure she's always smiling.」

His back is shaking slightly.
I've been entrusted with something enormous.
I straighten my back again without thinking.
％Ｂ
「...Yes. I swear... I'll make Marika happy.」
I lower my head toward him again.
My vision blurs.
Maybe her father's tears are contagious.
Marika
「Whaaat? What are you two doing?」
The two of us look up at Marika's surprised voice.
Marika
「...A-Are you crying? Why～?」
％Ｂ
「It-It's nothing.」
I wipe my tears.
Marika must have realized something. She smiles gently at the two of us.
Marika
「Do you two want another drink? I'll pour.」

Kouji
「It's a rule in our household that the second drink onward is...」
Marika
「Geez, who cares about that? Here you go.」

Kouji
「R-Right, then... Let's have another. Here... Ryousuke, you should drink too.」

Kouji
「R-Right, then... Let's have another. Here, you should drink too.」

all
％Ｂ
「O-Okay...」
He holds out a glass of beer for me.
It suddenly feels like we've really become father and son. I'm just so happy.

Yumi
「And so he ended up passing out drunk.」
We went through a lot of beer after that...
And Marika's dad ended up falling asleep face down on the table.
％Ｂ
「He had already drunk a lot... I think he must have been nervous too.」

Marika
「Sorry you had to put up with him.」
％Ｂ
「No, it's totally fine. I'm glad I got to hear lots of stories about you.」

all
％Ｂ
「Um, Mother. I'm... sorry for being late with this announcement, but...」

Yumi
「Oh? What might it be?」
％Ｂ
「I'd like to marry Marika-san. I promise you I'll make her happy. Please, approve of our relationship.」


I formally let her mother know too.
Yumi
「Ryousuke-kun. Raise your head.」
Yumi
「Raise your head.」
％Ｂ
「Y-Yes... Oh.」

She grabs my hand tightly.
I look at her. I think I can see tears welling up in her eyes.
Yumi
「Please... take good care of Marika.」
％Ｂ
「Oh...」
Yumi
「Fufu～ Good for you, Marika. I'm all happy now. I know! We need to think about the ceremony!」


Marika
「A-Ahaha～ I was going to say we should think about that after...」
Yumi-san's smile is the same as always.
But I know that she gave me something important just now.
％Ｂ
「Um. You too... Marika.」

I put my heart into her wonderful name.
Marika
「O-Okay.」
％Ｂ
「I'll say it again. Will you... marry me?」

I say those words again.
Marika
「Wh-What's gotten into you?」
％Ｂ
「I wanted to say it again, properly. I swear I'll make you happy. I might not be a dependable man yet, but I promise.」


Marika
「...Yes. If you're okay with me... then please make me your bride.」

％Ｂ
「And I'll become a man that can make your mom and dad happy too.」

Yumi
「Oh? You mean...」
Marika
「Huh? My... mom and dad?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. Your mom and dad, Marika. The people who've raised and protected you all this time.」

％Ｂ
「I think that this time, I'll... we'll want to repay the favor to them... Is that weird?」


Marika
「...No, it's not weird. It makes me happy.」

Marika's eyes sparkle with tears.
Marika
「And I'll do my best... to make you, and your mom and dad happy too, Ryousuke.」

Marika
「And I'll do my best... to make you, and your mom and dad happy too.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah. Let's make everyone important to us happy, together.」
Marika
「Yeah!」
I want to make Marika happy.
And I want to make the people around Marika happy too.
I think it'd be nice if we could go on creating more happiness by us being together.\n\r

I want to build a family with Marika like that.
