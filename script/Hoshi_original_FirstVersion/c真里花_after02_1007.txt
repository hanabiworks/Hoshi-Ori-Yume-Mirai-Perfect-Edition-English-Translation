％Ｂ
「Thank you very much for today!!」
I swiftly slot in my time card.
Firm Staff A
「Oh? You're leaving pretty early today.」
％Ｂ
「I'm sorry, but I have some plans today.」
Azuma
「It has to be a woman.」
％Ｂ
「You're right on the mark, but that doesn't bother me anymore. And it's not just any woman. It's my wife.」

all
Firm Staff A
「Dammit, he's showing off his newlywed-ness again!」
％Ｂ
「You should hurry and get married too. Please. Anyway, thank you very much!」

％Ｂ
「I'm hooome.」
Marika
「Welcome hooome♪」
％Ｂ
「...What?」
I don't know what to say.
...A bunny?
Marika
「H-Huh～? ...Did I surprise you? Th-That's weird～ I thought... something like this would make you happy～」


％Ｂ
「Are those... bunnygirl ears?」
Marika
「Y-Yeah, they are... I heard somewhere that cosplaying might be a good way to celebrate a man's birthday... And you liked it back when I did that Alice cosplay before too～」


Oh, whoops. Marika looks a little worried.
％Ｂ
「Marika!」
Marika
「Y-Yeeees～」
％Ｂ
「I was just surprised... 'cause I didn't think you'd ever do something like that yourself. Um... It looks really good on you.」


Marika
「Really? Am I cute?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, you are. I think you're the cutest bunny in the world.」

Marika
「Wh-Whaaat? ...I think that's exaggerating... since real bunnies are cuter...」

％Ｂ
「Nope. You're cuter.」
Marika
「Oh really... I-I'm glad～」
She sighs in relief.
She's always so worried...
％Ｂ
「Then, Marika!」
Marika
「Y-Yes!」
％Ｂ
「Thank you.」
Marika
「A-Aahh～」
I hug her tight.
She clings to me feebly.
％Ｂ
「You wanting to make me happy makes me happy. Um, well...」

It's a little embarrassing, but I look Marika in the eye and smile right at her.
％Ｂ
「I love you, Marika.」
Marika
「Mmh... Chu...」
And we kiss.
Marika
「W-Wah～ ...I-I'm so happy～」
Marika
「Hnnhh, it was embarrassing, but I'm glad I tried this～」

Marika
「I was so worried that you might be creeped out～」
％Ｂ
「What are you talking about? I was surprised, but that was just 'cause it was sudden.」

％Ｂ
「There's no way I'd be creeped out by anything you did, Marika... 'cause I love you.」

Marika
「Mhm... Mhm...」
％Ｂ
「Wait, what? ...Y-You're gonna cry?」
Marika
「I'm not crying... because I'm happy. My eyes are just all watery because I'm a bunny rabbit...」

Marika
「E-Ehehehe.」
She wipes at her eyes and smiles.
Marika
「Oh, then... Please, come inside... I'll take your bag for you too.」

％Ｂ
「Oh, thanks. Here you go, then.」
Marika
「Wow, it's so heavy～」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, I've got my laptop in there today. It's supposed to be a pretty light one, but...」

Marika
「Whaaat? I'd dislocate my shoulder if I had to carry this around.」
％Ｂ
「Your bag's plenty heavy too, though.」
Marika
「Whaaat, it's nothing like this... It's not that heavy, because it's mostly little things inside.」

She then heaves my bag along.
Marika
「Here we go... Hehehe. Thanks for all your hard work.」
Marika
「Oh, I'll take your necktie too!」
％Ｂ
「You're even gonna do that?」
Marika
「Yep! Because today's your birthday! You can let the bunny handle everything!」

％Ｂ
「Then please.」
I stick my chest out so she can take my necktie.
Marika
「O-Okaay... U-Umm... This goes here, and that goes there, so...」


She looks a little lost on what to do with the necktie.
Marika
「L-Like this!」
Squeeze!
％Ｂ
「Guegh!」
Marika
「A-Aaahhh! I'm sorry, I tightened it～!」

Marika
「You pull this one, right? Ahaha...!」
She frantically loosens my tie.
％Ｂ
「I was almost killed by my own wife...」
Marika
「That's not true, it wasn't on purpose～」
Marika
「A-Ahahaha... Your necktie is now off～ I will also be taking your suit～」

all
She laughs to try to smooth it over and takes my jacket from me.
She neatly places it on a hanger.
Marika
「Then, p-please～ ...Have a seat～」
％Ｂ
「Okaaay.」
Marika
「As you can see, dinner is also ready.」
％Ｂ
「Whoah!?」
all
I sit down at the living room table.
There are lots of dishes laid out. They look good enough to be served at a hotel restaurant.

Marika
「Ehehe! I did my best.」
Marika
「Umm, this is salmon and celery marinade. You like salmon, right?」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, I love it. It looks really good with the fat still on it. What are these little green things?」

Marika
「They're capers. It apparently makes for a good accent to the flavor.」
Marika
「And also, some corn potage soup.」
％Ｂ
「Whoa, it's so thick...」
Marika
「The mixer we got as a wedding present really came in handy.」
Marika
「And for the main course, roast beef...ish!」
％Ｂ
「Roast beef-ish?」
Marika
「Yeah. You need an oven to make real roast beef... but you can make something kind of like it with aluminum foil and a frying pan. So it's roast beef-ish.」


％Ｂ
「Wow... But it looks good.」
The cut face of the meat is just slightly pink.
It looks moist and soft.
Marika
「And, and, I have a drink too. Bubbly bubbly champagne!」

％Ｂ
「Whoaaah! That's awesome!」
Marika
「I asked the employee at the store what kind would be easy to drink. This is only 3 percent alcohol, and it's apparently crisp and sweet. That way, I thought I'd be able to drink it too...」


％Ｂ
「Oh? You're gonna drink with me today?」
Marika
「Yeah, since it's a special occasion.」
Marika
「I thought it'd be nice... if we could make a toast with the same drink.」
％Ｂ
「Really... That makes me so happy. Thank you. This must've been a ton of work, right?」

Marika
「It just became really fun while I was doing it, so it just got more and more elaborate. So, yeah, it was a lot of work, but it was also so much fun～♪」


％Ｂ
「You're just so cute, and so capable... You're the best bunny in the universe.」

Marika
「Hehe... Then that cute bunny's going to pour this for you. Oh, I need to open this cork first.」

Bunny Marika grabs the champagne.
She puts her fingers on the cork, and uses all her strength to...
Marika
「...Huh? I can't get it out... Just a second. Hnnnnghhh...」

％Ｂ
「You sure you can do it? Want me to help?」

Marika
「It-It's okay! It's almost out～! Hnnnnnnnnghhh...!」

all
Shhpop!!
Marika
「It's out!!」
％Ｂ
「Oh, Marika, watch out...!」
Marika
「Nyah!?」
all
The champagne cork bounces and hits her forehead directly.

％Ｂ
「Y-You okay!?」
Marika
「Piiiih～～～～ ...I-I'm okay... It didn't hurt that much... It was just surprising...」

Marika
「But I said "Nyah" even though I'm a bunny... I wonder what would've been the correct thing to say...」

％Ｂ
「What? That's what you're worried about?」
Watching her flush red as she puzzles over that's just adorable.

Marika
「Please go "there there"～」
％Ｂ
「There, there, Marika. That hurt, didn't it?」

I pet her forehead.
Marika
「Hehe... I'm okay now!」
She cheers up immediately.
Marika
「Oh, then, I'll get the glasses. The freezer, the freezer...」

all
She struts over to the kitchen and grabs glasses for the two of us.\n\r

The two glasses have been chilled completely in the freezer.
Marika
「I'll start pouring the drinks then!」
％Ｂ
「Hmmmh, it just all feels so high class...」
Marika
「These are the glasses we got from Narusawa-san as a wedding present. They're apparently a famous European brand.」

％Ｂ
「You just gotta hand it to people like her who know their stuff like that.」
Marika
「They look really nice, don't they? I think they're perfect for something like this.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah. We'll have to thank Narusawa when we see her.」
Marika
「And so...」
Marika
「Mhm... Then... to celebrate Ryousuke's birthday... Cheers!」
Marika
「Mhm... Then... to celebrate your birthday... Cheers!」
％Ｂ
「Cheers!」
We gently clink our glasses together.
The celebratory sound echoes through the room.
Marika
「Nkh, nkh... Oh, this is so good!」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, it is. It's sweet, but not too much...」
Marika
「It's like high-class grape juice. I can drink this.」

％Ｂ
「You'll still get drunk if you drink too much, you know.」
Marika
「It's okay, I'm an adult～」
She giggles and sips at the champagne.
Marika
「Please feel free to eat the food too.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, I'll dig in!」
％Ｂ
「So many choices... but I'll start with the meat.」
Marika
「I know you like your meat. I'll cut it for you. How much do you want?」

％Ｂ
「I want a really thick piece.」
Marika
「Whaaat? About this much?」
％Ｂ
「No, I'm talking like, centimeters thick.」
Marika
「This much? Will this fit in your mouth?」
％Ｂ
「Easy-peasy. Here, just jam it in.」
Marika
「Then... here you go. Say "ahhh"...」

She cuts the meat and carefully holds it out to me.
％Ｂ
「Hamh...!」
Marika
「Wow! In one mouthful!」
％Ｂ
「Mgmgh... It's good! This tastes pretty refreshing too.」

Marika
「Yeah, because it's red meat, so it doesn't have as many calories as you'd expect. The seasoning is mostly soy sauce, so it's refreshing too.」

％Ｂ
「Mhm, mhm. It tastes great.」
％Ｂ
「Then I think I'll cut your portion too.」
Marika
「Oh, then please do～」
％Ｂ
「Uhh, is about this thick a piece okay?」
Marika
「Mmm, I think a little less might be nice...」
％Ｂ
「Huh? Like this? It's only about a millimeter thick...」

Marika
「This bunny rabbit's mouth is small.」
％Ｂ
「That's true. Then here...」
Marika
「Ahhh...」
Marika
「Oh, it's so good!」
She smiles as she chews with her little mouth.
She really looks like a bunny.
％Ｂ
「This salmon's incredible too. I love the sharp taste of the capers.」
Marika
「Really? How do you like the soup?」
％Ｂ
「Slurp... Mm, it's good! It's thick, like the kind you'd get at a restaurant. You have some too, Marika. I'll cool it off for you.」


％Ｂ
「Fhh, fhh... Say "ahhh."」
Marika
「Ahaha, thank yooou. Ahhh～」
all
We enjoy the lavish feast.
We smile all the way through dinnertime.
％Ｂ
「Phew... And I'm done.」
Marika
「Yes, me too.」
I figured it'd take a while, since there was a lot of food, and we were taking our time to enjoy it...\n\r

But we had finished our dinner before I knew it.
I just couldn't stop eating with how good it was.
Marika
「I have cake for dessert. Oh, but we just ate, so... maybe it could wait until the food's settled a bit?」


％Ｂ
「Nah, I'll have it now. Sweet things and your cakes go in a different stomach.」

Marika
「Oh, I get what you mean～ Then wait just a second, okay?」
She starts rummaging about the kitchen.
Eventually...
Marika
「Happy birthday to you♪ Happy birthday to you♪」

She carries over a smallish cake with candles on it.

all
％Ｂ
「Fhhh!」
Marika
「Wow～! Clap clap clap... Congratulations～!」
She hops up and down when I blow out the candles.

％Ｂ
「But did you make this, Marika? Wow...」

It looks pretty extravagant with all these fruits, and it's got lots of cute little added touches too...\n\r

I can tell this must've taken quite a lot of effort to make.
Marika
「This is you, Ryousuke. I tried drawing this with frosting.」
Marika
「This is you. I tried drawing this with frosting.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, wow... And this is you next to me.」
Marika
「It's supposed to be... but I'm not too good with my hands, so it might not look like us...」


％Ｂ
「That's not true, I can totally tell it's us.」
Marika
「Oh, and this...」
％Ｂ
「It's... a birthday card?」
Marika
「Mhm. Can I read it out loud?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. I wanna hear.」
She holds out a handmade birthday card.
She flips it open to reveal a hand-drawn illustration and a message.

Marika
「"Happy birthday!!!\nI'm very happy to celebrate your birthday with you as your wife for the first time."」


Marika
「"Thank you so much for making me your wife. Please let me keep celebrating your birthday from now on, too. Please let me be with you forever and ever."」


％Ｂ
「Marika...」
Marika
「Ahaha, it's kind of embarrassing...」
Her message warms my heart.
I accept the birthday card from her and read it over and over to myself.
I'll definitely treasure this for the rest of my life.
Marika
「Here, have some cake♪」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, of course.」
all
She neatly cuts it into slices.
I immediately have some.
％Ｂ
「It's delicious! It's got this fluffy texture, and it's kinda light...」

Marika
「I heard men like it less sweet. I also made it so you can taste the alcohol a little more.」

％Ｂ
「So that's what this fragrance is. Mmm, it's amazing. There's really nothing more I can say...」

Marika
「I'm so happy～ I'll have some too, then!」

Marika also takes a bite of cake.
Marika
「It's just a bit sweet～」
She smiles blissfully.
all
％Ｂ
「...I'm so glad I married you, Marika.」
I say it quietly once caketime comes to a close.
Marika
「Whaaat? Why say that all of a sudden?」
％Ｂ
「It just came to mind right now. Or more like... I always think that.」

％Ｂ
「You're the best bunny in the world, but at the same time, you're the best wife in the world. Yup, yup.」

Marika
「Ahaha... Are you drunk?」
Marika
「But... I feel the same way. I think you're the best husband in the world.」

She smiles cheerfully.
And then she drinks down the remaining champagne.
Marika
「Ahhh～ ...I think I might be a bit drunk too...」
Her cheeks are slightly flushed.
It's really sexy.
Marika
「It's getting a little hot...」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, you're right...」
We inch closer as we whisper to each other.
Before we know it, we're right up against one another.
Marika
「Mmh... Mmchu, chu... mlmlh... chu... nnh... Hehe... This is just a bit sweet too... Slrp, chu, mmlhh... Chuph, mmchu...」


We playfully lick at each other's lips.
We kiss each other's cheeks and lips, lick at our noses...
Marika
「...Nnh... Ahn, nh, afh...」
And I touch her body, enjoying the round softness.
Marika
「Mmlh, chuuuh... Mmfh... Your tongue... tastes so good...」

％Ｂ
「You can lick it as much as you want. And I'll do the same...」
Marika
「Mmchu, chu... Slurp... Chu... Mlh, chu, slurp... Chuph, mmchu...」

It's more like we're sucking on each other's tongues than licking.
Marika's saliva is flowing into my mouth.\n\r
I just can't get enough of how much of a mess we're making on each other's mouths as we show our love.
Marika
「Hauh～」
Marika's cheeks are completely flushed.
And it isn't just because of the alcohol...
％Ｂ
「Marika... I wanna have sex.」
Marika
「M-Mhm... I would... also like to...」
I hold her gently.
She entrusts her small frame to me without resisting.
Marika
「U-Um... This costume... has more to it. It's not just the ears...」

％Ｂ
「Wha... R-Really?」
Marika
「Mhm, um, the whole thing was a bit embarrassing, so I only put on the ears, but...」

％Ｂ
「I wanna see! I wanna see! Show me the full bunny!」

Marika
「A-Ahaha～ ...Really～?」
Marika
「Okay, then as a special birthday treat... please play nice... with me as a bunny...」
