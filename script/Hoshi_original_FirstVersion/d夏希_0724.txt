I'm at the park with Natsuki.
There's no one else here, and there aren't many streetlights around either.
This should be a good spot for getting photos of the stars.
Natsuki
「...This is... kinda exciting, isn't it?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. I hope we can get some good photos.」
Natsuki
「Huh? O-Ohh, yeah, photos. I'm really excited about taking photos.」

％Ｂ
「...」
...Sure wonder what my girlfriend was actually getting so excited about.
Natsuki
「Okay now, let's get ready～」
all
She starts setting up her camera, as if to try to distract me.
Though once she actually places her hands on her camera, her eyes turn serious.
She sets up the tripod and attaches the camera.
It's not the usual digital camera. It's a film camera she brought from home.

％Ｂ
「You've used film cameras before?」
Natsuki
「Of cooourse I have. A true professional isn't defined by their tools, right? You have to be able to handle any and all kinds of cameras to be a first-rate cameraman.」


％Ｂ
「I guess that makes sense... Oh, so can you develop them too?」

Natsuki
「I'd wanna try it sometime.」
％Ｂ
「So you can't...」
Natsuki
「I don't have the equipment. The school's photography club is mostly digital at this point too.」

％Ｂ
「That's pretty tough then...」
all
There isn't anything I can help with yet, so I take a step back so I don't get in her way.

I look up at the night sky and see a scattering of stars overhead.
...I have no idea which ones are part of which constellations...
I wonder how people back then were able to see animals and stuff in them.

Now that I think about it, Natsuki specifically switched to a film camera for this. Can you not take photos of these with a digital camera?

I grab my phone and point it upward.
％Ｂ
「...Yeah, this is terrible.」
I can barely see any stars in the picture I took.
It's just pitch black.
％Ｂ
「So you can't take photos of stars with a digital camera?」
Natsuki
「It's not like it's impossible, but I can't with mine. Or more like, I don't want to. It'll be filled with noise. Not the kinda photo I'd want others to see.」


Natsuki
「And I think the softness of starlight comes out nicer on film.」

％Ｂ
「Is that how it works?」
Natsuki
「For me, at least. I try to follow the way I feel for things like these.」

％Ｂ
「The softness of starlight... I don't really get it...」
Natsuki
「You'll see if you compare later.」
all
She continues setting up her camera.
％Ｂ
「Hey... What's that cable that's coming out from the camera?」
Natsuki
「This? It's a remote shutter release. It's kinda like a remote that lets you press the shutter button from a little further away?」

％Ｂ
「So you can control the shutter with that?」
Natsuki
「Right. And I can use this to keep the shutter open.」

Natsuki
「You need to take longer exposures than normal when you take photos of stars. Which means I'll be keeping the shutter open for a long time.」

Natsuki
「With the remote shutter release, I can lock the shutter in the open position, and it also gets rid of any blur from the movement of my hands.」

％Ｂ
「What happens if something in the shot moves while the shutter's open?」
Natsuki
「You'll see it in the photo as a trail. Shooting stars should show up as a pretty line of light.」

Natsuki
「Though of course that also means those trails get warped if the camera shakes while the shutter's open.」

Natsuki
「But Sora requested photos of constellations for this, so we don't want to see any trails of the stars moving. It'd be hard to see them as constellations that way.」


Natsuki
「So the remote shutter release is more going to be for getting rid of hand movements.」
Natsuki
「The main issue is the exposure duration. Starlight's weak, so I'll have to use a long exposure time when I'm taking a photo on film. But the longer the exposure, the more the stars will move across the sky.」


Natsuki
「If I want to take good photos of constellations, I'll need to find an exposure time that's just right, so the stars show up clearly and there aren't any trails.」


％Ｂ
「Huh... I didn't know it was so much trouble taking photos of stars. So about how long are you going to keep the shutter open, then?」


Natsuki
「To be honest, I don't know. This is my first time taking photos of stars, so it'll be completely trial and error.」


Natsuki
「I'll just have to take a few photos with different exposure times, and start from there.」
％Ｂ
「Got it.」
Natsuki
「And one more thing. The problem with film is that I won't be able to see how the photos came out right away.」

I see...
She can't look at the photos on the spot like with a digital camera, so if she messes up, we'll have to come back to try again another day...

all
％Ｂ
「This might be harder than I thought...」
We might have to come here for test shots for a few days.
I hope we can get them to come out nicely as soon as possible...
