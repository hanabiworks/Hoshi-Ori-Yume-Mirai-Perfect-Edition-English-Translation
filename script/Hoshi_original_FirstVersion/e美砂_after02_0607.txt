「I'm off to Marinpia, then!」
Firm Staff B
「...He's been going on site a lot lately.」
Shouji
「Oh, maybe it's because of the client? That Okihara-san who's curating there's really pretty.」

％Ｂ
「It's because it's our firm's policy to treat the client like family, and make frequent appearances on site.」

Shouji
「Mhm, mhm. Yep, I'd wanna treat Okihara-san like family too...」

％Ｂ
「Uh... I'll be going then.」
Firm Staff B
「Yes, have a productive time.」
I've recently been making sure to go to Marinpia as often as possible when I have downtime at work.

I've been teased that it's because of Misa, and of course, I can't really refute that.

But it's not just to see her.
The two of us are working together to give form to something.\n\r
It's a wonderful sensation that gets me feeling like we're back in high school again.
％Ｂ
「Now then... Let's go.」
The aquarium's in the middle of renovations at the moment.
Azuma-san's in charge of the design, using the aquarium side's plans as a base.

These renovations are going to give birth to a more complete Marinpia.\n\r

And I want to contribute to that.
％Ｂ
「Thank you very much, everyone!」
I greet the contractors on site and hand out plastic bottles of drinks to them.

％Ｂ
「Thank you very much! Great work! Thank you very much!」
After I make the rounds with the contractors, it's time to greet the Marinpia staff.

％Ｂ
「Thank you for your hard work! I'm ％Ａ, from the Azuma Architectural Firm!」
Male Staff
「Hey there, Hino-kun. Thanks for always coming by.」
Male Staff
「Hey there. Thanks for coming all the time.」
Female Staff
「It's a lot of work to come every day, isn't it? You don't need to force yourself, you know.」
％Ｂ
「Oh no, it's fine. I can't help but get curious about what's happening over here when I'm at the firm... Here, I brought these for you all to drink too.」


Male Staff
「You're always a big help. Thank you.」
Female Staff
「We have some snacks, so you can enjoy yourself here.」
％Ｂ
「Thank you very much!」
I've become acquainted with not only the contractors, but also with the Marinpia staff.

According to Misa, they apparently really appreciate the passionate young man from the architectural firm.

％Ｂ
「Have there been any issues with the renovations? Please let me know if there are any requests you have.」

Male Staff
「Well speaking of, there's been a little something...」
Female Staff
「Oh, that's right. It's such a minor thing that we weren't sure if we should mention it, but...」

％Ｂ
「Oh no, it's my job to listen to every thought you have. What is it?」

I pull out a notepad and get ready.
There are times when minor statements can help us find major problems.

I can't let even the smallest details escape my notice.
Misa
「Hello, Hino-san. I wasn't aware you were here.」

Misa
「Hello. I wasn't aware you were here.」

％Ｂ
「Hello there. Thank you for your hard work, Okihara-san.」
％Ｂ
「I was just asking the other staff for their thoughts. Please let me know if you have anything to discuss as well, Okihara-san. I would be glad to be of assistance.」


Misa
「I see, I see. Then... may I ask you for some advice?」

％Ｂ
「Of course. Feel free.」
I jot down the statements from the other staff members, and sit down at a desk with Misa.

Misa
「Oh, would you like some tea? I will pour you some!」

％Ｂ
「I'll take you up on the offer, then.」
all
And so I'm having tea in the aquarium office.
Misa
「Ufufu... Here, then.」
％Ｂ
「Thank you very much, Okihara-san.」
I call her "Okihara-san" when the other staff are around.
It's different from "Senpai," but the formality's just another thing that makes me feel like we've gone back to when we were in high school.

Misa
「This is actually a matter that pertains to the overall progression of the work...」
％Ｂ
「I've heard that it seems to be progressing steadily, but is there an issue?」
Misa
「Yes, just one thing...」
Misa
「There is something that has yet to be decided regarding the display. The staff are currently considering options, but we just cannot seem to decide.」


％Ｂ
「I see, that's...」
Misa
「Could I have you look at this?」
She unfolds Azuma-san's renovation blueprints out on the desk.
Misa
「The aquarium's path will start first with "Shionagi's sea," then move to "the southern seas," and then proceed to the large-scale tank of the "Pacific Ocean."」


％Ｂ
「Yes, I see.」
Misa
「And after that will be the "dolphin stadium," which will proceed into the "sea of marine mammals."」

Misa
「This will result in a southern progression across the oceans, starting from Shionagi and ending at the south pole.」

Misa
「The issue lies with the display for the small hallway between the "Pacific Ocean" and the "dolphin stadium." We have yet to decide what will be displayed here...」


％Ｂ
「For the hallway... I see.」
Misa
「We do have some ideas. Such as the "deep sea," which usually cannot be witnessed, or a "touch pool" where one can directly come into contact with beach organisms.」


Misa
「But both of those are displays one can find in many other aquariums.」

Misa
「We would like it to be a display that one can only find at Marinpia Shionagi, that can provide yet-unheard-of surprises and wonder.」

％Ｂ
「I see. That is indeed quite the difficult problem. But it's definitely worth thinking about.」

Misa
「We are currently considering other options as well, but we just can't seem to decide... and so I would like to ask the opinion of someone who is not one of our staff.」

％Ｂ
「I understand. I would love to help, if that would be okay with you.」

Misa
「Are you free after this?」
％Ｂ
「Well, I'm personally free... but if I recall, isn't there an inspection of some sort today? I wouldn't want to stay here and get in their way...」


Misa
「Y-Yes, there is. And so...」

She glances around a bit and lowers her voice.
Misa
「...Would it be okay if we discussed this at your residence?」
She leans toward me a bit and whispers.
％Ｂ
「Hm... That may end up going quite late. Perhaps even past midnight...」

Misa
「I would be very grateful if I could stay the night in that case...」

Misa
「Since... we have the day off for once tomorrow...」
％Ｂ
「Of course that's okay. Oh, are you already prepared for that?」

Misa
「Y-Yes, I am. This morning, I...」

Female Staff
「I'm sorry to interrupt, but Okihara-san, can I speak with you?」
Misa
「Oh, yes. Then, as we have discussed.」

％Ｂ
「I understand.」
all
She exchanges a look with me, and follows the staff member out the door.
She said she'd be staying over.
And she specifically mentioned that we're off of work tomorrow...
％Ｂ
（...I should clean up.）
I can't help but be expectant.
％Ｂ
「Phew... I think I'm done.」
I'm cleaning up my apartment a bit.
Misa may come over pretty often, but it's still just me living here alone.
It gets pretty sloppy-looking if I get lazy.
And it gets even worse if I'm busy.
I feel like having Misa stay the night like this every now and then gets me to clean up my act in general.

％Ｂ
「Oh, she's here. Comiiing.」
Misa
「Good evening! I apologize for being late!」
Misa pants out a greeting after I open the door.
Misa
「The inspection went on for longer than I... I'm so sorry for making you wait.」

％Ｂ
「It's fine, that just happens at around this point in renovations. Anyway, come on in.」

Misa
「Yes, I apologize for the intrusion～ Mmh... hahhh...」

％Ｂ
「What are you breathing in deep for?」
Misa
「I was just thinking that this calms me down. I was slightly tense today, but now I'm all squishy.」

％Ｂ
「Hahaha, you gotta pull yourself together.」
Misa
「I feel like a squid.」
She slumps onto me on purpose.
I catch her securely.
％Ｂ
「I'm gonna make some dinner, so wait a bit.」
Misa
「Oh, would it be okay if I helped!?」
She immediately sits up straight.
％Ｂ
「...Aren't you tired?」
Misa
「I'm completely fine! I'm always being spoiled by you, so I was thinking I would like to repay the favor sometimes...」


％Ｂ
「Really... Could you help, then? I was thinking of making ground beef steak.」

Misa
「I'll do the knead-knead! And the grilling!」

She immediately starts rolling up her sleeves. She's raring to go.
Though it's not like she can actually roll up her suit sleeves that much.
％Ｂ
「Could you, then?」
Misa
「Yes! Please, allow me!」
all
Misa
「Cheers～」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, cheers.」
I had some cheap red wine left over, so we mixed it with some club soda for tonight's drink.
We have properly grilled ground beef steak before us.
It looks delicious, with a ketchup sauce poured on top.
％Ｂ
「Let's eat. Ohhh... This is great!」

Misa
「I'll also eat! ...Hamh, hamh... You're right! It came out delicious!」

％Ｂ
「It's super juicy. Is this seriously that meat that I just had in the fridge? That was clearance stuff...」


Misa
「The trick is apparently to use low heat with the lid on to steam it. I'm glad my research paid off.」

I remember she was reading something off her phone intently before we started cooking.
I'm happy she put so much effort into it.
Misa
「Delicious meat and delicious wine. And the person I love right in front of me. This is a very wonderful dinner!」
％Ｂ
「I should be the one saying that. This is an amazing dinner.」

Misa
「Ufufufu... If you would like... may I make tomorrow's breakfast too?」


％Ｂ
「Really? You can use anything you want from the fridge, then.」

Misa
「Yes, then I will do my best!」
I'm so lucky to be able to eat food this good twice in a row.

Misa
「Oh, yes. May I ask you something as we eat?」
％Ｂ
「Sure.」
Misa
「It's about the hallway display that I mentioned earlier today. There actually is an idea that I have....」

％Ｂ
「How about I take a guess?」
Misa
「Wha...?」
％Ｂ
「Is it a jellyfish display?」
Misa
「H-How did you know!?」
％Ｂ
「And I bet the display title's gonna be the "sea of jellies"!」
Misa
「That's exactly correct too! Incredible! That's incredible!」

Misa
「It must be because we've known each other for so many years. Perhaps it's some form of telepathy that the two of us share.」

％Ｂ
「Might be.」
It was pretty easy, to be honest...
Misa
「There is going to be a meeting on the subject of that hallway display. Each of us is supposed to present our proposed ideas...」


％Ｂ
「And so you're thinking of proposing a jellyfish display.」
Misa
「Yes. But to tell you the truth, I'm not very confident...」
％Ｂ
「That doesn't sound like the ex-president of the naturalist club that I know. People used to say they thought of you when they thought of jellyfish, and vice versa.」

％Ｂ
「So why aren't you confident?」
Misa
「I've actually already mentioned the idea of a jellyfish display once to the other staff. But it wasn't particularly well received...」


％Ｂ
「How was it received exactly?」
Misa
「Jellyfish displays are popular among women... but the opinion at the time was that it would be a relatively minor display, and thus would not require an entire hallway's worth of space.」


％Ｂ
「I see... Oh yeah, didn't Marinpia already use to have a jellyfish exhibit?」

Misa
「Yes. That jellyfish display was located in one of the passageways near the large tank.」

％Ｂ
「Oh yeah... Right, it was. I guess it wasn't an entire hallway's display back then either.」

Misa
「Similar displays are apparently used as transition pieces between other larger displays at other aquariums.」

％Ｂ
「I see...」
％Ｂ
「But doesn't that mean that it'd be something pretty new if Marinpia displayed them in a different way?」

Misa
「Yes... That is also my intention with the proposal. The elegance of jellyfish is soothing in a way that is difficult for other displays to compare to. It would be nice if we could create that, but...」


％Ｂ
「But you'll need to put together a presentation to convince the other staff members for that.」

Misa
「...Yes, I will.」
％Ｂ
「Listen here, Misa. When it comes to presentations, it's game over if the person giving the presentation loses faith.」

...I say it as if I know exactly what I'm talking about.
But that's the genuine truth that I've learned at Azuma-san's firm.
％Ｂ
「You need to be confident and self-assured with your proposal. Bluff if you need to! You need to have that kinda mindset.」


Misa
「Yes! ...I will take that to heart.」
％Ｂ
「I'll help you with practicing and making materials for the presentation. Let's work together to make your idea into reality.」

Misa
「Thank you very much! I will do my best!」
all
I slowly sip at the last of the wine-soda mix.
I can hear the sound of dishes being washed from the kitchen.
Misa's cheerily washing plates.
I told her I could at least wash the dishes, but she apparently wants to do everything today.\n\r

And so I ended up letting her do it.
I glance at the time.
It's almost midnight.
Misa
「Hahh, I'm done～」
She returns, wiping her hands with a towel.
％Ｂ
「Thanks. Wanna drink a little more?」
I hold out the wine-soda mix.
Misa
「I'd love to... Nkh...」
％Ｂ
「You can drink all of it.」
Misa
「Nkh, nkh... Pfah. Mmfufu... Drinking after a job well done... is exceptional!」

She drinks down the little there was left.
She smiles at me, a bit red in the face.
％Ｂ
「Thanks, Misa. That was really delicious.」

Misa
「Oh no, it was nothing at all.」
Misa
「Likewise for me... Thank you very much for always making me such good food. I can only hope I was able to repay the favor a little.」


％Ｂ
「What are you saying? The food today was amazing.」

Misa
「As they say, cooking is all about love. That was because I packed lots of love into it!」

％Ｂ
「I'm happy, Misa.」
Misa
「Oh...」
I casually move to hold her hand.
Misa
「I apologize... I believe my hands may be cold at the moment.」

％Ｂ
「Cold? ...Whoa, yeah, you're right.」
Her hands are pretty cold.
I wrap my hands around them and squeeze tight.
Misa
「I only just finished washing the dishes, so they're slightly cold.」

％Ｂ
「You could've used hot water.」
Misa
「I couldn't help but feel guilty if I had...」
％Ｂ
「You know, you're weirdly frugal sometimes.」
Misa
「A-Am I? But... it's important to be aware of such things.」


Misa
「I've always been entirely reliant on my mother for food too... but I've been helping her when I'm off recently. The results of that experience may have contributed to the ground beef steak today.」


％Ｂ
「Really now...」
Misa
「Yes, because... in the future...」
％Ｂ
「...Oh...」
We look at each other.
Misa
「Oh, u-umm... Ufufufu...」
She flushes in embarrassment and looks down.
Misa
「B-Because I am an adult now! I need to be able to take care of myself...」

％Ｂ
「Y-Yeah... That's true.」
Misa
「Y-Yes, it is!」
We smile at each other to smooth over the moment.
But I think we're both feeling the same way.
Misa
「Oh... My hands are starting to get warmer.」
％Ｂ
「I guess my body heat's spreading to you?」
Misa
「Yes, I can feel your warmth... It's... very comfortable.」

Misa
「Oh, but... Ryousuke-san, your hands are going to get cold in exchange...」
Misa
「Oh, but... your hands are going to get cold in exchange...」
％Ｂ
「Can't do anything about equivalent exchange.」
Misa
「No, we must both get warm together! Rub rub rub...」

％Ｂ
「Oh, that's pretty nice. Rub rub rub...」
We both rub our hands together.
The slight warmth we generate is kinda nice.
We playfully continue to rub our hands together.
％Ｂ
「Though it's not like this'll warm us up much.」
Misa
「It isn't very energy efficient, is it?」
％Ｂ
「...Hm, then... Wanna take a bath or something?」
Misa
「Oh... Y-Yes... That's a good idea.」
We're squeezing each other's hands tight.
Misa
「Umm...」
％Ｂ
「Hm?」
Misa
「May I... ask something selfish of you?」
％Ｂ
「Sure, anything you want.」
Misa
「Then... I would like you to wash my hair.」
％Ｂ
「What, that's all? Of course I can. Though all I've got is my usual shampoo... The cheapest stuff I could find at the convenience store.」


Misa
「That's what I would like. It may smell different from my usual shampoo... but it would really make me feel that I've come to stay the night.」


Misa
「Having you wash it carefully... would make me feel very dreamy.」
％Ｂ
「All right... Wanna take that bath, then?」
Misa
「Yes... Please treat me well... okay?」
all
I gently loosen her hair band.
Her long hair flutters out of its bundle.
She's smiling in that innocent way just like she did back in high school...
％Ｂ
「You're so cute, Misa.」
Misa
「Mmh... chu...」
And I just can't stop myself from kissing her again.
all
Misa
「Ahhh～ ...That was heaven～」
She seems refreshed.
I'm drying her hair after our bath.
She's leaning against me, wearing just a towel.
Seeing her so comfortable is so precious.
％Ｂ
「Your hair's so pretty.」
Misa
「Ufufu... I'm happy. It makes me glad I let it grow out... every time you compliment it.」

％Ｂ
「Gotta make sure I don't damage it. First, I'll dry your scalp...」

Misa
「You're very good! Like a real professional!」
I've become pretty proficient at drying her hair, since I do this pretty often.
Once her scalp's dry enough, I start evenly applying the hair dryer from her roots to the ends of her hair.

And lastly...
％Ｂ
「I'm gonna use cold air now.」
Misa
「O-Okay... Ahhh～ It's nice and cool～」

Misa
「Hauh, I'm drooling...」
％Ｂ
「That always seems to happen.」
Misa
「I can't help iiit... I love it when the hot air becomes cold... It feels so good...」


Misa apparently really likes this moment.
I don't really understand it myself.
But I guess it must feel incredible when your hair's this long.
％Ｂ
「All right, done!」
Misa
「Ahh, you've dried it perfectly. I feel like I've become a proper young lady...」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, but you already actually are one... All right, want me to do some skin care too?」

Misa
「It's like at a beauty salon! I would love that!」

％Ｂ
「Then let's start with lotion...」
I reach out toward the overnight skin care set that Misa had taken out.

Misa
「P-Please slap!」
％Ｂ
「Like this?」
Slap slap slap slap...!
Misa
「A-Auh～」
％Ｂ
「A-Are you all right?」
Misa
「Y-Yes...! Doing this apparently gets the lotion to seep deep into the skin...」

Slap slap slap slap...!
Misa
「As a woman, I would like to preserve the cute me for my boyfriend～」

Slap slap slap slap...!!!
Misa
「A-Aahhhh～」
％Ｂ
「A-Are you sure this is what we need to do?」
Misa
「Y-Yesss... I'm sure the lotion has seeped in lots after so much slap-slap...」

％Ｂ
「The milk lotion next, then.」
I slather the white liquid onto her skin.
Misa
「Hauh.... It's very cold on my hot skin...」
％Ｂ
「It's a lot of work being a woman... Guys don't have to deal with this at all.」

％Ｂ
「Thanks for always being so pretty for me.」
Misa
「...Hahhh...」
Misa
「This is nothing, since you show me lots of love for it...」

％Ｂ
「Oh...」
She's not wearing any makeup at all right now...
But her smile is incredibly pretty.
Misa
「U-Ufufufufu... Sh-Shall I... put on... some pajamas now?」

％Ｂ
「S-Sure. You can use mine.」
Misa
「Then some underwear first... O-Oh?」

％Ｂ
「What's wrong?」
Misa
「H-How silly of me... It appears I forgot my underwear at home...」

％Ｂ
「What!? Did you really?」
Misa
「Y-Yes. I prepared them this morning, but it seems I didn't put them in my bag...」

％Ｂ
「Really... What should we do? Want me to go buy you some at the convenience store?」
Misa
「But I wouldn't want to trouble you that way...」
％Ｂ
「Oh, I know. Don't you have a pair here? You know, from before...」

Misa
「Those are the slightly perverted ones we bought online.」
％Ｂ
「Y-Yeah... Not okay?」
Misa
「...It isn't... not okay...」
She's rubbing her body.
Misa
「You did make... my body clean after all...」
She smiles bashfully.
e美砂_9009エッチシーン9
Misa and I go to sleep.
Feeling each other's warmth in our arms is wonderfully comfortable.
_ef_ryusen03
_ef_ryusen04
...
......
.........
Is this... a dream?
Misa and I are holding each other tight as we move through the ocean.
Drifting through the water, rocked by the gentle waves...
Is this Shionagi's sea...?
Or is it Okinawa...?
I guess it doesn't matter...
Still, this is really comfortable.
I feel like I've felt this kind of comfort before, a long time ago... Where was that again...?

Drifting, drifting...
Oh, right... It was inside my mother's belly...
It feels the same way as back when I was enveloped in amniotic fluid...
...Wait, what?
How do I even remember something like that?
There's no way...
So I guess this has to be a dream after all...
