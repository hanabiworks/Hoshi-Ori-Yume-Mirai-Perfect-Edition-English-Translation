「Whew... Ahh, what a great bath...」
Sora
「...You're an old man.」
％Ｂ
「I'm fine being an old maaan... It feels good... Whew...」


Sora
「...You're okay with it now.」
％Ｂ
「Ahh... I haven't gotten to relax like this in a while...」
I completed the blueprint for the Shionagi Cultural Hall last month.

I'm not completely uninvolved anymore, but things should be substantially easier for me since Azuma-san's firm is going to do the rest.


And there's also Sora's new planetarium show that's supposed to be her promotion test.
Her show was accepted with much acclaim.
Now that the load on both of our shoulders has been lessened a little, we've come back to these hot springs where we can see the stars that we came to last year.

％Ｂ
「...Speaking of, today's Labor Thanksgiving Day. It's the perfect holiday for coming to get rid of the fatigue from working.」

Sora
「...No talking about work today.」
％Ｂ
「I like the sound of that. All right, then let's not talk about work until we go back home tomorrow.」

Sora
「...*nod*」
We look up at the night sky.
The Southern Cross shines brightly in the winter sky.
％Ｂ
「...By the way, the Sou─..gh...」
Wait, that was close! We're gonna end up talking about Sora's work if we talk about the stars.

Sora
「...What's wrong?」
％Ｂ
「No, nothing. Don't worry about it.」
Sora
「...Okay. By the way, is Shuu's house almost done?」
Oh... She just up and said it.
Sora gasps when she realizes what she just said.

Sora
「...It's okay because we're talking about a friend...」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, it's about a friend... The exterior's done already, and they're working on the interior now. It'll probably be finished by next month.」


Sora
「...Will you be able to relax more once it's done?」
％Ｂ
「...No, 'cause I've got the competition for the science museum next year. I can't relax too much.」

％Ｂ
「I have to grant your first ever "selfish" request.」
Sora
「...*nod* Thank you.」
Sora
「...You helped me again for the new planetarium show. It's my turn next. I'll help you, Ryou.」

Sora
「...You helped me again for the new planetarium show. It's my turn next. I'll help you.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, you'll really come in handy. I'm expecting great things.」
Sora
「So I have a suggestion.」
％Ｂ
「Hm?」
Sora
「...What about making the building star-shaped?」
％Ｂ
「Uh... Uhh... Uhhhhhh... W-Well, I guess I can try drawing up a rough draft later. We'll discuss it more once I do that.」


Sora
「...*nod*」
Sora
「...Oh... The stars are raining down.」
％Ｂ
「Huh? You see shooting stars?」
Sora
「...*shake shake*」
I look blankly at Sora, and then a speck of snow flutters down and melts into the hot spring.

％Ｂ
「Oh... Snow.」
％Ｂ
「Ohh... It's really starting to come down.」
Sora
「...I've never taken a bath in the snow before. It's like the stars are raining down.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah... It's a nice mood.」
Powdery snow flutters down from the starry sky above.
We enjoy the beautiful sight for a while as we relax in the bath.
