And so―
Sora and I left Japan to have our wedding ceremony overseas.
The ocean's a perfect, clear blue.
The skies are high and wide open.
The clouds floating above look whiter and somehow softer than any I've ever seen in Japan.
The foreign breeze, pregnant with the fragrance of a different culture, gently blows through our hair.

As if the sun were celebrating all things on this Earth...
No. Not all things. Not right now.
It shines down onto Earth to celebrate us.
But the joy in my heart right now shines brighter still.

The world's most beautiful bride looks right into my eyes and smiles in her pure-white dress.

Getting to hold this bashful, happy smile here in my arms is my happiness.

％Ｂ
「Sora. You're beautiful.」
Sora
「...Hearing you say that so seriously makes me blush.」
％Ｂ
「I can't help it if it's true.」
Sora
「...Ryou... You look really handsome too.」
Sora
「...You... look really handsome too.」
％Ｂ
「...Hearing you say that with a serious face is gonna make me blush.」
Sora
「It's true, so I can't help it.」
We smile at each other.
％Ｂ
「Still though, I didn't think our vows would all be in English.」
Sora
「...We're overseas, so of course they were.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, but I have no idea what I said.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「No matter what happens in the future, I'll live out the rest of my life together with you, Sora. I vow to love you always.」

Sora
「...I vow to do so too.」
Sora
「I think lots will happen in the future.」
Sora
「I'm sure it won't all be fun. Painful things will happen too. Sometimes we'll want to cry. I think we'll fight too. We'll get discouraged, lonely, and sad...」


Sora
「But I'll share all of that with you.」
Sora
「My love for you will never change, just like the unchanging light of the stars above.」

Sora
「This love... is yours and yours alone, for eternity.」
％Ｂ
「...Sora.」
Sora
「Thank you for my happiness.」
We kiss softly.
Not just as lovers, but as two people who will live out their lives together as husband and wife.
After the ceremony, the two of us head to our true destination.
The wedding ceremony was important for us, but our hearts are dancing in anticipation even more for this.

That's right...
A world-renowned stargazing spot─
％Ｂ
「...」
Sora
「...!?」
I lose the ability to speak at the sight before me.
Even Sora falls silent.
The light before us is just too grand... too intense, too overwhelming.
We don't know how to describe it with words.
We simply stand there, our hearts stolen away by the sight.
％Ｂ
「So this... is a true starry sky...」
Sora
「...*nod*」
Unaffected by the air conditions, undisturbed by man-made light...
This must have been the world as it was before humankind obtained light.

The stars before us are as they were meant to be...
％Ｂ
「Look... The Milky Way looks like an actual river.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「I feel like I get why Orihime and Hikoboshi can only meet once a year... It'd be tough to cross that river.」

Sora
「...*nod*」
It's the natural light of the stars. It's completely different from the artificial light from a planetarium.
I never would've believed that there were so many stars shining above us if I hadn't come somewhere like this.

％Ｂ
「...People say "a sky full of stars" a lot, but this must be what they really mean.」

Sora
「...A true "sky full of stars"...」
All of the stars twinkle in the sky.
Beautiful, shimmering constellations smile upon us from ancient reaches of space amidst the inky blackness.

We're holding hands without even realizing.
％Ｂ
「Crap... I think I might cry...」
Sora
「...*nod*」
Sora
「...I'm already crying.」
I look to see that she really is.
Sora's hand squeezes mine hard.
I squeeze back in response.
And then I look back up at the sky.
Sora
「...Thank you for bringing me here...」
％Ｂ
「Yeah... I wanted to come here someday too.」
Sora
「...Thank you for finding me among so many other stars.」
Sora
「...Thank you... for falling in love with only me.」
Sora
「Thank you... for loving me this much.」
