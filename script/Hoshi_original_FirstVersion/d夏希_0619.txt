「Mmm... All right, let's get going.」
Rikka
「...Are you doing committee work again today?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. We have to prepare for the Tanabata Festival.」
％Ｂ
「It's a lot of work, 'cause I have to help with the naturalist club and the astronomy club.」

Rikka
「...It seems like you're having fun, though.」
％Ｂ
「Uh... Really?」
Rikka
「Because you just seem so energetic. It might be a lot of work, but to me it also looks like you're having the time of your life.」

％Ｂ
「Mmm... Yeah, some parts are fun. It's pretty exciting doing something together with others.」

Rikka
「Hmm...」
％Ｂ
「Catching those fish and stuff on Saturday was fun, wasn't it?」
Rikka
「What...? Yes, it was. That was fun too.」
％Ｂ
「Hey, you sure you don't wanna join the committee with us?」
％Ｂ
「Segawa and Yukimura both said themselves that they wanted to help out.」

Rikka
「What? ...Segawa-san and Yukimura-san did?」
％Ｂ
「That's right. They―」
Natsuki
「Hey, I've got somewhere I wanna go before we go to the committee office. Could you come with?」

Rikka
「Oh... Segawa-san...」
％Ｂ
「...」
Natsuki
「Hurry it up. You are still my assistant, you know.」
Rikka
「Wha... Assistant...?」
Natsuki
「
Hino 
This guy 
has to help me with my grad-alb committee work in exchange for me helping out with the event committee. I guess you could call it a fair trade.」


Rikka
「...I see... A fair trade... Hmm.」
all
％Ｂ
「Uhh... Let's get going, then.」
％Ｂ
「Later... Narusawa... Let me know if you ever feel up to it...」
Rikka
「...」
％Ｂ
「Hey, so where do you wanna go?」
Natsuki
「That's something for you to look forward to～」
Something to look forward to...?
Natsuki
「It has to be you.」
It has to be me?
Wh-What's up with that meaningful-sounding explanation...!?
％Ｂ
「Hey, isn't this―」
Natsuki
「Shhh! We're behind the old school building...」
What the heck did Segawa bring me here for? Hardly anyone ever comes here...

She said it was something to look forward to, and that it had to be me...
Uh... I'm starting to get kinda nervous...
Natsuki
「...Look over there... Right there, under the roof.」
all
％Ｂ
「Under the roof... Oh!」
Natsuki
「Shhh! Be quiet...!」
％Ｂ
「M-My bad...」
all
Segawa's pointing to a sparrow nest under the roof of the old school building.
I can see several chicks peeking out from inside, chirping with their mouths open for food.

％Ｂ
「Does that nest belong to the sparrow I took a picture of the other day...?」
Natsuki
「Probably.」
％Ｂ
「Wait a second, did we come here to get a shot of those chicks?」
Natsuki
「What other reason is there?」
％Ｂ
「...Yeah. Right.」
What the heck was I getting so excited for...?
％Ｂ
「But that nest's up pretty high. Isn't it gonna be kinda rough to get a shot of it from here?」

Natsuki
「Why do you think I brought you with me?」
％Ｂ
「...You want me to take the photo for you?」
Natsuki
「Do you want to be on your hands or knees, or do you want me on your shoulders?」
Ah, I see... So I'm a platform.
％Ｂ
「I'm kinda scared of you now that I know you consider those two options to be on the same tier.」
all
I sigh, and get on my knees.
Natsuki
「What? You're going to go on your hands and knees?」
％Ｂ
「The other one!」
Natsuki
「Riiight. Thank god. I don't know what I would've done if you had picked the first one.」

％Ｂ
「Don't include it in the options then...」
％Ｂ
「And you sure you wanna sit on a guy's shoulders, as a girl...?」

Natsuki
「I wouldn't be fine with just anyone. I just figured I might be fine with it if it was you.」

％Ｂ
「...What?」
Wait a second... What's that―
all
Natsuki
「There we go!」
I'm trying to think it over when two pale, soft, smooth, and faintly warm things sandwich my face.

Segawa's thighs―
Natsuki
「Okay, you can stand up.」
％Ｂ
「R-Right... Hang on tight...」
％Ｂ
「H-How's this?」
Natsuki
「Oh, pretty good. I think I'll be able to get a good shot this way. Could you get a little closer?」

％Ｂ
「S-Sure...」
I move toward the nest carefully.
Natsuki
「Stop here for now.」
％Ｂ
「...」
...Actually, what the heck's going on right now?
Why do I have a the thighs of a girl my age sandwiching my face?
It feels warm... or more like hot...
It smells kinda nice, and my heart's beating out of my chest...
Natsuki
「Hey... Do you know how long sparrows live for?」
She asks as she presses the shutter button.
％Ｂ
「Hm? They're birds, so like five or six years?」
Natsuki
「It's apparently a year and a half on average.」
％Ｂ
「Wha... Their lifespans are that short?」
Natsuki
「On average, yeah. They're migratory birds, right? So apparently about half of them die in the middle of migration.」

％Ｂ
「Oh, really... Yeah, I forgot these guys migrate.」
Natsuki
「It'd be amazing if the one that made this nest was one that hatched here last year, and came back to give birth to new life.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah... It'd be like something out of a story.」
％Ｂ
「Huh? They're crying louder now.」
Natsuki
「Shhh! Quiet!」
Segawa places her finger against my lips.
％Ｂ
「Ngh...??」
Natsuki
「...I think the parent's come back. This is a great photo op...」
％Ｂ
「...」
I nod silently.
Segawa pulls her finger away from my mouth and brings her camera up to her face.
Natsuki
「Could you get just a little closer? Slowly, quietly...」
％Ｂ
「Hm...」
I shuffle closer to the nest.
Natsuki
「...Okay... Stop... This is good...」
A bird with a small bug in its beak returns to the nest after a bit.
The chicks start chirping for food even louder.
I can hear the clicking of a shutter raining down on me from above.
I bet Segawa's focused entirely on that sparrow and its chicks right now.
As for me, I'm thinking about Segawa's thighs right next to my face─
But even more than that, I'm thinking about how she just touched my lips.
Natsuki
「Mhm, I think that's good. You can let me down now.」
％Ｂ
「...」
Natsuki
「Heeey
? Hino～
? 
Do my thighs really feel that nice?」
％Ｂ
「What!? Oh, uh, I'll let you down.」
Natsuki
「Ahahah, I'm kidding. Slowly, okay?」
％Ｂ
「R-Right...」
I hold in my agitation and slowly bend my knees.
I check to see that Segawa's feet are on the ground, and then pull my head out from between her thighs―
％Ｂ
「Whoah...!?」
My head catches on her skirt as I'm about to pull away.
I look upward on reflex to swipe the skirt off of myself, and I see―

％Ｂ
「Hgh...!?」
Pink...!
％Ｂ
「...」
I have to hand it to myself...
For not making any sound... Just burning the sight of Segawa's pink panties right there before my eyes into my mind...!

Natsuki
「Hm...?」
I've recomposed myself by the time Segawa turns around.
Nothing happened just now...
I didn't see anything...
Natsuki
「...Let's head to where the others are now.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah... Let's do that.」
all
％Ｂ
「Heeey...」
Natsuki
「Looks like you guys are working hard.」
Misa
「Yes, likewise to you.」
all
Segawa and I have come to the old school building's chemistry classroom.
She was acting completely normal on the way here.
It doesn't look like she noticed I saw her underwear.
I guess she didn't realize at all back when we were playing soccer either.\n \n\r
And it's Segawa, so even if she did find out, she'd probably just go, "Oh, you saw? Ahahah," and that'd be the end of that.

all
％Ｂ
「I guess I didn't need to be so nervous...」
Natsuki
「Huh? What are you doing, Misa-san?」
％Ｂ
「Hm...?」
Senpai's wiping up a puddle of water off the floor.
Misa
「I was changing out the tank water with Shinozaki-san before the two of you arrived, but she unfortunately spilled some water after a slip of the hand...」


％Ｂ
「Wha... Did she break a water tank?」
Misa
「Oh no, the tanks are fine. It is just that she spilled quite a lot of water on herself, so I had her go to the infirmary to borrow a towel, as we have none here...」


％Ｂ
「Oh, I guess there isn't anything like that here, now that you mention it. I'll ask Shuuichi to have some brought here.」

all
Marika
「I'm baaack...」
％Ｂ
「Oh, Shinozaki.」
Misa
「Are you all right?」
Marika
「I aaam... I was able to borrow a hair dryer from the infirmary doctor, so I was able to dry myself off. Though I was told to have my clothes washed properly afterward...」


Misa
「I also believe that would be good, as it was seawater.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, you can still catch a cold in the summer if you get wet. So it was just your upper body that got wet? I can go buy a towel or something for you if you want.」


Natsuki
「You really had it rough, didn't you?」
Marika
「I got soaked all the way down to my underwear...」
％Ｂ
「Uh... Down to your underwear...?」
all
Natsuki
「...」
Segawa and I look at each other in unison.
Her face goes bright red as soon as our gazes meet, and she immediately looks away.

Natsuki
「Uh... I'm... going to go to the bathroom real quick...」
She walks away a little awkwardly.
all
％Ｂ
「...」
Judging by her reaction just now...
...I guess she did notice that I saw her underwear after all...
Misa
「
Ryousuke-san...? 
Is something the matter...? 
Your face is red.」
％Ｂ
「...No... I'm fine...」
all
What do I do...
I don't really know if I'll be able to look Segawa in the eye for the rest of the day...
