I get to work a little earlier than usual, get my morning routine out of the way, and take a look at the newspaper.

I don't really read the newspaper that much, since I get most of my news from the internet.\n\r

But there should be something of interest to me in today's paper.
％Ｂ
「Oh... Yep, there it is.」
『Marinpia Shionagi draws breath again. The city's residents clamor for it to be reopened.』

An article about how the municipal legislative assembly's decided to reopen Marinpia Shionagi.

Misa and I already know about this, of course, since Arita-san already told us about the results.

But seeing it written out as an article in the paper really brings it home for me.

％Ｂ
「Now let's see...」
There's an interview with Arita-san included in the article, as a representative for the faction that proposed the reopening.

The interview consists of Arita-san talking about the significance in the city having an aquarium, and about its administration and restoration. 

She mentions that a great many residents of Shionagi called for the reopening of the aquarium, especially among the children.

％Ｂ
「"It is without question that the volunteer 'marine wildlife classroom' was also a significant factor in its reopening..."」

She isn't named, but Misa's work is definitely being alluded to in the article.

％Ｂ
「Gotta tell Misa about this right away.」
I grab my phone and type up a message.
【％Ｂ】「I read the morning #Npaper. It really #Nbrought home that #NMarinpia's gonna be #Nreopening for me. #NCongrats!」
【Misa】「Thank you very much. I #Nalso read it just now. #NMy parents are also #Nvery happy.」
【％Ｂ】「It looks like there #Nisn't a specific day #Nfor its reopening yet, #Nbut I'm looking forward #Nto it. We should #Ndefinitely go together #Nonce it opens!」
【Misa】「Of course we will.」
【Misa】「But I would like to be #Nthere once it reopens #Nnot as a guest, but as #None of the people #Nworking there.」
【％Ｂ】「Yeah, I know you're set #Non that. I'll always be #Non your side, and I'll #Nalways support you. You #Njust keep charging #Ntoward what you believe #Nin!」
【Misa】「Yes!」
【Misa】_st_0218
％Ｂ
「I guess she's really gonna quit her university job after all.」
Misa's gonna start moving toward a new goal once the aquarium's fully reopened.

％Ｂ
「And I guess I can't afford to just sit around and do nothing either.」
I have to be someone on even footing with Misa if I wanna propose to her.\n\r

Not the half qualified I am now. I have to be someone who can do real, professional work!
％Ｂ
「All right... Let's do this!」
Azuma
「Let's start our meeting, then.」
Azuma-san arrives, and our morning meeting begins.
This is when we all get updates on the current state of our projects, and get general announcements.
Shouji
「―And so we are currently awaiting an answer from the client.」

Azuma
「Hm. I see. All right, I'll leave the rest up to you for that, then.」

...I need to get to the point where Azuma-san can feel comfortable entrusting me with tasks too.

I feel like I'm overflowing with motivation.

The first priority is the Hokuou University competition.
If we end up being the ones to take responsibility for that, then I should definitely get at least a few more things to do.

I'll do as well as I can on the work I'm given, and gradually gain experience with more things―

Azuma
「No other announcements? I hope you all do good work today, then.」

％Ｂ
「Yes! I will!」
Azuma
「...You know, you're real chipper this morning. You're making me jealous over here.」

％Ｂ
「I'm sorry. I'm feeling a bit overmotivated today.」
Azuma
「...Is this about the Marinpia thing?」
％Ｂ
「Ah, so you do know, then?」
Azuma
「Yeah... I heard about it from Arita. She told me it's going to be reopened.」
％Ｂ
「Oh... You don't seem too happy about that. Even though the building that could be called your magnum opus is being reopened.」

Azuma
「Well, it's not like it reopening means it's going to get me more work.」

％Ｂ
「Speaking of which... I wonder what's going to happen on that front. Do you think they'll do some renovations?」

Azuma
「That's for the higher-ups to decide. There's no point in us talking about it.」

％Ｂ
「That's true...」
Azuma
「Right, speaking of remodeling, about that Hokuou University competition.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, yes.」
Azuma
「We apparently lost.」
％Ｂ
「Uh...」
He says it so casually that everyone in the room just stares dumbfoundedly at him.

％Ｂ
「Wait... We lost? ...But I thought they haven't put up the results yet...?」
Azuma
「There's been some internal discussion already. I heard it's going to be Sekitani this time around.」
Shouji
「That's...! So is it because he's an alumnus, then?」
Azuma
「No, his suggestion was pretty impressive. There's nothing we can do but accept the loss this time.」

Firm Staff B
「...That's unfortunate.」
Azuma
「Yeah... I apologize for letting you all down, after all your hard work.」

Azuma
「I'm thinking of hosting a "better luck next time" party tonight, so if any of you have the time, you should come. It'll be my treat.」


Shouji
「I'll be there!」
Firm Staff B
「I'll come too.」
Azuma
「How about you, Hino?」
Azuma
「How about you?」
％Ｂ
「...Wait, come on... Are we all just going to accept defeat, just like that?」

Azuma
「What else are we gonna do? We actually did lose.」
％Ｂ
「But... that's weird, isn't it? I can't believe our proposal lost...」
Azuma
「I already told you. Sekitani's work wasn't bad either.」
％Ｂ
「But it was just "not bad," wasn't it? I can't believe our suggestion lost... There's no way!」

Azuma
「Oh, come on... What do you think I am? I'm not some god of architecture, you know.」

Azuma
「You're right that I was pretty confident about our work this time around, but Sekitani's was just a bit more complete than ours.」

Azuma
「That's why I lost. There's always someone better. Don't play me up so much.」

％Ｂ
「But... aren't you bitter?」
Azuma
「It's not like this is my first time losing one of these. There's no point in getting bitter about each and every setback.」

Azuma
「Listen here. That project's done with now. You'll never become a good architect if you cling to stuff like that forever.」

Azuma
「Forget about the past, and turn your attention to the next project. That's what you need to do to be a good architect. Get it? Now get to work.」


％Ｂ
「Okay...」
all
But I still can't believe it.
I can't believe that such an amazing proposal would fail.
But it's like Azuma-san says. I can't let myself dwell on this.

I need to get over it, just like Azuma-san has.
...So I can become a genuine, professional architect!
Azuma
「What the fuck? Just how the hell is Sekitani better than me!?」

％Ｂ
「...」
Our "better luck next time" party is off to a rough start.
Azuma
「Competition my ass! That was rigged! They knew they were going to go with Sekitani right from the get-go! What a farce! God dammit!」


％Ｂ
「Uh, yes... Yeah, I know, right...」
It's completely different from what he was saying earlier today.
So he's bitter about it after all...
all
Shouji
「This is just how it goes around here.」
Firm Staff B
「He always gets like this when we lose competitions. Even though he's always so relaxed on the outside.」

Azuma
「You! You're bitter too, aren't you!?」
％Ｂ
「Uh... Oh, yes, I am.」
Azuma
「What are you sounding so relaxed for!? If you're bitter, then say it properly, dammit!」

％Ｂ
「I-I'm bitter! I'm crazy bitter too!」
Azuma
「That's right, say it! Drink up!」
％Ｂ
「Thank you very much!」
all
I drink at Azuma-san's prompting.
Shouji
「You shouldn't keep up with this for too long, all right?」
Firm Staff B
「You can go home whenever you want.」
％Ｂ
「No, I'll stay! Because I'm really bitter too!」
I finally got to make a significant contribution to a project, but nothing came of it.\n\r

Next time for sure...!
％Ｂ
「I'm going to channel this bitterness into my work! Please include me in the next project too! I'll definitely do good work and make you proud!」


Azuma
「The next project... What do you two think?」
Shouji
「Well, he wasn't perfect... but I think he still did a pretty good job. I think we can count on him.」


Firm Staff B
「Yes, I think it's about time for him to get some new work experience.」
％Ｂ
「You guys...」
Azuma
「That's true. I'll acknowledge you did good work this time around too. Fine! Then why don't you go ahead and do that!?」

％Ｂ
「Y-Yes! I'll do my best!」
Azuma
「All right, now drink up!」
％Ｂ
「Thank you very much!」
all
All right!
I've secured my next opportunity.
This time for sure, I'll get some actual results...
And propose to Misa!
％Ｂ
「Pheeew...」
I even ended up participating in an after-party...
Azuma-san's apparently mellowed out somewhat recently, but I heard that having three or four after-parties used to be the norm after losing competitions.

But I understand how he feels.
It sucks to know that the work that you poured your blood, sweat, and tears into will never see the light of day.

Looks like I'll have to learn to deal with these kinds of feelings if I'm gonna continue on as an architect...

％Ｂ
「And... I'm home.」
％Ｂ
「Huh? The light's on...」
Did I forget to turn it off this morning?
That was careless of me.
I'll need to be careful from now on...
％Ｂ
「Phew...」
I undo my necktie.
It may have been a party, but I can't just put aside social rank when it's a work-related event.

I feel like I can finally fully relax after taking my tie off.
I think I'll go and take a shower while I'm at it.\n\r
This is my apartment. I don't need to be considerate of anyone.
％Ｂ
「All right. Today's over!」
I strip off my suit and even throw my underwear aside.
I'll just clean all that up later!
Misa
「U-Umm～」
％Ｂ
「...Wha.」
Suddenly, I hear a voice.
An awkward, hesitant voice, directed at the naked me.
Misa
「I think... you should fold your clothes properly when you take them off...」

％Ｂ
「Misa...?」
Misa
「Y-Yes...」
％Ｂ
「Uh...」
She smiles awkwardly.
I'm standing before her, as naked as the day I was born... Not a single thread on me...

％Ｂ
「A-Aahhh...! M-My bad!」
I frantically stoop forward to cover myself up.
Misa
「O-Oh, no... It-It's completely fine! This is your house, after all... A-And it isn't like... I'm unused to seeing that...」


Misa
「O-Oh, no... It-It's completely fine. This is your house, after all... A-And it isn't like... I'm unused to seeing that...」


％Ｂ
「Yeah, but...」
The circumstances are totally different, so...

％Ｂ
「A-Actually... Why are you here?」
Misa
「Oh, umm, I already explained to you on LIME...」
％Ｂ
「Wha... D-Did you?」
all
I rummage through my suit pocket with one hand, covering myself up with the other.\n\r

I try to check my phone...
％Ｂ
「Oh, sorry. I'm out of battery.」
My screen stays black.
It must have run out while I was still at the bar.
Misa
「O-Oh, then I must apologize. I was wondering why there was no response, but...」

Misa
「U-Umm... You sent me a message in the evening, and you seemed very depressed...」

％Ｂ
「Y-Yeah, I did...」
I sent her a message to let her know that we lost in the competition.
I tried to make sure she wouldn't worry, but it looks like I wasn't able to hide it.

Misa
「I simply... wanted to try to cheer you up somehow... so I thought I might intrude tonight... That was the gist of the message I sent.」


％Ｂ
「Really...」
Misa
「I was worried after you didn't respond... but I still wanted to see your face... so as rude as it is, I...」

Misa does have a spare key for here.
I've also told her she's free to come and go as she pleases.
It's my fault that I didn't notice that my phone was out of battery...
Misa
「Hauh...」
She's pointedly looking everywhere other than me, clearly unsure of where to rest her eyes.
％Ｂ
「S-Sorry. I'm gonna go take a shower real quick.」
Misa
「Y-Yes! I'll be waiting here.」
％Ｂ
「Sorry about this, but could you grab me a towel?」
Misa
「Oh, yes. Over here, yes?」
She's more than familiar with this place.
She goes to grab a towel without hesitation and hands it to me.

Misa
「And underwear and pajamas too～」
She hands me my favorite sweatpants and jersey too.
all
％Ｂ
「Phew...」
I step out of the bathroom, toweling off my hair.
I've finally calmed down.
％Ｂ
「Oh... You hung up my suit. Thanks.」

Misa
「Oh no, please don't pay it any mind. You will be wearing it again tomorrow, won't you?」

She's hung up the suit that I flung off of myself prim and proper up on a hanger.

Misa
「I've also ironed your pants.」
％Ｂ
「So you did...」
They're nicely pleated, without any creases.
And my necktie's been neatly rolled up, as if it were on display at a store.

Misa
「I've put your underwear in the washing machine. I left your shirt separate, because I assumed you would be bringing it to a dry cleaner's.」

％Ｂ
「You did all that... Sorry about this.」
Misa
「It's fine. You seem tired today. I'll take care of everything for you.」

％Ｂ
「Seriously...?」
Misa
「Yes. If that would bring you peace.」
Even though she's probably tired from work too.
Her concern for me fills my heart.
％Ｂ
「I'll take you up on the offer, then. Thanks.」

Misa
「Ufufu... Then, tada! A hair dryer!」

％Ｂ
「You're even gonna dry my hair?」
Misa
「Yes! ...Please sit down over here.」
％Ｂ
「S-Sure.」
all
She bids me to sit on the floor.
Misa kneels and starts pointing the hair dryer at me.

Misa
「Is there anywhere that itches～?」
％Ｂ
「...Don't people say that when they're washing your hair?」
Misa
「Oh yes, that's true～」
％Ｂ
「But the top of my head's itchy, so it might be nice if you could scratch it.」
Misa
「Please allow me to do so! Is it around here?」

％Ｂ
「A bit more to the left, oh, up a bit... A-Aahhhh～ ...There, that's it...」

Misa
「Ufufufu...」
％Ｂ
「I feel so spoiled right now...」
Misa
「This is thanks for you always being so kind to me. You often dry my hair when you stay over.」

％Ｂ
「Well, that's 'cause... I'm sure it's a lot of work for you with how long your hair is.」
Misa
「It really is～ But I don't want to cut it short, as my boyfriend likes it very much...」


Misa
「I often have conversations like that at the salon.」
％Ｂ
「D-Do you now...」
Misa
「They always say, "He must be a very kind and cool boyfriend."」

Can't make light of a woman's salon network...
I can probably assume they know pretty much everything about me.
Though that doesn't necessarily make me feel bad.
Misa
「Okay, done! Is this to your liking, sir～?」

She grabs the mirror from off my desk and shows me.
％Ｂ
「Oh my, I look super cool.」
Misa
「Don't you think! You're very, very cool! So cool I'd like to kiss you!」

％Ｂ
「Wha... That much?」
Misa
「Yes... That much.」
％Ｂ
「Then...」
Misa
「Y-Yes... I... will kiss you.」

Misa
「Mmm... chu.」
We gently place our lips together.
I can taste just a hint of cherry.
％Ｂ
「Misa... did you put on lip balm earlier?」
Misa
「Oh... E-Ehehe... You noticed...」
Misa
「It's just, it would be terrible if my makeup was falling apart... so I fixed it just a bit while you were in the shower.」

％Ｂ
「Really...」
Misa
「Kyah!」
I squeeze her tight.
Misa
「Anh... Nh, nh, nnnhh... Nh... Fh, aah...」

This time, it's my turn to kiss her.
％Ｂ
「Thank you, Misa.」
I whisper into her ear.
％Ｂ
「I can't lose heart over something like this. This isn't the end. I'll make something out of the next opportunity for sure.」


％Ｂ
「I'm... gonna do my best.」
I declare it right to those eyes of hers.
Misa
「...Eheeeh...」
％Ｂ
「Wh-What are you smiling like that for?」
Misa
「I was just thinking to myself... that I really do have a very cool boyfriend.」

％Ｂ
「Why you cute little...」
Misa
「Noo... Mm, chuuu!」
％Ｂ
「Mmh... chu...」
all
I hold her close, and kiss her again.
I love her so much.
％Ｂ
「...Hm?」
Suddenly, I hear some kind of electronic sound.
％Ｂ
「Huh? Wait... Did I leave an alarm on or something?」
But I'm pretty sure I don't have an alarm that sounds like this...
Misa
「Oh... That would be my phone. I set an alarm.」

％Ｂ
「Did you? For what?」
Misa
「Umm... The last bus home.」
％Ｂ
「What!? It's already that late!?」
I guess that makes sense.
I got out of work after 6, and drank for about four hours...

％Ｂ
「Uhh... Do your parents know?」
Misa
「Umm, well you see... I've been staying at the lab so much lately... and it seems even my father's generous store of patience is about to run out on the matter...」


％Ｂ
「Then you've gotta go home!」
Misa
「Y-Yes!」
％Ｂ
「All right, let's go! I'll come with!」
all
I frantically throw a jacket on.
Misa
「What? But wouldn't that mean you won't be able to go home...?」
Misa
「What? But wouldn't that mean you won't be able to go home...?」
％Ｂ
「Uhh... I'll just ask Shuuichi if he can drive me back. Anyway, let's get going!」

Misa
「Y-Yes!」
all
We hurry out from my apartment.
