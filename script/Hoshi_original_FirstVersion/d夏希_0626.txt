「Fuaaaahhh... afh... Aghh... I'm tired...」
...I stayed up way too late last night talking to Segawa.
I didn't get any sleep.
％Ｂ
「Talking until my phone ran out of battery was a bit too much...」
Well, who cares. It was fun.
Marika
「Good morning.」
％Ｂ
「Hey... Shinozaki. Morning.」
Marika
「You seem kind of sleepy still.」
％Ｂ
「Mm... Just a bit, yeah.」
％Ｂ
「Oh... Right... There's something I wanna talk to everyone about today after school, once we're all together for event committee stuff.」

Marika
「You want to talk? About what?」
％Ｂ
「Mmm... I guess it's something private...」
Marika
「Something you can't tell me now?」
％Ｂ
「It's not like I can't right now, but I think it might be easier to just tell everyone at the same time.」

Marika
「Hmm... Okay. I'll look forward to it, then.」
％Ｂ
「No, you don't really have to look forward to it... Anyway, yeah, it'll be after school.」

％Ｂ
「Yooo...」
Rikka
「...Morning.」
％Ｂ
「Morning, Narusafuaaaahhh...」
Rikka
「...Could you not yawn in the middle of my name?」
％Ｂ
「Right... My bad...」
all
％Ｂ
「Hm...?」
Segawa's already in her seat.
％Ｂ
「Morning, Segawa.」
Natsuki
「Wha... Oh... M-Morning...」
...What's she so flustered for...?
％Ｂ
「You get much sleep last night?」
Natsuki
「None at all... I was too nervous...」
％Ｂ
「Nervous... about what?」
Segawa stiffly looks around at our surroundings.
Natsuki
「Looks like everyone's almost here.」
％Ｂ
「Huh? Yeah... Since it's almost homeroom.」
Natsuki
「Then... Now's the time...!」
％Ｂ
「Wha...? Now's the time... for what―」
all
％Ｂ
「...Segawa?」
Segawa suddenly stands up from her seat, grabs my arm, and drags me up to the front of the classroom.

％Ｂ
「Wha, huh? Hey???」
What's going on?
The heck is she trying to do...?
Natsuki
「Hi everyone! There's something we want you all to hear!」
Everyone looks at Segawa as she yells and pounds on the podium.

％Ｂ
「Wha... H-Hey... Segawa? What are you trying―」
Gasp...!
W-Wait a second, she's not going to...!?
Natsuki
「Th-The truth is... I...! As of yesterday, I'm dating 
Hino
him
!」

Rikka
「...」
When I said "tell everyone"─
I meant the event committee people.
But "everyone" for Segawa also includes all of our classmates...
Natsuki
「...Huh?」
all
The classroom's so quiet you could hear a pin drop.
They're not super weirded out, are they...?
％Ｂ
「Wha...」
Female Classmate A
「Congratulations, Segawa-san!」
Female Classmate B
「That's great! Congratulations!」
Male Classmate A
「Come on man, it's only been a month since you transferred in! Heads over heels already?」

Male Classmate B
「Nice going
, Hino
 man, dammit
!」
Female Classmate C
「I've been suspicious for a while now, actually. Since you two were always together.」

Male Classmate C
「So who confessed first? Tell us, tell us!」
Natsuki
「Aw geez... Well, I guess 
Hino 
he 
was the one who confessed?」
％Ｂ
「Hey, don't say that!」
Natsuki
「It's fine, isn't it? You're the one who said we should tell everyone right off the bat, right?」


Ugh, I knew it. She misunderstood...
％Ｂ
「When I said "everyone," I meant the event committee people, and people like Okihara-senpai!」

Natsuki
「Wha...?」
％Ｂ
「I said it'd make working with them easier too, remember? That's 'cause I was talking about event committee work!」

Natsuki
「Oh...」
Natsuki
「Wait a second... Did I totally mess this up!?」
％Ｂ
「You totally messed it up.」
Natsuki
「Auuuh...」
Rikka
「They were acting like they were fighting yesterday, and now this... What's with them...?」

all
Natsuki
「Sigh... I'm sorry～ ...This is all because I jumped to conclusions...」
％Ｂ
「Well... There's nothing we can do about it now that the truth's out. It all worked out in the end.」

Natsuki
「Yeah... I was happy that everyone was happy for us.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah... To be honest, I felt a little emotional too. I didn't think they'd congratulate us so much.」

Natsuki
「I heard someone say she's been suspicious of us for a while now.」
％Ｂ
「I guess we were always together just that much.」
Second-Year Girl A
「Hey, isn't it those two? Them.」
Second-Year Girl B
「Huh? What do you mean? What about those two?」
％Ｂ
「Hm...?」
There are some girls from another class whispering about something while looking at us.

Second-Year Girl A
「Come on, they're the two that declared they were dating before their morning homeroom!」
％Ｂ
「Hgh...!?」
Second-Year Girl B
「Ohh, that thing we could hear all the way out in the hallway! Huh, so it's those two.」

Second-Year Girl A
「They must be super lovey-dovey if they wanted everyone in their class to know like that.」

Natsuki
「It kinda... seems like there's even people from other classes who know about it...」

％Ｂ
「Y-Yeah... Something about how they could hear it from out in the hall...」
I didn't think that it'd even become a rumor among other classes.
Shinozaki and the others might've already heard about it by the time we talk after school at this rate...

all
％Ｂ
「Err... And so I would like to report that Segawa Natsuki and I
, Hino Ryousuke,

 have happily decided to begin dating.」


Shuuichi
「Yeah, I know.」
Misa
「I received the news during lunch break.」
Sora
「...Second-period break.」
Touko
「I think I heard around the same time.」
Marika
「...I heard about it right after morning homeroom ended.」

％Ｂ
「Yeahhh... I thought you might all know alreadyyy...」
So I guess the rumor spread after all...
If even the other years know... then I guess that means the entire school knows...
Natsuki
「Man, sorry for causing such a fuss.」
Touko
「It's just like you to not look guilty at all about it, Camera-chan.」

Natsuki
「I do regret my actions a little, you know...」
Shuuichi
「Actually, I thought you two were already secretly together since a long time ago.」

Touko
「They were always together, after all.」
％Ｂ
「...We've already heard that from everyone else today.」
Natsuki
「We weren't dating or anything before yesterday, though.」
all
Misa
「But, with that being the case, this does not come as a particularly surprising development. It is to be celebrated, of course.」

％Ｂ
「Thank you very much, Senpai.」
all
％Ｂ
「And thanks to you too, Ousaka. I was able to find Segawa yesterday thanks to you.」

Sora
「...Issue resolved.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. Thanks.」
all
Marika
「Congratulations, you two. I think you two are great for each other.」
Natsuki
「Mhm, thanks, Marika.」
all
Shuuichi
「Hmph... So now you've finally got something to protect too. Looks like you've finally caught up to me.」

％Ｂ
「...Why are you acting so superior?」
Shuuichi
「Do your best to not get sat on all over, I guess.」
％Ｂ
「Like I wanna hear that from someone who's being sat on.」
Shuuichi
「Ah? The hell'd you say?」
Marika
「Aghh... It's started again...」
Shuuichi
「Kaori-san's butt isn't big enough to sit on me!」
％Ｂ
「Segawa's butt's on the smaller side too.」
Shuuichi
「What, you've seen it?」
％Ｂ
「Hell yeah, I have! When she wore her swimsuit! It's tight and juicy―」

all
％Ｂ
「Mgyhhhhhh!?」
Natsuki
「What the heck do you think you're saying!?」
％Ｂ
「Ughh... I-I was fighting for the sake of your butt's honor...」
Natsuki
「You don't need to say anything unnecessary! I don't care about my butt's honor or anything!」

％Ｂ
「Fine...」
all
Misa
「It appears Natsuki-san is already doing as Shuuichi-san said.」

Sora
「...Master and pet.」
Touko
「Oh, I think that's the perfect way to describe it.」
This is how it goes even now that we're dating...?
When are we gonna be standing on even ground...?
