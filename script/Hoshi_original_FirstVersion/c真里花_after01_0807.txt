「Hmm...」
I'm stuck hmming to myself before this envelope.
I just can't bring myself to open it.
That's right... The results of the First-Class Exam finally arrived.
Actually, they arrived yesterday...
But I just couldn't open the envelope. What if I failed?

I can also check my results online, but I haven't done that either out of fear.

I know I was confident about having "done everything I can" when I took the exam, but now that the results are before me, I can't help but feel scared.

％Ｂ
「I guess I'll look at it after I get home today...」
Today is Tanabata.
It's the day when this city lights up brighter than any other time of year.\n\r
I can already feel the joyous atmosphere of the Tanabata Festival outside.
I've also made plans with Marika for us to go out on a date.
It's our first date in honestly forever, with all the studying I've been doing.
Marika should be here soon.
But I'm sure the mood would be dismal if I found out I had failed the exam.\n\r

That'd ruin the date.
％Ｂ
「So I'll look at it after our date today...」
％Ｂ
「Oh... She's here. I'll open it in just a second!」
Marika
「Ehehe... Excuse meee.」
She comes in right away.
We're spending the whole day together today.
That's why she's in her casual clothes instead of a yukata.
Marika
「...Hmm...?」
％Ｂ
「Wh-What?」
Marika
「I feel like... your expression's kind of stiff?」
％Ｂ
「Is it? I think I'm the same as usual...」
Marika
「...Oh, that envelope... Is that...?」

Looks like Marika's figured it already from my demeanor.

％Ｂ
「Mm... Yeah, it is. It's, uh... the results of the exam last week.」

Marika
「How'd you do?」
％Ｂ
「Well actually... I haven't opened it yet.」
Marika
「What? You haven't looked yet?」
％Ｂ
「It's fine. I'll look at it once I get home today. You know, 'cause today's Tanabata... so um, if I...」

Marika
「Whaaat? I think you should look at it right away! Please allow me～」

She then swiftly opens the envelope and takes out the contents.

％Ｂ
「H-Hey, wait a...!」
Marika
「It says you passed! You got it!」
％Ｂ
「...What? S-Seriously?」
Marika
「Yes seriously～ Here, see for yourself.」

She shows me the paper that was inside.
She's right. It says "Pass" on it.
％Ｂ
「Oh man... I passed...」
I almost crumple onto the ground out of relief.
And man, I was worried about this since yesterday, but Marika resolved it in just a few seconds.

Women sure are strong in times like these...
Marika
「So then... Congratulations!!」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, thanks! But there's still the drafting exam, so I can't be too happy yet...」

Marika
「It'll be fiiine～! You said drafting was one of your specialties, and that you were sure you'd pass if you got this far!」


％Ｂ
「Well yeah, I'm confident, but...」
Marika
「So it'll be okay for sure, then! I'll guarantee it!」
Marika gives me her seal of approval and looks me right in the eye without even a hint of doubt.\n\r

Her unconditional belief in me is heartening.
％Ｂ
「Thanks. I'll do my best. But... let's just forget about exams for today and have fun!」

Marika
「Okay!」
Marika
「Wow, this is so nostalgic～」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, it is.」
We walk through our alma mater for the first time in forever.
It's the exact same, nostalgic place.
％Ｂ
「It's already been... more than six years since we graduated. Time sure flies.」

Marika
「Everyone's so young～」
Marika smiles as she watches all the uniform-wearing students walk by.
％Ｂ
「You could definitely still pull off the uniform, Marika.」
Marika
「Whaaat? I really don't think so～」
％Ｂ
「I'm sure of it. That Alice-style outfit from before looked really good on you too.」

Marika
「W-Well... You complimented me lots on that, but～」

She's bright red.
I really do think she could still pull it off.
Marika
「Oh, it's here. See? It says "stargazing aquarium."」

She's right. It says so on a sign at the entrance to the classroom.
％Ｂ
「So they really are still doing it...」
The location's different, since the old school building got torn down, but the actual display's still here.

％Ｂ
「Look, it says it's a collaborative effort between the naturalist and astronomy clubs. Kinda makes you happy to see this, huh?」

Our stargazing aquarium was apparently popular enough that it's become a staple display in the years since.\n\r

I hear the astronomy and naturalist clubs are both full of members now.
all
Female Student
「Welcome! Please, come on in and take a look!」

A female student walks up to us while we're standing around by the entrance and gestures us inside.

％Ｂ
「Thank you. Are you in the astronomy club, or the naturalist club?」
Astronomy Club Member
「I'm in the astronomy club. Are you alumni, perhaps?」

％Ｂ
「Yeah. I wasn't in either of those clubs... but I did help them out a bit.」

Astronomy Club
「Was the stargazing aquarium being done back when you went here too?」
％Ｂ
「Y-Yeah, it was. It started while I was around.」

I specifically don't say I was involved with starting it.
It'd be kinda embarrassing to say that we were the ones that thought of the idea in the first place.

Astronomy Club Member
「Oh really! I actually decided to apply for this school because I happened to see the stargazing aquarium here.」


Marika
「What? Oh really!」
all
Astronomy Club Member
「I've always liked the stars too, of course... but knowing that people in my generation had made something this amazing got me inspired.」


Astronomy Club Member
「I was like, "I definitely want to try doing that too!"」
％Ｂ
「Wow～ Really.」
I can't stop myself from grinning.
They'll think I'm weird if I'm too smiley.
Astronomy Club Member
「I don't mean to brag, but the planetarium this year is amazing. I think you'll even be able to just make out the Milky Way.」

％Ｂ
「What? It's that good? Now that's amazing...」
Astronomy Club Member
「But it's not like we did all of the work. We've inherited the planetarium pieces that the original club members made, and we've been adding new stars every year.」


Marika
「What? So then... that means that those are the pieces that we made...?」
Astronomy Club Member
「Huh? I thought you said you weren't astronomy club members...」
％Ｂ
「Uh, never mind! Okay, then we'll definitely have to see it. Can we go in?」


all
Astronomy Club Member
「Of course! Go right ahead!」
Marika
「It really was beautiful～」
Marika still looks entranced.
But it really was a stunning night sky. 
％Ｂ
「The things that we made are still being used... I got a bit emotional.」

Marika
「Yep, yep. It's really amazing.」
Marika
「Our feelings created a "place" for those students.」

％Ｂ
「What? We made a place for them?」
Marika
「It's a place where they can do their best. A place to make lots of memories. It was like they were all shining.」


Now that she mentions it, they did look really happy.
The things we left behind, that place, is serving a role like that...
I feel something surge up in my chest at the thought.
Marika
「Isn't it great? Your wish came true, Ryousuke.」

Marika
「Isn't it great? Your wish came true.」

％Ｂ
「...Yeah.」
all
I recall those letters from the graduating students in the old school building.
All of those letters spelling out the golden years of their youth here at this school, left in that broken locker.

All of their memories glittered like gold.
I wonder if the things we left behind are helping create those glittering memories.

I want to create places like that for lots more people from now on.
I want to help them that way.
I... genuinely, honestly think so.
And...
％Ｂ
「...」
Marika
「...Hm? What is it?」
％Ｂ
「Oh, no... It's nothing.」
And more than anything...
I wish, from the bottom of my heart, that I can be a place where the person most important to me can be happy.

I hear something that sounds like someone's hitting a big drum in the sky.
And after a slight delay, a huge flower blooms.
It's the climax of the festival. The fireworks.
Marika
「Wow, look, look! They go "booom," and then another one goes "booom"... It's so pretty～」


A smile blooms on Marika's face with every flower that blooms in the sky.
％Ｂ
「It was definitely a good idea to come over here.」
There are other spots with a better view, but those places are way too crowded.
It's hard to even move about, like a fully packed train.
We've moved away from the commotion, a little further away.
There's hardly anyone else here.
It's a little-known place that we've managed to find only because we're so familiar with this area.
Marika
「Hehe... We have the place to ourselves.」
She shows me a cheerful smile.
She leans against me.
Marika
「Ehehe. Nice and easy.」
She entrusts her weight to me and smiles like a kid.
Her comfortable weight fills up my heart.
And it also strengthens my thoughts.
I want to be the one to make the place that's important to her.
I... want to become that place.
％Ｂ
「Marika... I wanna talk about something.」
More drumbeats in the sky.
It seems weirdly fast-paced.
No... I'm hearing this sound from inside myself.
My heart suddenly starts to beat frantically, as if it's only just now remembered it needs to beat.

Marika
「...About... Oh, y-yes... What would that be～?」

Marika's expression also turns serious. She must've picked up on my nervousness.
She pulls away and turns toward me.
％Ｂ
「Well.. It's about the architect exam...」
％Ｂ
「I've only passed the subject portion so far, and I've still got the drafting exam... but I'll pass that for sure too. I'll definitely get first-class qualifications...」


Marika
「Mhm...」
％Ｂ
「And I'm sure I'll get more things to do once I've got that, and my pay'll go up too. I'm still a novice... but I think that'll help me take the next step forward.」


Marika
「...Mhm.」
％Ｂ
「I can't really save up now... and all I've been doing is causing you trouble... but I'll make you happy from now on. So...」


Marika
「...Mhm.」
％Ｂ
「...So... Once I pass the first-class architect exam... When I pass...」


I can't seem to say those important words.
My heart feels like it might give out.
But I muster my courage and say the words.
％Ｂ
「I want us to get married.」
I wring the words out of me.
Another firework explodes in the sky at that exact moment.
It lights up the area, illuminating Marika within the darkness.
Marika
「...Yes! If you're fine with me, then I'd love to!」
％Ｂ
「...What?」
I ask on reflex. Her response was just so casual.

％Ｂ
「Y-You sure?」
Marika
「Yeah, it's okay.」
％Ｂ
「Really?」
Marika
「Of course. I can't even imagine being together with anyone other than you, Ryousuke. There's no one else for me.」


Marika
「Of course. I can't even imagine being together with anyone other than you. There's no one else for me.」


Marika
「That's why... I'm so happy...」
Her eyes begin to glisten.
Tears.
％Ｂ
「Marika...」
Marika
「Hnnh... I'm so happy～ ...It's like I suddenly realized that this is really happening... Hgh...」

Marika
「I-I may be this way... but I'll be in your care... Hgh, hgh... Please make me your bride～」


％Ｂ
「No, same for me... I'll also be in your care...」
Marika
「I may be incompentent, but～ Hgh... A-Ahaha...」

We stiffly lower our heads back and forth.
We both laugh when we realize how ridiculous we must look.
Marika
「...Hehe. We're so silly...」
％Ｂ
「I swear I'll pass the exam. I'll... definitely make you happy.」

Marika
「Yes...! Please do!」
I grip Marika's hand. It's wet from wiping her tears.
I feel like just doing that's enough to fill my entire body with happiness.
all
The drafting exam... I'll definitely have to pass.
