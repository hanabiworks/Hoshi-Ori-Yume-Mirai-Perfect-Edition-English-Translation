...I haven't gotten much sleep.
I was so excited after getting home last night that I wasn't able to sleep.
Eventually, the sky lightened and birds were singing. I tried to sleep so I wouldn't end up falling asleep at school, but my consciousness refused to fade.


And so I made my way to my seat without even a wink of sleep, powered by nothing more than wanting to see Narusawa.

％Ｂ
「Fuaaah... Gh, ahhh～ ...Tired...」
My fatigue bears down on me all at once when I sit down.
I wanted to stay awake, at least until Narusawa showed up, but...
Rikka
「...kun... Wake up...」
Shake shake.
Someone's shaking me comfortably as I sleep.
％Ｂ
「Nnh... ngh...」
There's a sweet, gentle smell... A smell that I love...
Shake shake.
Rikka
「...Wake up. Homeroom is starting soon.」
％Ｂ
「Afh... Fuaaah...」
％Ｂ
「...Narusawa?」
Rikka
「Hehe... Good morning.」
％Ｂ
「M-Morning...」
All of my sleepiness goes flying away when I hear her gentle voice.
My blood starts pumping faster in exchange.
The girl I love is right in front of me.
She's a very precious girl who's agreed to be my girlfriend.
I know for sure I'd be rolling on the floor in happiness if this were my room.
Rikka
「...」
Narusawa looks around a bit, and after checking to see that there isn't anyone looking at us...

And she gently pats my hair.
％Ｂ
「Wha... Uh, um...」
Rikka
「You had a bit of bed hair. Okay, it's better now.」
％Ｂ
「Th-Thanks.」
Rikka
「You're welcome.」
all
Narusawa casually sits down at her seat, as if nothing's happened.
She sure is amazing...
My heart feels like it might explode at any moment, but she seems so relaxed.

I am a bit surprised that she touched my hair, though.
Narusawa would have pointed out my bed hair before, but she never would have touched me. 

Is this a sign that we're really boyfriend and girlfriend?
Rikka
「Uuuh...」
My heart's still pounding loudly after I sit down.
It might have been a bit bold of me to touch Hino-kun's hair.

It might have been a bit bold of me to touch ％Ａ-kun's hair.

I could've just pointed it out instead of fixing it myself...
I was so nervous that I was almost a little afraid of going to school...
But I was a little relieved when I saw Hino-kun sleeping at his seat after I walked in.

But I was a little relieved when I saw ％Ａ-kun sleeping at his seat after I walked in.

I felt so happy seeing his sleeping face. I stopped caring about time passing.
I looked at him over and over while pretending to prepare for class.

It was wonderful.
But after I woke him up a little before the first bell, after hearing his voice, looking into his eyes... I just wanted to touch him.

I think the bed hair was just a convenient excuse.
Now that I've become Hino-kun's girlfriend... This is a me that I don't know... I don't really know myself that well now.

Now that I've become ％Ａ-kun's girlfriend... This is a me that I don't know... I don't really know myself that well now.

Natsuki
「Rikkaaa!」
Rikka
「...?」
Segawa-san's waving me over.

I approach her, and she hands me a cute-looking rectangular envelope a little larger than my hand.

Rikka
「What's this?」
Natsuki
「It's your birthday present! Since I wasn't able to get you something yesterday.」
Rikka
「Oh... Thank you.」
Natsuki
「Ahh, you probably shouldn't open that here... It's filled with a bunch of photos of Hino.」
Natsuki
「Ah, you probably shouldn't open that here... It's filled with a bunch of photos of him.」
Rikka
「...! 
Of Hino-kun
Of
...?」
I glance his way.
He's talking to a male friend near his seat.
Looks like he hasn't noticed... Thank goodness.
Natsuki
「I've got ones I took for grad-alb stuff, but I've also got ones I asked him to be in. Ones where he's looking right at the camera.」

Rikka
「When did you take all of these?」
Natsuki
「Don't underestimate my footwork now, okay?」
Rikka
「But these photos...」
Natsuki
「Don't want them?」
Rikka
「...I don't... not want them.」
Natsuki
「Here you go, then. Feel free to enjoy them as you see fit, whether you put them in frames or look at them and smile.」
Rikka
「I... think I will smile. Thank you...」
I quietly place the envelope in my pocket, making sure not to fold the contents.
I can't just sit around happy forever.
The retake for the music practical exam is tomorrow.
I'm taking off from committee duties today for a final last-minute cram, and Narusawa's helping me with practice after school today too.


I'm singing the song for my retake with Narusawa's piano accompaniment.
The song's in Italian, but I've somehow managed to memorize the lyrics, and I don't think my pitch is off either, thanks to Narusawa's help.

I await Narusawa's judgment after finishing.
Rikka
「Most of your notes were right. You were just a little off at the end.」

％Ｂ
「I knew it. I thought I went a little high there too. Maybe I got a little ahead of myself since the rest went so well.」

Rikka
「Hehe... You'll just have to stay focused until the end. Let's try again, from the top.」

all
Time passes sweetly in the music classroom.
I've never experienced anything like this before... Is this what it feels like to spend time together with a lover?
I feel like there's an indescribable sweetness wafting through the air.
We might be able to have some time to enjoy ourselves alone once we're done practicing...

Or so I thought, but...
Clatter...
Natsuki
「Hey, Rikka, is the program for the Shio-cademy Fest done?」

Rikka
「It is. I'll give it to you later.」
％Ｂ
「Segawa. Why's your camera at the ready?」
all
Clatter...
Shuuichi
「Yo. I've brought you some snacks.」
％Ｂ
「Thanks. Hm? Why mints?」
Shuuichi
「It's a man's etiquette. Good luck.」
all
Clatter...
Marika
「Um, um... Umm... Why am I here?」
％Ｂ
「Why would I know?」
all
...There are a lot of people visiting the music classroom today for some reason.
To an unnatural degree.
And I can hear whispering from the hallway.
％Ｂ
「...I'm gonna go see what's going on.」
Shuuichi
「Hey, Segawa. You said they'd be kissing!」
Natsuki
「That's weird. I thought for sure they'd do it once they were alone!」

Marika
「I really don't think they'd do it at school...」
Natsuki
「Maybe he wimped out and hasn't even confessed?」
Shuuichi
「What am I supposed to do now? I bought those snacks for nothing.」
Segawa and the others are crouched down in a circle in the hall.
％Ｂ
「...What are you, delinquents loitering in front of a convenience store?」
Marika
「Eeek!」
Natsuki
「Run!」
Shuuichi
「Now is the time for my soccer-trained leg muscles to shiiiine!」
They bolt down the hall at full speed.
Marika
「Waaaaahhh! You two are so meeean～! Don't leave me behiiiind!」

all
Shinozaki follows after them...
They scattered like roaches.
％Ｂ
「Honestly.」
Rikka
「Hehe...」
I walk back into the classroom to find Narusawa giggling.
Rikka
「Hey, is it okay if we tell Segawa-san and the others that we're dating?」

Rikka
「I've actually been talking to them a lot through LIME recently, and they're worried about our relationship. I think that's why they were here.」

％Ｂ
「Huh, really.」
I'm a little surprised that she's been in touch with the others like that, but I'm also really happy.

A month ago, she wouldn't have ever tried to interact with others. But now, she has a few people she can call friends―

And she can smile like this when talking about those friends.
％Ｂ
「I think it's fine. There's no need to hide it anyway.」
Rikka
「Thank you.」
％Ｂ
「You don't need to thank me. It's about both of us.」
Rikka
「Hehe, you're right.」
Rikka
「Shall we continue our practice, then?」
％Ｂ
「Please do.」
all
Rikka
「Okay. I don't think you'll have any issue passing the retake now.」
％Ｂ
「All right!」
I fist-pump on reflex.
Now that Narusawa-sensei herself has placed her seal of approval on my performance, all that's left is to showcase my efforts on the actual retake.

％Ｂ
「Still, you're pretty relaxed, huh... Kinda mature, or...」

Rikka
「What do you mean?」
％Ｂ
「Well, I'm crazy nervous right now about having a girlfriend for the first time.」
％Ｂ
「I'm really happy that we're alone together like this, but I've been pretty lost on what I should be doing the whole time.」

Rikka
「Oh... Me too... I'm the same way.」
Rikka
「Ever since you confessed to me yesterday, I've felt tight deep down in my heart. It's tingly, and sweet, and hot...」

She presses her hand tight against her chest.
Rikka
「It's been beating away so fast... It's making such a comfortable rhythm.」

Rikka
「Everything's so new to me... I don't know what I should be doing either.」

％Ｂ
「So I guess we were both the same way after all.」
So it wasn't just me who was nervous about being in a relationship for the first time.
Knowing that we're both the same―that our feelings are one―makes me happy.

％Ｂ
「It's hard, huh? We were just friends the day before yesterday, but now we're suddenly boyfriend and girlfriend. I have no idea what's really changed yet.」

Rikka
「That's true. We were one way before, and we're extending that, but it's a little different...」

％Ｂ
「But you know, there are a lot of things I wanna do. Stuff we couldn't do as friends.」

Rikka
「Like?」
％Ｂ
「Well, let's see... I wanna spoil you and stuff.」
Rikka
「Spoil...? What do you mean?」
％Ｂ
「Like link arms and stuff.」
Rikka
「Link... Uuuh...」
She moans quietly in embarrassment.
％Ｂ
「Though it's super embarrassing for me to just imagine it too.」

Rikka
「Wha, wha... But, really...?」
Maybe she's never really done anything like that.
She looks around restlessly.
She looks up at me with damp, bashful eyes.
Rikka
「...Is it okay?」
％Ｂ
「That's cheating.」
Rikka
「What?」
Her long pretty hair flutters as she tilts her head a bit.
She probably wouldn't get it...
％Ｂ
「Uh, I mean... I'm your boyfriend, so you don't have to ask. Do it whenever you want.」

Rikka
「You shouldn't say anything that you'll regret.」
％Ｂ
「I'd never regret saying that.」
Rikka
「Then... Then, um... Could you come here?」
Narusawa steps away from the piano and places two chairs next to each other.

She sits down in one of them and pats the chair next to her, red up to her ears and neck.

Her movements are really stiff and awkward.
Ah, I get it.
all
I can guess her intentions. I sit down.
Rikka
「...～～～～～. ～～～～～～～～. ～～～～～～～～～～」
Rikka
「Please excuse me... for a moment.」
Squeeze.
I can feel a very soft, slender something wrap around my upper arm.
Then a nice, girly smell wafts over me. And then Narusawa's face makes contact with my shoulder.

％Ｂ
「...!」
I definitely was not expecting her to stick this close.
Narusawa's pink all over, like she's about to start boiling. Looks like this took her a lot of courage too.

I bet I look similar.
Rikka
「This... is making my heart go crazy. Even more than I thought...」
Rikka
「U-Uuuh... I know I wanted to do this... but I can't...!」
％Ｂ
「Uh, wanna pull away, then?」
Rikka
「...No.」
She shakes her head over and over.
Her hair's a little ticklish on my neck.
Rikka
「I don't want to pull away either. Because you said it was okay for me to do this. I want to be like this for longer...」


Rikka
「I'm selfish, aren't I? ...I'm sorry.」
％Ｂ
「I'm totally okay with this kinda selfishness anytime.」
I'm surprisingly calm.
I was nervous before because I felt like I needed to take the lead as the guy, but that's faded a bit after seeing how nervous Narusawa is.

％Ｂ
「I think I wanna try another thing once we're used to this.」
Rikka
「Another thing?」
％Ｂ
「That thing where the girl sits on the guy's lap.」
Rikka
「Oh... O-Okay... Another time, sure...」
Rikka
「But not right now... I think I'd go crazy if I did that...」
％Ｂ
「Haha...」
And I think I'm gonna go crazy seeing her like this.

all
％Ｂ
「―So yeah, we're dating now.」
I have Shuuichi and Segawa stay after the committee, ask Okihara-senpai and the others to come too, and tell them about our relationship.

Shuuichi
「Hoh, so you finally said it. Or maybe Narusawa said it first?」

％Ｂ
「It was me.」
Shuuichi
「Really. I was a bit worried about whether you'd be able to do it. Either way, congratulations.」

all
Natsuki
「Thank god. I'm glad we gave that advice.」
％Ｂ
「Advice?」
Rikka
「S-Segawa-san!」
Natsuki
「Ahaha! So you've at least kissed already, right?」

Rikka
「...No, why would we?」
I can see her cheeks coloring up as she turns away.
Sora
「Good. Better friends.」
all
Touko
「You guys pretty much looked that way for a while now. It's actually happened kinda late, don't you think?」
all
Marika
「Congratulations
, Hino-kun. 
. 
I'm really happy for you!」

Misa
「Yes, I am very glad to see Rikka-san so happy. Congratulations to you two.」

Everyone celebrates us.
all
Natsuki
「Still, what a surprise～ You seemed like you'd be the last one to get a boyfriend out of any of us.」

Marika
「H-Hey... That's rude!」
all
Rikka
「I don't really mind. It's a surprise to me too.」
Touko
「And so, Piano-chan, what part of him struck a chord in your heart?」

Sora
「I'm interested. How'd you start dating?」
Misa
「I am also slightly curious. If you could tell me for the sake of future reference.」

Narusawa shrinks back in response to the other girls' questions and curious looks.
Rikka
「Uh... Wh-Why do I have to answer that?」
Touko
「Oh, come ooon. You're the only person here with a boyfriend here now.」
Natsuki
「The no-boyfriend league wants to support you, but we're jealous too.」

Rikka
「I don't recall ever hearing about any such league.」
Marika
「Huh? Wait a second, am I a member of that league too...?」
all
Natsuki
「It's a maiden's union that you can never leave until you get a boyfriend.」
Marika
「Whaaat～ ...Whaaaat～ ...I don't think I'll ever be able to leave...」

all
Touko
「So now that you're an alumna, you have to lead the way for the others.」


Misa
「It means you are now an upperclassman when it comes to love!」
all
Rikka
「I'm never telling you. Ever.」
Natsuki
「Looks like things are going to get rowdy again tonight～」
Rikka
「No one would ever answer when they know they're going to be teased for it.」

Sora
「I want to know.」
Rikka
「...I won't... tell you.」
Her response isn't as firm against Ousaka's begging.
Narusawa might crumble pretty soon.
I'm just glad that she's been talking a lot more with the others than I thought.
all
％Ｂ
「So anyway, please watch over us warmly.」
Rikka
「Mmmh... I don't even care if they do.」
Narusawa's sulking a bit from the teasing.
But it looks like everyone knows that she isn't serious.

They all smile warmly.
all
％Ｂ
「It's great that everyone knows now, isn't it?」
It was embarrassing to report something like that to our friends at first, but now that it's over with, I think it was good that we did.

They're important to us, so I want them to know about our relationship, and I want them to celebrate us being together too.

Rikka
「It wasn't great at all. I know I was the one who said we should do it, but I think it was short-sighted of me. Of course they're going to use this as material.」

％Ｂ
「It's kinda like a price of fame thing, maybe? Why not just consider this as another thing that happens to lovers and enjoy it?」

Rikka
「You're saying that because you don't know just how tenacious they are...」

％Ｂ
「What on earth are you all talking about over LIME...? Can I ask?」

Rikka
「You can't.」
％Ｂ
「Figured. I bet there's lots of stuff that you can only talk about with other girls.」


％Ｂ
「It'd be crazy to try to know everything just 'cause I'm your boyfriend.」
I know I've got stuff I can only talk about with Shuuichi and my other guy friends.
Rikka
「That's not it. Well, it is, but...」
％Ｂ
「?」
Rikka
「It's not that I want to keep it a secret from my boyfriend... It's just, um... it's embarrassing. Um, you see...」

Rikka
「...Because all of my conversations with them have been about you...」

％Ｂ
「Oh, really...」
Rikka
「Mhm... Okay, done. We're done talking about that now.」
She forces the conversation to a close.
％Ｂ
「But excuse me, Narusawa-san. That just makes me all the more curious.」

Rikka
「I told you we're done talking about that, geez...」
Her face reddens even more in the sunset.
I can kinda guess at what the details are from that.
％Ｂ
「Mm, okay, sure. We're done talking about that. Then, in exchange―」
I clench my right hand, and then unclench.
I slowly... stiffly slide my hand over...
And hold Narusawa's small hand.
Rikka
「...!」
Her shoulders jerk a little.
I thought this would be fine since we've held hands already before we were dating, but it's actually pretty nerve-racking.

It might be because she's moved from "the girl I like" to "the girl I'm dating" in my mind.

But as the one who initiated the handholding, I have to take the lead.
％Ｂ
「Let's go home. I'll walk you to your building.」
Rikka
「...」
Uh, no response.
I'm a little worried.
Rikka
「Can we continue from after school... Could I... have you spoil me just a little more?」
％Ｂ
「Sure thing.」
Rikka
「Then... I want you to walk me to my door, instead of just to my building.」

Rikka
「I want to be with you... for as long as I can.」
％Ｂ
「What, that's all?」
Rikka
「It... isn't a small thing. I had to try pretty hard to ask, you know.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. I needed to muster up courage to hold your hand just now too.」
I slide my fingers in between hers, and her fingers quiver cutely in response.

She tangles her fingers around my hand too.
Our hands make more contact than if we were holding them normally...
I can feel her warmth, softness, and smoothness directly from the palm of her hand.

Rikka
「Hehehe...」
％Ｂ
「Ahaha...」
all
We're embarrassed and happy.
We laugh and slowly start to make our way to Narusawa's place...
Making sure this time continues for as long as possible.
