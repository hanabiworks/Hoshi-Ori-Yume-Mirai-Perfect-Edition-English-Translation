The next morning.
I check my temperature as soon as I wake up.
％Ｂ
「37.2...」
My fever's gone down, but it hasn't completely gone away yet.
But I feel a lot lighter than yesterday.
％Ｂ
「Hmm... I don't wanna risk making it worse again by forcing myself to go to school...」
I'll call in sick for one more day, just to be safe.
I call the school again to let them know I won't be coming in today either.

％Ｂ
「All right... Let's eat breakfast and take some medicine.」
...And so I spent another day in bed.
Thanks to that, my fever's completely gone by the afternoon.
％Ｂ
「Sigh... And now I've got nothing to do...」
Now that I've recovered, I don't know what to do with the rest of the day.
％Ｂ
「If I sleep now, I won't be able to sleep tonight, and I'm gonna get the one-two punch of getting over being sick and not having slept enough tomorrow...」

％Ｂ
「I guess I'll just start making dinner.」
But there's nothing in my fridge right now other than the sports drinks I bought yesterday.\nSo I guess I'll go to the convenience store to buy―


Natsuki
「We came to visit yoooou!」
％Ｂ
「!!!!!?」
Wh-Why's Segawa suddenly in my room!?
Natsuki
「Oh? You seem healthier than I thought.」
％Ｂ
「S-Segawa...? Couldn't you at least knock before coming in... Wait, no... How the hell did you get in my house!?」

Natsuki
「What do you mean, how? Through the front door, obviously.」
％Ｂ
「The front door? But the door's―」
Marika
「Your door wasn't locked.」
％Ｂ
「Huh? You're here too, Shinozaki? Wait a second... The door wasn't locked?」
Hold on, was I so out of it from my fever that I forgot to lock the door after going out to buy stuff yesterday...?


Scary...
％Ｂ
「Okay, but that doesn't mean you can just walk in, right?」
Marika
「I'm sorry. She told me she wanted to surprise you no matter what.」
Shinozaki sounds apologetic, but she's also smiling a little.
all
Marika
「How are you feeling? You look like you're fine.」
％Ｂ
「Y-Yeah... My fever's gone down after resting lots.」
Marika
「Really. That's great～」
Natsuki
「I was hoping you'd look more like you were dying on your bed. What a disappointmeeent.」

％Ｂ
「It'd be great if you wouldn't just kill me off like that...」
Natsuki
「We brought you a present to get you feeling better too. There isn't going to be an effect now.」

％Ｂ
「A present to make me feel better? Like food or something?」
Natsuki
「Mmm... I guess you could call it food. Though you can't eat it.」
％Ｂ
「What?」
all
Segawa steps out into the hall and comes back immediately.
...With the present in tow.
Natsuki
「Here's your present♪」
Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「Ousaka...?? Why's Ousaka...?」
Marika
「She was wandering around in front of the event committee office after school.」
Natsuki
「So we kidnapped her♪」
Sora
「...」
Natsuki
「She came to our classroom during lunch too. She was peering through the windows looking for you from the hallway.」

％Ｂ
「Looking for me?」
all
Sora
「...Because you didn't come yesterday...」
％Ｂ
「O-Oh, yeah... I woke up with a fever yesterday.」
Sora
「...I heard from Natsu. I didn't know...」
％Ｂ
「Right... I probably should've told you over LIME. It never really crossed my mind 'cause I was in bed all day yesterday... Sorry about that.」


Sora
「...*shake shake*」
％Ｂ
「Thanks for coming.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「...」
Sora
「...」
Crap. The conversation died.
After Ousaka came all the way to my house to come see me because I was sick, too...
all
Natsuki
「Aaall right, then I think we'll go home, Marika.」
Marika
「Mhm, yeah. Since we know 
Hino-kun's 
he's 
feeling better. Enjoy your stay, Ousaka-san.」

％Ｂ
「Huh? You guys are leaving already?」
Marika
「Mhm. Since you seem to be okay now. See you again tomorrow at school.」

Natsuki
「Just making sure we brought you your gift.」
My gift...?
Natsuki
「Listen here, Sora. I don't think he has the energy to attack you since he's still getting over being sick, but make sure you run away as soon as he looks like he might attack.」

Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「No, I'm not gonna attack you... and Ousaka, I wish you wouldn't just nod to that...」
Natsuki
「Later then!」
Marika
「Bye-bye.」
all
They really just up and left...
％Ｂ
「The heck did they even come here for...?」
Did they seriously come just to bring Ousaka here?
How nosy. 
In a good way, of course.
Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「Uhh... Wanna sit down? You can use that chair over there.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
all
Ousaka pulls my desk chair toward the bed and sits in it.
Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「...」
This is kinda making me nervous...
Even though I've already spent countless hours alone with Ousaka up on the roof...\n\r

Maybe it's because we're in my own room?
Sora
「...I'm glad you're feeling better.」
％Ｂ
「Hm? Oh, yeah... I only had a small fever this morning. I'm totally okay now.」

Sora
「...Is it because you got wet in the rain?」
％Ｂ
「Nah, it's my fault for just sitting around without drying my hair and stuff after getting home.」

Sora
「...But...」
％Ｂ
「It's seriously all my fault. More importantly, sorry for not letting you know.」
Sora
「...*shake shake*」
％Ｂ
「Is the telescope okay?」
Sora
「...*nod* No issues with using it now. It's thanks to you
, Ryou

.」
％Ｂ
「Really. So no water leaked in or anything. That's great.」
Sora
「...*nod*...」
％Ｂ
「...Uhh...」
Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「...」
Crap... I can't keep the conversation going...
Why do I feel so uncomfortable in my own house?
％Ｂ
「Uhh... Umm... Oh yeah, so they were talking about how you were looking for me?」
％Ｂ
「You came to my classroom and wandered around in front of the committee office, right? Were you that lonely without me...? ...Just kidding, haha─」


Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「Oh...」
I was just joking around, but I didn't expect her to respond like that.
The mood in my room gets even heavier. Or I guess that's just me. I have no idea what to say next.

Sora
「...You've always been with me
, Ryou

.」
％Ｂ
「Hm?」
Sora
「...When I'm stargazing on the roof, or when I'm borrowing books from the library, or when I'm reading books, or when I turned in the request forms to stay late, or when I was stargazing at night... You were always there with me.」


Sora
「...It became natural to do things with you. That's why it felt strange when you didn't come yesterday... Looking through the telescope by myself felt lonely...」








％Ｂ
「Really...」
Sora
「...It was normal for me to be alone while stargazing until a little while ago. It's strange...」

She tilts her head.
She seems genuinely confused.
％Ｂ
「W-Well, either way, I'll be at school tomorrow. Let's stargaze together again.」

Sora
「...*nod*」
She nods and smiles happily.
Sora
「...Hungry?」
％Ｂ
「Huh? Oh... Yeah, I guess so.」
Now that she mentions it, I was just about to get ready to make dinner before everyone showed up.

Sora
「...I'll make food then.」
％Ｂ
「Wha... You will?」
Sora
「...I brought ingredients before coming here. I left them in the kitchen.」

％Ｂ
「Oh, really?」
Sora
「...Mari told me. You live alone, so you need to eat properly.」




Sora
「She said you'd feel better right away if you ate my cooking.」

Sora
「...But you're already feeling better.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, well uh... A-Actually, I think I might still have a bit of a fever... Mmmhm, I still feel kinda heavy too... Kaff, cough.」

Sora
「...You don't have to put on an act. I'll still make food.」
％Ｂ
「My bad...」
Sora
「...Will you eat it?」
％Ｂ
「I'd love to!」
The two of us go down to the kitchen.
％Ｂ
「What are you gonna make?」
Sora
「...Seasoned rice porridge. It's good to have something easily digestible when you're sick.」
％Ｂ
「Rice porridge. Sounds good.」
Sora
「...The recovery phase is important for getting over colds.」
Ousaka places the ingredients into the pot.
Her movements seem pretty practiced.
％Ｂ
「Oh... But I don't have any rice for you to make porridge with.」
Sora
「...I bought some.」
She pulls out some ready-made rice from her grocery bag.
％Ｂ
「Ohh... You've got everything covered.」
Sora
「...Mhmh.」
all
She puts the rice in the microwave and watches the pot as she waits.
I just sit in a chair and watch her.
The girl I like's over at my house, making food for me...

What a wonderful sight.
Sora
「...」
Her cheeks suddenly go red.
％Ｂ
「...Hm?」
Sora
「...It's kind of embarrassing when you stare.」
％Ｂ
「O-Oh... Sorry, I was just so happy.」
Sora
「...Happy?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, I'm happy. There's a girl making food for me. Of course I'm happy.」


And what's more, it's the girl I've fallen for.
Though I'd probably end up putting Ousaka under some weird pressure if I said that, so let's not.

Sora
「...Really. You can watch, then.」
％Ｂ
「Okay. Thanks.」
I've gotten her permission, so I openly watch her the whole time until the food is done.

all
％Ｂ
「Fhhh, fhhh... Hamh... hofh, hofh... Mgmgh...」
Sora
「...」
I'm eating the completed rice porridge. This time, it's Ousaka's turn to stare at me.
％Ｂ
「Gulp... Ahh.」
Sora
「...How is it?」
％Ｂ
「Mhm... It's great!」
She looks relieved.
％Ｂ
「This porridge has a nice smell. What is it?」
Sora
「...It has a little yuzu in it. Goes well with the bonito stock.」
％Ｂ
「Really, yuzu. Yeah, it definitely works!」
Ousaka's rice porridge is flavored lightly, out of consideration for my still-recovering body.

The fragrance of yuzu stirs my appetite.
It's a very gentle rice porridge.
％Ｂ
「Hamh... mgmgh... Chomp... hofh, hofh... Hot, hot... mgmgh...」
Sora
「...There's lots more, so no need to rush. Eat slowly.」

％Ｂ
「Gulp... I wanna eat slow... but I can't help it, it's seriously amazing... Ngh, ngh...」

I'm already done with my first bowl.
％Ｂ
「Pfah... Seconds!」
Sora
「...You don't have to rush...」
But she still hands me a second serving right away.
％Ｂ
「Hamh... Hot, hot... hofh...」
Sora
「...Hehe...」
Ousaka watches me happily as I start on my second bowl.
