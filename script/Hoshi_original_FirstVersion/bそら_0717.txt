Shuuichi
「Tomorrow's the closing ceremony.」
％Ｂ
「...Why bring that up?」
Natsuki
「We knew that already.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
Shuuichi
「No... I'm saying this is going to be our last meeting for the first semester.」

％Ｂ
「Oh, that's what you meant.」
Touko
「So what, then?」
Shuuichi
「We'll have to buckle down for preparing for the Tanabata Festival starting tomorrow. But we don't have a plan for that yet.」

％Ｂ
「We already told you, Sora and I are gonna get jobs and the others are gonna gather up cardboard―」

Shuuichi
「It's too vague. You haven't decided on anything specific, like when you're going to start your jobs, when you need the cardboard by, or when you're planning on finishing the dome.」


all
Natsuki
「You're so picky... Picky guys aren't popular with the ladies, Nirasawa.」
Shuuichi
「I don't need anyone other than Kaori-san! I mean, that's not what's important here! You guys are gonna be the ones in trouble later if you don't nail down the specifics a little more for your plan!」


％Ｂ
「Shuuichi's got a point. There's a chance we'll misjudge timings and end up not being able to finish by the festival if we don't plan things out a little more.」


all
Rikka
「You two are starting your jobs once we're in summer break, right?」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, pretty much.」
Rikka
「We'll need Ousaka-san there to make the parts, which I think would mean that we would only be able to start building the dome once you're done working.」


Marika
「We'll need to get the cardboard together by then～」
％Ｂ
「So what you're saying is the first thing we need to do is to figure out our jobs.」
all
Shuuichi
「Have you decided on what you're going to be doing?」
％Ｂ
「No, not yet.」
Shuuichi
「Come on... I thought I told you we don't have the time to just sit around doing nothing.」
％Ｂ
「I know. But we can't really find jobs that fit the conditions we want...」

Shuuichi
「It'll be over in a snap if you just work as a mover or some other kinda manual labor.」

％Ｂ
「I'd be fine with that if it were just me, but...」
Sora
「...I want to work with him.」
Shuuichi
「Uh...ghh... Regardless, figure out when and how long you're going to be working. You won't be able to start on building the dome until you do.」


all
％Ｂ
「You're right. Let's say we'll start building the dome on the 28th, the second week of summer break, then. We'll make sure we're finished with our jobs by then.」


％Ｂ
「If we don't end up getting the money together by then, Sora can stop working and be there for the construction. I'll earn the rest on my own.」


％Ｂ
「So we'll need the necessary amount of cardboard by the 28th. Maybe you guys could start doing that as soon as break starts.」

％Ｂ
「How's that sound?」
Shuuichi
「...I guess that's fine. And by the way, is the dome really going to be done in time if you start on the 28th, Ousaka?」

all
Sora
「...No issues.」
Natsuki
「It'll be fine if Sora says so.」
all
Shuuichi
「Okay. I'll believe that too for now, then. Just make sure you're finished in time, all right?」


Shuuichi
「We have to start placing orders with printing companies for pamphlets for the festival.」

Shuuichi
「We wouldn't want guests to come for the planetarium after seeing the pamphlet and have to tell them, "Sorry, but we didn't finish the planetarium in time for the festival."」


％Ｂ
「I know. We'll complete it for sure.」
all
Misa
「Now then, what shall we do for the rest of today?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, so today we're going to make the tem―」
Natsuki
「We're off today, obviously!」
all
％Ｂ
「Huh...?」
Natsuki
「If we're gonna have to buckle down for preparations starting tomorrow, then of course we're going to be off for today!」

％Ｂ
「No, we were planning on making templates today―」
Natsuki
「It's a kickoff party! We'll have a kickoff party to build up solidarity! Specifically, well...! We'll go camping!」


％Ｂ
「Wha... Don't be ridiculous! How are we gonna go camping right now!?」

Misa
「I believe camping may be out of the question, but I do believe doing something together will build solidarity.」

Marika
「We'll be busy starting tomorrow, so it might be nice to take a break for today and do something else like Segawa-san says.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, but the templates―」
Rikka
「What are we going to do? We're not going to play the line-up game again, are we?」

Natsuki
「I need to go buy some super-spicy rice crackers!」
％Ｂ
「No way! Those cause damage that's invisible to the eye! I'm talking next-day stuff!」

Sora smoothly raises her hand while we're all fussing about.
all
Sora
「...Let's watch the stars.」
％Ｂ
「You too, Sora!?」
Sora
「...I want everyone else to look through the telescope too. I want them to learn about the stars so we can make the planetarium.」

Marika
「Oh, I want to see! I've always wanted to look through an astronomical telescope～」

Natsuki
「I'm definitely interested in things that have lenses, as someone who uses a camera.」

all
Misa
「I have also never looked through a telescope. I would love to experience it.」

Rikka
「...I wouldn't say I'm not interested.」
Touko
「Mmm... I think I might wanna see too.」
Shuuichi
「...Can I come too?」
％Ｂ
「You too!?」
all
Sora
「...*nod*」
Sora
「...I want everyone to see.」
Well, I guess we can start making the templates tomorrow.
I'll defer to what Sora herself wants to do.
Sora used to say that looking at the stars was enough to make her happy, but now she's saying she wants to do it with everyone.

Those feelings are important.
all
Shuuichi
「Whoa!? This is the moon!? Like, the moon we always see!? The moon's this big, at this time of day!? Astronomical telescopes are awesooooome!」


％Ｂ
「...It's like I'm watching myself from a little while ago.」

Natsuki
「Come on, Nirasawa! Stop monopolizing it! Trade places already!」

Shuuichi
「Wait a second! Just a little longer!」
Marika
「I want to see toooo～」
all
Touko
「Hey Fluffyhead, what's that star that's shining there?」

Sora
「...It's the Evening Star. Venus.」
Touko
「Can we see that through the telescope too?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
Touko
「I wanna see that, then! Show me that!」
Rikka
「Wait, you have to go in order. My turn's next.」
％Ｂ
「Even you, Narusawa...?」
I didn't know everyone had been so interested in the astronomical telescope.
all
Misa
「Speaking of which, I have heard before that it is possible to see the International Space Station.」

％Ｂ
「Oh, she showed me that the other day, actually.」
Sora
「...It'll be passing through the northern skies soon.」
Shuuichi
「Seriously!? Show me, Ousaka! Where is it? Which way do I look!?」

all
Natsuki
「Aghhh! He changed the angle!」
Marika
「But I still haven't seen the moon～!」
％Ｂ
「Oh my god... What are you, kids?」
all
Sora
「...Everyone's having fun.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. I can understand. I remember I was crazy excited the first time you showed me.」

Sora
「...I should've shown them sooner.」
％Ｂ
「...You can just show them lots from now on.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
Sora looks happy as she watches everyone argue over the telescope.

To me, it seems like she's smiling because her dream of communicating the wonder of stars came true a little this way.
