Misa
「There, over there!」
Misa-senpai pulls me by the hand through the crowd.
There's a warm light throughout the area, and it's bustling with people.

％Ｂ
「You'll ruin your yukata if you run too much.」
Misa
「It's fine, I pulled the sash tight!」
％Ｂ
「Are you sure?」
Misa
「Yes, I'm sure it will probably be fine.」
％Ｂ
「Then let's hurry, just a bit!」
Misa
「Yes!」
The city is decorated with vivid Tanabata decorations.
There are big pieces of bamboo attached to the streetlights, with variously colored decorations hanging from there.

She's watching them excitedly as she walks in front of me.

Misa
「They're wonderful!」
％Ｂ
「Yes, they are. Everything's so pretty. The decorations, the stalls, and...」

I glance at her.
％Ｂ
「You're pretty too, Misa-senpai.」
Misa
「Thank you very much! Ufufu... You saying that makes me happy.」

％Ｂ
「It's from the bottom of my heart. You look incredible in your yukata.」

Misa
「I'm very relieved. I actually haven't worn a yukata since I was a child, so I was worried that it wouldn't look good on me...」


％Ｂ
「What are you saying? It looks perfect on you. The goldfish design is very much like you.」

Misa
「I obtained it especially for today! I fell in love with this yukata at first sight.」

Misa
「As far as I can tell, I believe these goldfish to be of the comet species.」

％Ｂ
「Comet? That doesn't really sound like a goldfish.」
Misa
「It's a goldfish from America. Its name comes from its long, comet-like tail. It just seemed significant to me.」


％Ｂ
「I see, because it's connected to both stars and fish?」

Misa
「Yes! I thought it was perfect after the "sea full of stars." They're very cute～」

％Ｂ
「Oh, you'll twist up your yukata if you spin around too much.」
Misa
「Oh! ...Y-Yes, you're right. I'm not very used to wearing this...」

％Ｂ
「But if it's been that long since you've worn one... does that mean you don't really go to festivals?」

Misa
「No, I don't. There was a Tanabata event at the aquarium around this time of year, so I usually prioritized that...」


％Ｂ
「I see. That does sound like you.」
She must've been obsessed with the aquarium.
％Ｂ
「I haven't been here since I was a kid either. It's all very new to me.」
Misa
「Ufufu, then we're both the same. I'm happy that we can both experience this festival the same way.」

％Ｂ
「Let's enjoy ourselves today.」
Misa
「Yes!」
She jumps with joy.
Her geta clatter on the ground.
％Ｂ
「Misa-senpai, that jump messed up your yukata...」
Misa
「A-Ahh!? Wh-What should I do...?」

％Ｂ
「I'll fix it. I'm sure it should be okay if I just tuck it in.」

I grab the hem and straighten it out.
Misa
「I'm sorry. I should be more ladylike.」

％Ｂ
「It's fine. It's more like you to be jumping up and down. I can fix your yukata if it gets a little messy.」


Misa
「Ufufu... Thank you very much.」
％Ｂ
「Okay then, I'm going to pull a bit here.」
Misa
「O-Okay... Oh, b-but...」
％Ｂ
「Is something wrong?」
Misa
「I think you may, um, be touching... my boobs... a bit...」

％Ｂ
「Huh? A-Agh! I-I'm sorry! It felt different from usual, so I didn't notice...」

Misa
「Y-Yes... I'm wearing a cotton wrap right now. My boobs are larger than most, so... I guess you could say I'm holding them in...」


％Ｂ
「I-I see. So that's why it felt firmer than usual...」
I actually can't really feel them through her yukata.
So they must be squished down tight.
Those boobs of hers that are usually so astonishingly soft...
Misa
「...You're making a bit of a perverted face.」
％Ｂ
「Wh-What!?」
Misa
「Ufufufufu, it seems I'm correct. You were imagining something strange, weren't you?」

％Ｂ
「N-No, I wasn't! I wasn't doing anything of the sort!」

Misa
「Is that true～? You occasionally become very perverted.」
％Ｂ
「I'm focused on fixing your yukata for the moment, at least. I may end up touching you a bit more, but please bear it. Here goes...!」


Misa
「A-Aaah～!?」
She lets out a strange yell.
I empty myself of emotion and fix the area around her chest.
％Ｂ
「Okay, there we go.」
Misa
「Hahh... Yes, it's done perfectly... and what's more, I didn't sense any perversion...」

％Ｂ
「Of course. I'm a very serious man.」
％Ｂ
「Though, well... I do get perverted sometimes. But I can keep myself in check.」

Misa
「...Would it be because my boobs are squeezed down tight?」
％Ｂ
「W-Well, there's that, too. Boobs are nice because they're soft.」

Misa
「I see, I see... That's true... I would also like... you to touch them when they're soft.」

She speaks in a vanishingly soft voice.
She squeezes my hand tight.
Misa
「A-Aahhh!?」
％Ｂ
「Wha? What is it?」
Misa
「Please look! Taiyaki!」
She points toward a stall.
Misa
「Let's eat taiyaki together!」
％Ｂ
「Of course! It's one of the things we're here for. It seems like there are many different types.」

Misa
「You're right! White bean paste, sweet potato paste, custard...」

％Ｂ
「Which are you going to get?」
Misa
「The plain one, perhaps? Oh, but... sweet potato sounds wonderful too...」

Misa
「But! The fundamentals must be treasured!」
Misa
「It's very good～」
She's in ecstasy from the taiyaki.
％Ｂ
「You're about to drip some drool.」
Misa
「W-Wawah... I apologize. I should close my lips tight.」

Misa
「But the taiyaki is very delicious.」
She happily bites the head.
Watching her enjoy herself makes me happy.
Misa
「But I still feel like I may have wanted to try the sweet potato...」
She looks a bit regretful.
％Ｂ
「I thought you might say that. So I got the sweet potato one. Would you like to split it?」

Misa
「How wonderful!」
Misa
「Oh, b-but～」
％Ｂ
「Is something wrong?」
Misa
「Usually, when you feed me... it ends with you doing dirty things to me.」

％Ｂ
「Uh... You have a point, but...」
％Ｂ
「But that won't happen this time!」
Misa
「Are you sure～?」
％Ｂ
「Yes, it's like I told you before.」
Misa
「Then... Aahh...」
％Ｂ
「"Ahhh"...」
Misa
「Hamh, hamh... Nmh... Oh, it's very good.」

Misa
「But you fed me normally...」
％Ｂ
「I told you I was serious.」
Misa
「Hmm... It feels somewhat lacking, actually...」
Misa
「Oh, well then, it is time to return the favor. Please, enjoy this red bean paste taiyaki!」

％Ｂ
「Yes, I'd love to have some.」
Misa
「Say "ahhh"!」
％Ｂ
「Ahhh... Nmh.」
Misa
「Oh, I'm so sorry～ I got some on your cheek.」
％Ｂ
「N-No, it's okay.」
That felt a little contrived just now...
Misa
「I'll remove that... Wait, is that...?」
％Ｂ
「Ohhh, whoa!?」
We walk by a large crowd of people around an enormous stage.

Misa
「It's the clockwork Tanabata!」
％Ｂ
「Clockwork Tanabata? What's that?」
Misa
「There are dancing spinning-reel dolls to celebrate Tanabata! They apparently don't make them much nowadays, but they're very cute.」


％Ｂ
「Wow, now that's amazing.」
The clockwork dolls are moving like they're really alive.
I wonder what the mechanisms are like inside that stage?
And then...
Misa
「Mmm, chu!」
％Ｂ
「Wah!」
Misa
「Ufufufu, you still had red bean paste on your cheek, you know.」
％Ｂ
「I-I didn't think you'd be the one to kiss me...」
Misa
「Mmm, it is rather unfamiliar. I'm not particularly aggressive, so...」

Misa
「Perhaps the fish ate it instead!」
％Ｂ
「I think I could believe it, if you're the one saying so.」
Misa
「Yes! I'm sure of it!」
Misa
「Oh, look! Superball scooping!」
She points at another stall.
％Ｂ
「Ohh, that looks fun. Let's do it!」
Misa
「Ufufu, I didn't think I would be able to get quite this many♪」
She looks at the pile of superballs she managed to fish up.
％Ｂ
「I completely failed...」
I was pretty confident, too.
I might just not measure up to Misa-senpai when it comes to collecting things out of water.

Misa
「It may have been a good thing that I was wearing a yukata for that.」
％Ｂ
「Is that so?」
Misa
「Yes, well... because I'm wearing the cotton wrap. I usually can't see downward very much...」

％Ｂ
「Ah...」
Because she's got a big chest.
They must obstruct her vision.
Though I bet it's a problem that some people would love to have.
Misa
「But I can't make you happy with them when they're squished down like this, Ryousuke-san. It seems there are upsides and downsides♪」


Misa
「But I can't make you happy with them when they're squished down like this. It seems there are upsides and downsides♪」


She whispers to me.
My heart starts thumping away.
％Ｂ
「But I love it when you're serious too.」
Misa
「D-Do you?」
％Ｂ
「Yes, you're very pretty when you're trying your hardest... It's captivating.」

Misa
「O-Oh my, captivating... Ufufufu...」

％Ｂ
「I love you.」
Misa
「Kyaaah... I'm so happy! How wonderful!」
％Ｂ
「Wait, Misa-senpai. I'm glad you're happy, but if you swing the superballs around like that...」


Misa
「What? ...O-Oh!」
She's swinging the plastic bag full of rubber balls around all over the place in her excitement.\n\r

And of course, the bag goes flying out of her hand.
Misa
「W-Wah～ Please wait～」
％Ｂ
「Let's split up and gather them!」
Misa
「Y-Yesss!」
We immediately start running around all over the place.
Misa
「I apologize. I wasn't thinking...」
It just happened to be a quiet street, so we found all of the superballs after a brief search.

Misa
「One, two, three... Ufufu, we found all of them. I'm glad we didn't lose any of them.」


％Ｂ
「Though it's not like superballs have that much value...」

Misa
「That's not true. These superballs are very valuable.」
Misa
「They're the superballs that the two of us got together. I'd very much like to treasure them.」

％Ｂ
「Misa-senpai... So that's why you wanted to find all of them so badly.」
Misa
「I ended up moving around quite a bit in this yukata... It's become quite disheveled...」

％Ｂ
「There's no helping that. I wonder if I'd be able to patch that up... I feel like we should undo the sash first...」


Misa
「Auh... Y-Yes, perhaps we should...」
％Ｂ
「Is there somewhere we could fix it? Oh, that's...」
Misa
「Oh my... That is...」
Our eyes fall on a certain building.
...It's what you'd call a love hotel.
％Ｂ
「Uhh... I think we could fix your yukata in there. You could take it off, and...」

Misa
「Y-Yes, you're right. We wouldn't... have to worry about other people seeing us in there.」

She smiles ticklishly.
...She seems a bit excited.
e美砂_9006エッチシーン6
We return to the festival after fixing her yukata.
We head toward the riverbank, for the festival's closing fireworks display.
Misa
「...I received some very happy news recently.」
She suddenly speaks up as we're walking.
％Ｂ
「Happy news?」
Misa
「Yes, I just had to tell you... but no opportunity presented itself, so...」

Misa
「Two underclassmen spoke to me during the school's Tanabata Festival, and told me they were very moved by the "sea full of stars."」

Misa
「...They told me they would like to join the naturalist club.」
％Ｂ
「What!? You got new members?」
Misa
「They are apparently going to try a trial period of being in the club after the summer break ends.」
％Ｂ
「Tha...That's great!」
％Ｂ
「Your passion got through to them! That's honestly so great!」

％Ｂ
「Really now... New members for the naturalist club...」
Misa
「Y-You're overreacting! You don't need to tear up...」

％Ｂ
「No, I'm seriously happy for you!」
Misa
「I'm... very happy too.」
％Ｂ
「It's like that lady from the municipal legislative assembly said. If you keep working hard, then your wish will definitely come true...」


Misa
「Yes... I felt that way too. That as long as I do my best and believe in myself, I would definitely achieve the results I wish for. So I will hesitate no more.」


％Ｂ
「...What?」
Misa
「I was depressed this whole time, until you came to our school, Ryousuke-san.」

Misa
「I was depressed this whole time, until you came to our school.」

Misa
「I had been acting optimistic as usual... but I could not remove the pain of Marinpia's closure from within my heart.」


Misa
「It felt like the things that I like, that I love, had been rejected. It felt to me as if my own future itself had been rejected.」

Misa
「But I came to learn many important things in the time that I have spent together with you, Ryousuke-san.」

Misa
「But I came to learn many important things in the time that I have spent together with you.」

Misa
「To believe in myself. To believe in my friends. And... to believe in possibilities.」

Misa
「I would like to study much more and communicate the wonders of the ocean, and of nature, to many people... I wish to share this wonderful thought with everyone.」


Misa
「I will no longer hesitate in pursuing that dream.」
％Ｂ
「Misa-senpai...」
I step next to her and gently take her hand.
％Ｂ
「Then I'll support you. I'll watch over you.」

％Ｂ
「I'll always be by your side, and always be there when you can't take it anymore, and need someone to lean on.」

Misa
「I'm so happy... And I will also become someone who can support your dreams, Ryousuke-san.」


Misa
「I'm so happy... And I will also become someone who can support your dreams.」


Misa
「So from now on...」
％Ｂ
「Yes. We'll always be together.」
Misa
「Yes!」
A firework cuts through the darkness of the night.
It illuminates the sky.
Misa
「Woooow! How wonderful...!」
Misa
「It's a fish!」
It's a big, fish-shaped firework.
％Ｂ
「It's the perfect firework for you. Look, here come more!」

％Ｂ
「Fiiirewooorks!」
Misa
「Fiiishwooorks!」
The two of us hop in the air and shout.
And once we come back down to the ground...
It feels like we've moved just a bit into the future.
