The next morning.
We're eating breakfast with the TV on.
Natsuki
「Want another slice of toast?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, thanks.」
all
Announcer
『And so, we had newscaster Morishita go to Shionagi's beach after it opened the previous day. Please enjoy this footage.』


％Ｂ
「Hm... Shionagi's beach?」
Something the voice on the TV said catches my interest, and I turn to look.

Interviewer
『Here I am, at Shionagi's beach. It is currently the 20th, which means the beach was opened to the public just yesterday～』

％Ｂ
「Wait a second... This is... Hey, Natsuki!」
Natsuki
「Hm? Want two slices instead?」
％Ｂ
「Not the toast! Look at the TV for a second.」
Natsuki
「Hmm? Oh, is this the thing from yesterday? I wonder if we're going to appear on TV.」

％Ｂ
「No idea. There were a lot of people getting interviewed, so we might've been cut―」

Natsuki
「Ahhhh!」
％Ｂ
「Wh-What!?」
Natsuki points at the screen.
all
Interviewer
『Oh, then let's speak with that couple over there next! Excuse me～ May I take a moment of your time～?』

％Ｂ
「...We weren't cut.」
There we are. Natsuki and I are up on TV.
Natsuki
「Wh-What are we going to do!? We're on TV!」

％Ｂ
「Y-Yeah... Though it's not like we can do anything about it now.」
all
Interviewer
『May I ask you a few questions? Where are the two of you from?』

％Ｂ
『Uhh... We're locals. We're both from Shionagi.』
Natsuki
「What the heck, what are you acting like that for?」
％Ｂ
「I just answered normally...」
Interviewer
『Oh, you're locals. Which would mean the two of you are here on a day off? Are you on a date, perhaps～?』


％Ｂ
『W-Well... Yes...』
Natsuki
『It's a date!』
Natsuki
「Agh, I just shouted over you like that!? This is crazy embarrassing!」

％Ｂ
「You're only realizing that now...?」
Natsuki
「What kinda questions did we get again?」
％Ｂ
「What do you mean? ...I'm pretty sure the next one's―」
Interviewer
『A beach date right after it's opened! How very nice～ What is your relationship? I assume you're dating?』


Ryousuke・Natsuki
％Ｂ
『No, we're married.』
Natsuki
『No, we're married.』
％Ｂ・Natsuki
％Ｂ
『No, we're married.』
Natsuki
『No, we're married.』
Natsuki
「What the heck was that just now!? We totally answered in sync!」
％Ｂ
「You already knew we did that...」
Interviewer
『Oh really～ Oh my～ You two must get along very well to match up that perfectly～』


％Ｂ
『W-Well... Yes, we do... Haha...』
Natsuki
『Ehehe...』
Our faces on screen are flushed as we smile awkwardly.
％Ｂ
「Th-This... is pretty embarrassing...」
Seeing us on TV like this is several times more embarrassing than it was during the actual interview.


Natsuki
「We're a total idiot couple, aren't we...」
％Ｂ
「Yeah...」
Natsuki
「Who's calling this early in the morning? ...Yes, hello? Oh, Mom? Wha... You were watching that!? O-Oh, really... Oh, well, yeah... Just by coincidence, when we went to the beach, yeah... Mhm...」


Natsuki's mom apparently saw the interview.
Natsuki
「Huh? Lovey-dovey? Geez, don't call just to say stuff like that!」

This isn't good... I'm definitely going to get made fun of if anyone I know saw that.

It's a local broadcast, so I don't think too many people will have seen it...

all
Azuma
「Hey, I saw you on TV this morning! A beach date with your wife on your day off, eh? Looks like you're taking good care of her!」

God... dammit...
Someone saw it...
And it's someone from work, of all things...
％Ｂ
「Well, uh...」
Firm Staff B
「Chief, I don't know if that was the best way to phrase that.」
Firm Staff A
「But we sure got a good look at how lovey-dovey you two are～」
Azuma
「I'm glad to see your private life's going well. You're a real impressive specimen of a man, you know that? I'm so jealous!」


％Ｂ
「...Thank you very much.」
I'm gonna have to put up with this for a while, aren't I...?
all
％Ｂ
「Oh, I'll get it.」
％Ｂ
「Yes, this is the Azuma Architectural Firm. Oh, Nishioka-sensei.」
It's Nishioka-sensei, the photographer Natsuki works under.

％Ｂ
「If you'd like to speak to Chief... What? You don't? You want to speak to me? Yes, what would you like to speak about?」

％Ｂ
「...About what you saw on TV... this morning... Well, um... Perhaps we could speak about that on another occasion... What?」

％Ｂ
「Lovey-dovey... Excuse me, but could you not call the firm just to say things like this?」

I bet Natsuki's getting teased a lot too, from the looks of things...
