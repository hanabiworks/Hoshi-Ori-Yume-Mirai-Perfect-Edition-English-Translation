Yamashita-sensei
「Astronomy club... Club activity extension request, until 8 p.m... Approved.」
％Ｂ
「Thank you very much!」
Sora
「...very much.」
The extracurricular adviser's given us approval to stay until 8 p.m. again today.

％Ｂ
「There we... go.」
We finish setting up the telescope. We're ready to stargaze.

％Ｂ
「The weather's looking good too. It's a perfect day for stargazing.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「...」
Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「That wasn't me.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
Oh, she just acknowledged it.
％Ｂ
「You hungry? You're not gonna make it until eight like that. Want me to go buy something?」

Sora
「...*shake shake*」
％Ｂ
「Hm?」
all
Ousaka pulls out a smallish drawstring pouch from her bag.
Sora
「...We had cooking class today.」
％Ｂ
「Huh, so you've already got a snack ready for when you're a little hungry. What'd you make?」

Sora
「...Mm.」
She hands me the pouch.
％Ｂ
「It smells sweet... Are these cookies?」
Sora
「...I made enough for you too
, Ryou

.」
％Ｂ
「Wha, seriously? Awesome!」
I yell out from sincere happiness.
I hold in my excitement and look inside.
％Ｂ
「Oh, star-shaped cookies! That's just like you.」
Ousaka made cookies for me.
Or specifically, she made enough for me, so it's her own share plus my own. But that's still fine!

Ousaka made enough cookies for me too.
That makes me incredibly happy!
This is pretty much treasure to me right now!
％Ｂ
「Can I eat some?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「Let's try one, then.」
all
I take one of the cookies and toss it in my mouth.
％Ｂ
「Hamh... ngngh... Gulp. Mhm, it's great!」
There's just the right amount of sweetness. It just crumbles away in my mouth, but there's still a definite crunch to it.

％Ｂ
「These are great. Great job!」
Sora
「...Faithful to the recipe.」
She proudly sticks her thumb up at me.
Sora
「...Also, the one you ate just now was Sirius.


.」
％Ｂ
「Uh... Sirius?」
Sora
「...This is Antares, this one's Rigel, and these are Capella, Syrma, Mimosa.」

So they've all been given the names of stars...
It's a level of attention to detail that's just what I'd expect of Ousaka.
％Ｂ
「Wait a second, is that why they're all slightly different sizes?」
Sora
「...All handmade. I shaped each of them by hand... They're definitely not like that by mistake.」

％Ｂ
「...That's pretty detailed... So what's this star?」
I point at the biggest one.
Sora
「...Betelgeuse.」
％Ｂ
「Betelgeuse... I've heard of that one.」
Sora
「...Also known as the "Heike Star." Part of the constellation Orion. Betelgeuse, Sirius in Canis Major, and Procyon in Canis Minor form the Winter Triangle.」


％Ｂ
「Oh yeah, there's a triangle for the winter too. But I don't think I knew the names of the stars.」

Sora
「...I'll give this to you
, Ryou

.」
She picks up Betelgeuse and holds it up to my mouth.

％Ｂ
「Uh... Um...」
Sora
「...Say "ahh."」
％Ｂ
「Uh... Ahh... Hamh...」
Her fingers made contact with my lips for an instant as I closed my mouth.
Sora
「...How is it?」
％Ｂ
「Mh... Mhm... mgh...」
I have no idea how it tastes. I'm too nervous to tell.

'Cause come on. It's a "say 'ahh'" we're talking about here. Right?
And I even ended up licking her fingers a bit on top of that...
Sora
「...Mlh.」
％Ｂ
「Ngh...!?」
Ousaka sticks out her tongue and licks away the cookie crumbs on her hand.

Sora
「...What?」
％Ｂ
「No... Nothing...」
all
I need to calm down.
We've already had a few indirect kisses.
There was the yakisoba bread, the thing with the burger pickles...
Why am I so nervous about it today, then...?
％Ｂ
「I'm gonna go buy some drinks. What do you want?」
Sora
「Plum soda.」
％Ｂ
「Got it. Wait just a minute, then.」
all
I hand the pouch of cookies to Ousaka and leave the rooftop.
I need to cool my head... or no, more like I need to cool my face off...
It's gotten dark enough that I can see a lot of stars even without the telescope.
Sora
「...Scutum, the Shield, is next to Aquila's left wing.」
％Ｂ
「Shield? As in, the thing you defend yourself with?」
Sora
「...Yes. Its brightest star is only a fourth-magnitude star, so it's a little hard to find with the naked eye.」

％Ｂ
「Hmm... Can't see it.」
Sora
「...There's a long pentagon of stars to its right. That's Ophiuchus, the Serpent-Bearer.」

％Ｂ
「I know Ophiuchus. It's included in the zodiac sometimes for horoscopes, right?」

Sora
「...*nod* The serpent that the serpent-bearer's grabbing is Serpens.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, it's connected to another constellation?」
Sora
「...Can you see the red star at Ophiuchus's feet?」
％Ｂ
「Hmm... Yeah, I can see it.」
Sora
「...That's Antares, in Scorpio.」
％Ｂ
「Antares is... this cookie, right?」
Sora
「...That one's Rigel. This one's Antares.」
％Ｂ
「My bad... I couldn't tell 'cause they're the same color.」
Sora
「...You got it wrong, so I'm eating Antares.」
Ousaka grabs Antares and throws it in her mouth.
We've been occasionally grabbing cookies and eating them like this as Ousaka talks to me about the stars.

％Ｂ
「Phew...」
Sora
「...Is your neck tired?」
％Ｂ
「Uh... No, I'm still fine for now.」
Sora
「...Really.」
Huh...?
Is it me, or does she look a little bit disappointed?
Yeah, right... But...
％Ｂ
「U-Uhh... You know, I think my neck might hurt after all.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
She nods and immediately kneels on the ground. She pats her thighs.

％Ｂ
「...You sure?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「A-All right then, excuse me...」
I'm going to be stargazing while Ousaka gives me a lap pillow again today.
I listen to her talk about the constellations as I feel her warmth directly on the back of my head.

Sora
「...Corona Borealis, the Crown, is above Serpens's head. The brightest star in Corona Borealis is Alphecca, a second-magnitude star.」

％Ｂ
「...」
I look up at the night sky as I listen to her talk.
Sora
「...There's also a Southern Crown, Corona Australis. Corona Australis can only be seen low in the southern sky from Japan.」


％Ｂ
「...」
The deep, starry sky expands out into forever before me.
Multitudes of stars glimmer in the darkness.
And once again, there's a light just as pretty as those stars so close to me─
In Ousaka's eyes.
Sora
「...So we can't see Corona Australis from here right now... What's wrong?」
She peers at my face.
％Ｂ
「...」
Sora
「...
Ryou

?」
％Ｂ
「...People would get the wrong idea if they saw us like this, wouldn't they?」
Sora
「...The wrong idea?」
％Ｂ
「We look like lovers doing this, don't we?」
Sora
「...I can't deny that possibility.」
％Ｂ
「That'd bother you, right? Like you wouldn't know what to say.」
Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「Ousaka...?」
Sora
「...I wouldn't know... what to say about not knowing what to say.」
％Ｂ
「...?」
I wonder what she means by that.
She wouldn't know what to say about not knowing what to say... As in, she's bothered by the fact that she wouldn't know what to say...?
So does that mean it'd be better for her if she didn't have to feel that way?
But─
It seemed like Ousaka looked a little happy when I said we looked like lovers.

Argh, I can't...
I wanted to hold myself back, but I can't...
％Ｂ
「Ousaka...」
I lift my hand and place it against her cheek.
Sora
「...」
Ousaka doesn't show any sign of disliking it, and she doesn't try to pull away.
％Ｂ
「I like you, Ousaka.」
Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「If you're okay with it... Would you go out with me?」
Sora
「...」
Ousaka's silent.
Her expression isn't telling me she wants to decline, but she isn't nodding either.

She just looks at me silently.
％Ｂ
「...Sorry. You don't know what to say to that, right? But I wanted to tell you.」
Sora
「...*shake shake*」
She slowly shakes her head.
Sora
「...It's not like that... but it is.」
％Ｂ
「...What's that mean?」
Sora
「...I don't really know myself. I don't know what to say about how I don't know how to respond to you...



」
％Ｂ
「So that's... not a no?」
Sora
「...I want to think a little...」
Her words make my heart shiver.
I hurriedly sit up from Ousaka's lap pillow.
I kneel on the ground like she's doing, facing her and looking her directly in the eyes.

％Ｂ
「Yeah! I'll wait! I'll be waiting for your response!」
Sora
「...*nod*」
To be honest, I was convinced that she was going to reject me. This reaction from her's a happy surprise.

After all, she told me just yesterday that she didn't have any intentions of forming a special relationship with anyone at the moment.

And I was worried about that "first love" of hers for sure too.
But there were the lap pillow and the cookies, so I definitely had some hope too.

％Ｂ
「Once you think about it... If you come to a conclusion, then...!」
Sora
「...I'll give you my answer.」
％Ｂ
「Y-Yeah! I'll be waiting!」
I bow my head to her without thinking.
Sora
「...Hehe.」
I hear a little laugh from her above my head.
I lift my head. She's smiling.
And she's blushing just a bit.
I smile back at her.
It may be just a tiny bit, but I feel like I've gotten closer to her.
