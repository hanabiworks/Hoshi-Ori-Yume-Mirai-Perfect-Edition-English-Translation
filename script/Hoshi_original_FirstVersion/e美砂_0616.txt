「Oh, Ousaka.」
Sora
「...」
I call out to Ousaka when I see her at the school gates.
％Ｂ
「Morning.」
Sora
「...Mm.」
％Ｂ
「Thanks for hanging out with us on Saturday. That planetarium you took us to was awesome!」


Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「Those sea fireflies that Okihara-senpai showed us were awesome too, right!?」

Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「I looked it up on the internet, and it looks like home-use planetariums are pretty advanced these days. It'd be great if we could use stuff like that to get something similar to the one we went to.」


Sora
「...」
Ousaka's as quiet as ever.
But something seems a little different from usual.
It's not that she's consciously ignoring what I'm saying. It looks more like she's thinking about something.

％Ｂ
「Talk to you later, then.」
Sora
「...
Ryou
Mm
.」
％Ｂ
「Hm? What's up?」
Sora
「...I want to talk after school.」
％Ｂ
「You wanna talk?」
Sora
「...With everyone, if possible. Misa and Mari too.」
％Ｂ
「Them too? So it's about the Tanabata Festival?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「Wanna meet up in the second chemistry classroom after school, then?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「Got it. I'll let the others know.」
Sora
「...Thanks... Then...」
all
She swiftly walks into her classroom.
％Ｂ
「Man, never would've thought Ousaka'd be the one to wanna talk about something.」

She might've thought of something after Saturday.
Anyway, I'll send Okihara-senpai and Shinozaki some LIME messages.
％Ｂ
「Morniiing.」
Natsuki
「Morniiing! So, how was Saturday?」

Segawa walks over to me as soon as I walk in.
％Ｂ
「Morning, Segawa. It was awesome.」

Natsuki
「How were the Maldives?」
Rikka
「What? ...The Maldives?」

Narusawa reacts next to me.
Natsuki
「This guy went to the Maldives on Saturday.」
％Ｂ
「No, I didn't. I've already explained this so many times...」
I explain what happened on Saturday to both Segawa and Narusawa.
Natsuki
「Huh, sea fireflies?」
Rikka
「...I've heard about them. It's apparently very pretty, and their lights look like something out of a dream.」

％Ｂ
「Nah, that was way more than just pretty. I seriously got emotional watching.」

％Ｂ
「I dunno how to describe it... If only I had a photo or something to show you. I think you'd at least understand a little bit that way.」

Natsuki
「But you do have photos.」
％Ｂ
「Uh...?」
Natsuki
「That's why I lent you my camera. Come on, hurry up and show us.」

％Ｂ
「...Ah.」
Natsuki
「Huh? Did you forget my camera at home?」
％Ｂ
「Uhh... Well... Yeah, I definitely forgot something...」
Natsuki
「What? Oh... Wait, you're not saying you...!」

％Ｂ
「Y-Yeah... I probably am saying that...」
Natsuki
「...So you forgot to take photos at all... Huh... I see... Hmm... Hoh...」

％Ｂ
「I-I got some great shots with the camera of my heart, though.」
Natsuki
「You don't really think I'd let it slide 'cause you said that, do you?」
％Ｂ
「Well, um, uh... It's just like, my breath was taken away, or I fell in love with the scene... It was crazy pretty!」

Rikka
「Your description's far too cliché to get the point across.」
％Ｂ
「Khh...」
After school.
Okihara-senpai, Shinozaki, and I go to the second chemistry classroom like Ousaka asked us to. Segawa's here too this time.

％Ｂ
「So what'd you wanna talk about?」
Sora
「I changed my mind.」
％Ｂ
「...Wha?」
Sora
「The astronomy club isn't going to participate in the Tanabata Festival.」
Marika
「Wha...?」
Misa
「Sora-san?」
Natsuki
「Well... that's a big statement.」
％Ｂ
「Wha... Now wait just one minuuute!」
What the hell is she saying!?
％Ｂ
「Wh-Why so suddenly!? Didn't you show us the planetarium only a few days ago!?」

Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「Shinozaki and I were super impressed by that, and we think it'd be great if there was something like that at the festival... I was looking up lots of stuff about planetariums this morning too...」


all
Natsuki
「Uhh, okay, okay! Let's just calm down. We haven't heard everything yet.」

Marika
「C-Could you explain why?」
all
Sora
「...Of course. That's why I asked you to come.」
Sora
「...In short, the astronomy club is returning to nonparticipant status for the Tanabata Festival. That's already been decided.」

Sora
「But... I'll be participating as an individual. As Ousaka Sora, a temporary member of the naturalist club.」

％Ｂ
「Huh? A temporary member of the naturalist club?」
Marika
「What... does that mean?」
Sora
「...The sea fireflies that Misa showed us were really pretty. I still can't forget how it looked. To be honest, it moved me a lot.」


Sora
「...And I got to hear how Misa feels about the Tanabata Festival too. I know she wants to move the hearts of lots of people.」

Misa
「Sora-san...」
Sora
「I know Misa can do it. She can make an aquarium that would make lots of people emotional. I want to see it too.」


Sora
「But we don't have enough people to do that and sea stars... ahem. See stars at the same time.」
...I feel like she threw something dumb in real casually just now...
Sora
「If we want the naturalist club's display to succeed, we need more people. So I've decided to help Misa too.」

％Ｂ
「So you mean... You're gonna give up on having something as the astronomy club and help the naturalist club's display?」

Natsuki
「And so that's why you're gonna be a temporary member of the naturalist club?」
Sora
「...I've been thinking about it since we saw the sea fireflies.」
％Ｂ
「...I knew something seemed off about you this morning.」
But I didn't think Ousaka was thinking about something like that.
％Ｂ
「You're right. If all of us focus on the naturalist club's display, then it might let us create something that's high quality.」

But... But I'm sure Okihara-senpai would―
Misa
「I cannot allow that.」
That's what I thought she'd say.
Misa
「I'm very happy for your feelings, Sora-san. But I'm sure that your feelings pertaining to the Tanabata Festival are the same as mine. I cannot allow you to sacrifice your own feelings.」


Yeah, I saw that coming a mile away.
Sora
「...You have the wrong idea, Misa.」
Misa
「The wrong idea?」
Sora
「Like I said earlier, I want to see the aquarium that you'll make. The aquarium that gets people emotional when they see it. That's my reason for participating in the Tanabata Festival.」


Sora
「Maybe it wasn't at first, but it is now.」
Sora
「That's why you have the wrong idea when you say I'm sacrificing my feelings.」
Misa
「That's... But...」
Sora
「And I'm a first year, and you're a third year. I still have chances to participate, but this year's your last. It's obvious which we should prioritize.」


Sora
「It's the last chance, so you'll only regret it if you make something so-so. You can't move people's hearts with something like that.」

Sora
「That's why I decided to help too. You don't need to worry about me.」

Sora
「...And if I'm helping, then I'll add in a bit of my own interests too.」
all
Natsuki
「Hmm... Well, isn't that fine? Sora's thought this through, and I think she's making the logical choice.」


Marika
「If you say so, Ousaka-san...」
all
The only problem is...
Misa
「Sora-san...」
If Okihara-senpai will allow that.

Sora
「...If you really won't let me, then I'll give up on being a temporary member. But I won't change my nonparticipation.」

Okihara-senpai suddenly approaches Ousaka and hugs her tight.

Sora
「...Oh... Ohh?」
Ousaka's eyes go wide at the unexpected gesture.
Misa
「I... couldn't possibly say no. Thank you very much, Sora-san... I will accept your feelings, as much as I am able.」


Natsuki
「Looks like it's settled, then.」
Marika
「That's great, Ousaka-san. And you too, Okihara-san.」
all
Natsuki
「Aw, man. I wish I could've seen the planetarium of the sea that changed Sora's heart like this. If only a certain someone had taken some photos.」


％Ｂ
「I already said I was sorry...」
Misa
「Would you like to see, then?」
Natsuki
「Wha... I can see the sea fireflies!?」
Misa
「Not the sea fireflies, but there is another version of the planetarium of the sea.」

％Ｂ
「Another version?」
all
Misa
「There is actually an idea I had when we initially went to that planetarium.」

Misa
「I did not think it would be possible for me alone, but we may be able to do it with Sora-san's help.」

Marika
「What kind of idea is that?」
Misa
「It is―」
Sora
「...Misa... Can't breathe...」
Misa
「Oh... I-I'm so sorry!」
Okihara-senpai finally pulls away from Ousaka.
Misa
「Ahem... My idea is a "starry night aquarium."」
％Ｂ
「A starry night aquarium...」
Natsuki
「Judging by the name, it sounds more like the inverse of the planetarium of the sea, instead of another version.」

Marika
「What would that be like?」
Misa
「Perhaps we could use the theme of the nighttime sea, and draw constellations on fish tanks? The fish would swim in a sea of stars.」


％Ｂ
「I see, drawing constellations on tanks...」
Sora
「...Photos would be better. It's prettier.」
Misa
「I see, I see. How very wonderful! Perhaps it may be even better if we could include explanations of the origins of the constellations as well?」


Sora
「...Not bad.」
Misa
「Isn't it!」
all
％Ｂ
「Uh... They've gotten real excited about this all of a sudden.」
Natsuki
「Looks like their ideas are matching up.」
Marika
「This is kinda looking like it'll be interesting～」
％Ｂ
「Yeah... You might be right.」
The naturalist and astronomy clubs... Or more like Okihara-senpai and Ousaka. They're both similarly eccentric people, drawn to the ocean and the stars respectively.

There's no way this wouldn't be interesting.
％Ｂ
「All right, then we should get in on the discussion too!」
Marika
「Yeah!」
