Our fulfilling life together seems long, yet short.
We're in our last year of university before we know it.
May―\nIt's been a whole five years since I've come back to Shionagi.
Which also means I've been with Rikka for five years.
Both of us have already completed all of our requirements for graduation, barring the credits we can only take as seniors.

So we're both currently focused on work directly relating to our futures.
I'm at Mr. Azuma's firm pretty much every day...
And Rikka's recently passed DVD judging to be selected to participate in a world-famous contest to be held in Moscow next month...

％Ｂ
「What's next?」
Rikka
「They're doing a special on tissue paper at the drug store. It's bottom price, and limit one per family.」

A brief moment of rest amidst the hustle and bustle of our lives.
Rikka and I are walking through the marketplace holding hands on a relaxed shopping date.
There's some kind of minor event happening today, so the area's filled with people.

It's apparently something along the lines of a hero show or a celebrity talk.

Rikka
「...I wonder if living together counts as family?」

％Ｂ
「Hm? Hmm～ I dunno. We're living together and all, but we're not legally family, so...」

％Ｂ
「Guess we can try taking two, and if they stop us, then that's that. Maybe we look more like brother and sister than we think.」
Rikka
「Mmmhhh... If someone said that, I'd make sure they knew they were wrong.」
％Ｂ
「...I thought you wanted two sets of tissues.」
Rikka
「Those are different matters. I want to stock up on tissues while they're cheap... but I'm conflicted.」

She lets go of my hand, places herself right next to me, and links arms with me.

Rikka
「We won't be mistaken as siblings this way, right? Hehehe.」
％Ｂ
「Someone would have to not have eyes at all to mistake us for siblings like this.」
all
Lost Preschooler
「Uuh, sniff, hic... Mamaaa...」
We spot a teary-eyed girl who looks like she's about preschool age as we're heading to the drug store.

Rikka
「Is she lost?」
％Ｂ
「Looks like it. Let's go see what's up.」
I approach the girl and crouch down so our eyes are at the same level.
％Ｂ
「What's wrong? Did you get separated from your mom?」
Lost Preschooler
「No, I didn't! Mama's the one who got lost!」
％Ｂ
「Hahaha...」
Rikka and I look at each other and smile wryly.
Seems like she's lost.
all
％Ｂ
「What's your name?」
Lost Preschooler
「Kasumi.」
％Ｂ
「Where's the lost child center here again?」
Lost Preschooler
「I'm not lost!」
Rikka
「Hehe, then let's go look together for your mom who got lost, okay?」

Lost Preschooler
「Then... okay. I can't believe Mama got lost.」
Rikka
「Hehe, that's true. What are we going to do with her? I wonder where she could have gone, leaving her important Kasumi-chan behind like this.」

Rikka holds Kasumi-chan's hand reassuringly.
I hold her other hand, putting her between the two of us.

all
％Ｂ
「All right, let's get looking, then.」
We ask Kasumi-chan about what her mom looks like, and start looking.
％Ｂ
「Can't find her...」
We walked all the way around the main street once, but we didn't spot anyone who seemed to match the description we were given.

Maybe we should move toward 2nd Street...
No, we should probably take her to the lost child center, even though Kasumi-chan wouldn't like that.

Lost Preschooler
「Sniff, hic, uuuhh... ueeehhh... Mamaaa...」
She's started to cry again.
Rikka
「Oh... Hey, could you watch Kasumi-chan for a second?」
％Ｂ
「Sure.」
all
Rikka looks over at a specific woman and runs over to her.

Isn't that...?
Rikka talks to her in a friendly way, bows to her, and comes running back.
％Ｂ
「That's not Ishizuka-san, is it?」
Rikka
「That's her. She works part-time at that music store.」
％Ｂ
「Huh... We come by here all the time, but I never knew.」
Rikka
「It isn't just Ishizuka-san. I run into Asakura-san a lot there too. Anyway, I asked her if I could borrow the piano that's set up in the plaza.」

There's a nearby signpost with signs for events like "Sonata for Piano and Violin in G Minor, Debussy" on it.

There are photos of up-and-coming local artists on there too.
The music store's listed as one of the cooperating establishments. It seems like the store maintains the piano for these events.

Rikka crouches back down to the girl's level, pulls out a handkerchief, and wipes away her tears.

Rikka
「Kasumi-chan, I like to play the piano. Do you want to sing a song together with me?」

Lost Preschooler
「A song?」
all
Rikka leads her over to the piano that's set up in the middle of the plaza and has her sit next to her.

Rikka
「Can you sing "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star"?」
Lost Preschooler
「I can. I learned it at preschool!」
Rikka
「Let's sing it together then, okay? Ready? One, two, three, go.」

all
A delicate, pretty melody rings out along with Rikka's singing.
And a little girl's voice, happily singing along.
Her tears are gone.
The people walking by all stop.
They all stare curiously at first, but they eventually just listen.
Everyone listens, from the little kids, to the high schoolers on dates, to the families here to enjoy themselves, to the elderly couples shopping.


all
％Ｂ
「It's always amazing...」
Rikka's piano playing can enthrall so many people.
Just like Rikka said Meguru-chan's piano playing did all those years ago.
And now―
％Ｂ
「It's a good thing we managed to find her mom.」
She apparently recognized Kasumi-chan's voice singing along to "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star."
She bowed her head in gratitude to us so much that it made us kinda embarrassed.
We thanked Ishizuka-san too, and left the plaza.
％Ｂ
「Still, I'm surprised. I didn't know you were good with kids.」
Rikka
「I think it's more like that was something I wanted to be. I want to be a mom like that.」

％Ｂ
「Something you wanted to be, huh...」
Rikka links arms with me tightly and looks up at me.
Rikka
「Kids are nice, aren't they?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, they are.」
Rikka
「I want to have your baby someday.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, sa... Wha?」
Rikka
「Ehehe.」
She looks too happy for me to make any tactless remarks.

I imagine walking hand in hand with Rikka and our child, just like we were with Kasumi-chan earlier...

The thought makes me want a kid too.
But there are things I need to do first, before that.
It's my duty as a man.
So wait just a little longer, Rikka.
