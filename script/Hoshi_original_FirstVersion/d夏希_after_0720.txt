「Zzz... Zzz...」
Natsuki
「Zzz... Zzz...」
％Ｂ
「Zzz... Nh... nnh...」
Natsuki
「Nh...」
％Ｂ
「...What time is it?」
Natsuki
「...Past eight.」
％Ｂ
「Ngh... We're off today, right...?」
Natsuki
「Mhm... We're off... Fuah... afh...」
％Ｂ
「What time did we go to sleep last night again?」
Natsuki
「Mmm... I think I went to bed a little past 1 a.m.」
％Ｂ
「So it was around two for me then...」
We've both been staying up late a lot recently.\n \n \n 
I've been working on the materials for my submission to the firm's competition, and Natsuki's been poring through potential photos for her contest. We both haven't been getting enough sleep because of how late we go to bed.

％Ｂ
「What do you think... Wanna go back to sleep?」
Natsuki
「That's a nice idea... but my body's used to waking up at the usual time, so I might not be able to...」

％Ｂ
「Same here... You have any plans today?」
Natsuki
「I was thinking of going out to take pictures again... but I think I might wanna take it easy for once today... What about you?」

％Ｂ
「I was thinking of working on my stuff for the competition too... but I'm kinda not really feeling it.」

Natsuki
「We've both been so busy lately...」
％Ｂ
「Yeeeah...」
％Ｂ
「...Wanna go on a date for once?」
Natsuki
「Huh?」
％Ｂ
「We haven't really gone out together in a while, right? How about we go someplace for a change?」

Natsuki
「...Yeah... That might be nice. So where are we going?」

Oh, she's eager.
％Ｂ
「Let's see... Is there anywhere you wanna go?」
Natsuki
「Mmm... We haven't gone to watch a movie in a while. De-stressing with karaoke wouldn't be bad either... and going out to eat something nice might be nice too...」


Natsuki
「Oh, I know! The beach! Let's go to the beach!」
％Ｂ
「The beach? Is it open already?」
Natsuki
「I'm pretty sure it opened yesterday. So let's go to the beach!」

％Ｂ
「Yeah... We haven't been to the beach in forever. Let's go, then!」
Natsuki
「Well then, let's get out of bed already and start getting ready!」
％Ｂ
「Let's do it!」
I haven't been this excited in a while.
％Ｂ
「Ohhhh! It's the beach!」
Natsuki
「Mmmm, it's so nice!」
The beach isn't crowded yet, but there's still a decent number of people here.\n\r

The beach houses have started business already too, of course.
％Ｂ
「Let's set up around here.」
I pick a random spot and lay out a blanket.
％Ｂ
「You want a parasol?」
Natsuki
「We don't need one. And I feel like taking in the sun anyway.」

％Ｂ
「Don't come crying to me if you get sunburnt.」
Natsuki
「As if. I'm going to use sunscreen. So here.」

She hands me a bottle of sunscreen.
％Ｂ
「What, I'm putting it on?」
Natsuki
「Of course you are. No complaining. I'll do it for you afterward.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, yeah.」
all
％Ｂ
「Whoa!? The water's colder than I thought...」
Natsuki
「Is it? It's not unbearable, though. I'm fine.」


％Ｂ
「No... This is pretty cold.」
Natsuki
「This is nothing if you've got guts like I do.」
％Ｂ
「...Are you implying I don't have guts?」
Natsuki
「Ohhh～? Did that come across that way～?」
all
％Ｂ
「All right then. I'll show you my guts! Rrraaahhh!」
％Ｂ
「It's... coooooolddd!」
Natsuki
「Aw, look at you. You're forcing yourself so hard～」
％Ｂ
「Kh... Qu-Quiet down over there!」
Natsuki
「Hyah!? That's cold! What the heck!」
％Ｂ
「So it is cold for you, then! Take this, and this!」
Natsuki
「H-Heeey! ～～Why, yooouu!!」
％Ｂ
「Cold!?」
Natsuki
「Take this, and that!」
％Ｂ
「Whoa!? It's so cooold!」
Natsuki
「Kyah!? You went for my chest just now! You perv! You pervo!」
％Ｂ
「Nbh! Pfeh, pfeh... You're going for the face now? Looks like I should stop going easy on you, then!」

Natsuki
「How naive! Humans have two hands, not just one! Take these delayed attacks!」
％Ｂ
「That's child's play! Legs are three times stronger than arms! Don't underestimate an ex-soccer player!」

Natsuki
「Ahahahahahah!」
％Ｂ
「Hahah... Ahahah!」
all
We're sitting on the blanket after we're done horsing around, looking out at the sea while sunbathing.

％Ｂ
「...That was pretty cliché of us earlier.」
Natsuki
「Yeah... but I think it was pretty fun. I haven't done anything like that in a while.」

％Ｂ
「...Yeah.」
It's been a while since we've gone to the beach, but I think I might not have had a water fight since I was a kid.

Natsuki
「...By the way. Remember how we came here to catch fish to display at the Tanabata Festival a long time ago?」


％Ｂ
「Oh yeah... When Okihara-senpai asked us to come with. She contacted everyone over LIME, so even Ousaka and Shuuichi came.」


Natsuki
「I remember Misa-san asked me to take photos of the fish for her.」

％Ｂ
「That's right. But you said you didn't like the photos you took then, and we ended up coming back to retake them.」


Natsuki
「I just had to have photos I was personally satisfied with. And I wanted to meet Misa-san's expectations too.」

％Ｂ
「And when we came to retake them, you swam in the water before they even opened the beach.」

Natsuki
「That was so cold... The water today doesn't even compare.」
％Ｂ
「You were shaking like crazy, with blue lips and everything.」
Natsuki
「You lent me your shirt, right? But it was still cold, so I stole your body heat directly.」


Natsuki
「I can still remember that now... Your body was really warm...」




Natsuki
「I don't think I'll ever forget the warmth from back then...」
％Ｂ
「...Sorry to interrupt you in the middle of your reminiscing, but...」
％Ｂ
「You're saying it like it's a nice memory, but it was awful for me. You called me a human hand warmer and touched me all over with your ice-cold hands.」


Natsuki
「Oh maaan～ It was sooo warm～」
％Ｂ
「And it was pretty embarrassing when some tourists saw us too.」
Natsuki
「Who cares? It's not like we were doing anything weird. You were so nice back 

then, Ryousukeee
theeen
.」
％Ｂ
「Whoa, hold on. I'm still nice now, aren't I?」
Natsuki
「I dunnooo. I feel like you haven't been nice enough lately, or more like there's not enough love or something. You don't really say it much anymore, you know?」

％Ｂ
「As if... I love you like crazy...」


Natsuki
「Huh? What was thaaat? What'd you say just nooow? I didn't heeear yooou.」
％Ｂ
「...You're not gonna get me that way.」
Natsuki's smirking at me.
She definitely heard...
Natsuki
「Maaan. I wanted you to say it one more tiiime.」
all
％Ｂ
「Hm? ...What's going on over there?」
There's a group of maybe four or five people walking around and talking to beachgoers.
One of them's a woman, and the rest are all men carrying cameras and shotgun microphones, following her around.

Natsuki
「Maybe they're doing something for TV? They're probably interviewing people 'cause it's right after the beach opened.」


Looks like Natsuki's right. The woman's holding a microphone, asking a young couple questions.

I spot the sticker on the camera. It's some local network.

Interviewer
「I see! Thank you very much!」
The woman turns toward us after finishing her interview with the couple.

Interview
「Oh, then let's speak with that couple over there next! Excuse me～ May I take a moment of your time～?」

％Ｂ
「Ack... She's coming this way!?」
Natsuki
「Welp... I mean, it's fine, I guess? Not like they're guaranteed to use the footage or anything.」

％Ｂ
「Hmm, guess so.」
all
Interviewer
「May I ask you a few questions? Where are the two of you from?」

％Ｂ
「Uhh... We're locals. We're both from Shionagi.」
Interview
「Oh, you're locals. Which would mean the two of you are here on a day off? Are you on a date, perhaps～?」


％Ｂ
「W-Well... Yes...」
Natsuki
「It's a date!」
Natsuki gives a clear answer after my own hesitant one.
Interviewer
「A beach date right after it's opened! How very nice～ What is your relationship? I assume you're dating?」


Ryousuke・Natsuki
％Ｂ
「No, we're married.」
Natsuki
「No, we're married.」
％Ｂ・Natsuki
％Ｂ
「No, we're married.」
Natsuki
「No, we're married.」
Crap! We totally just said the exact same thing at the exact same time!
Interviewer
「Oh really～ Oh my～ You two must get along very well to match up that perfectly～」


％Ｂ
「W-Well... Yes, we do... Haha...」
Natsuki
「Ehehe...」
Natsuki and I smile awkwardly with red faces.
That was a bit embarrassing just now...
Well, they're probably not going to use this footage anyway, so I guess we don't really need to worry...
