We've hit a long spring holiday streak just as I've gotten a tiny bit used to working.
It happened suddenly while I was helping Touko with her studying.
Touko
「...I wanna play! I wanna play I wanna play I～ wanna～ plaaaaay～!」

％Ｂ
「Whoah!? Y-You scared me out of my skin!」

Touko
「I don't wanna stay in the house aaall～ the time and just studyyy～! My butt's going to start growing roots! I'm going to get mold growing on my skiiin～ It's a holidaaaaaay～!」


Touko's stress must've built up from all the studying. She's finally exploded.

I think Touko's really done great to be this dedicated about studying until now.
But... I wish she wouldn't suddenly complain like this without warning.
％Ｂ
「Haha, it looks like some things never change. That's reassuring.」
Touko
「Mmhhh... Are you trying to say I'm a kid? I can't help it, I can't take it anymooore! Mmhh～!」


She puffs up her cheeks.
It's some kind of protest... but it just makes her look cute.
Touko
「Hey, aren't you tired from aaall the work you've been doing since you got hired? I think it might be about time to take a breather, you knooow?」


％Ｂ
「Yeah... Mr. Azuma told me I should make sure to take a proper break over this holiday. It'd be nice for us to go out and have fun for once.」

Touko
「Mhm! Yay, our first date in a while!」
She seems so happy.
Teacher also told me, "Stop working all the time and go have fun with Touko-chan too."

I can tell from Touko's smile that I haven't been able to give her the attention she's wanted because I've been so busy with work.

All right. I'll use my time off of work for Touko.
Let's have tons of fun and blow away the fatigue in our bodies and our hearts.
％Ｂ
「Wanna go on a trip somewhere, since it's a long holiday? Oh, but I wonder if we'd be able to reserve anywhere this late...」

Touko
「No, we don't need to do anything special. I wanna go on a normal date.」

％Ｂ
「You sure? I dunno when I'll be able to get a lot of time off like this again.」

Touko
「Mhm. I can save going on a trip as a reward for when I pass the exam. So work hard and make lots of money until then, okay? Ehehe, an overseas trip... I've never gone outside of Japan on a trip before.」


％Ｂ
「...You know what my salary is, right? People who just started don't make much.」
...Though I guess I'll grab a pamphlet or something at some point.\n \n\r
She'll probably start wanting to go somewhere crazy if I promise something beforehand, so I'll figure out a destination and a budget in secret first.

Touko
「You're off of work starting the day after tomorrow, right? Let's go on a date then, okay?」

％Ｂ
「All right, got it. I'll do my best to make sure I can finish up everything by tomorrow.」

Touko
「Mhm! Ehehe, I'm so excited...! Okay! I'll keep going for a little longer too!」
