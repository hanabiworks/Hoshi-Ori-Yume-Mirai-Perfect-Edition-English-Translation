「...」
I look up while I wait for the bus.
Beautiful flower petals frame the clear blue spring skies above me.

％Ｂ
「Ahh... This weather's great... Spring's in full bloom.」
Girls in school uniforms chat as they walk past me.

Female Student A
「Hey, do you think the upperclassmen are going to cry today?」
Female Student B
「I think our captain definitely will. She's strict, but she gets more emotional than you'd expect.」

Female Student C
「Oh, I know what you mean! I think she'll cry too!」

The girls take the crosswalk and line up at the bus stop on the other side of the street.\n\r

They continue their excited conversation all the way throughout.
％Ｂ
「...That takes me back.」
I recognize those uniforms.
They're Shionagi First Academy's.
I'll never forget it. My alma mater.
I spot the inbound bus that I'm waiting for.

I watch the city fly by through the window.
I remember how different the city looked from my memories as a kid back when I first came back here from Kanagawa.

％Ｂ
「...It's been eight years already.」
It's not just the city that's changed.
I've gone from being a student to a fully fledged working adult, and my school uniform's been exchanged for a suit.

My bag's stuffed with materials for work now instead of the textbooks and notebooks that used to fill it back when I was a student.

％Ｂ
「Oh... A graduation ceremony.」
I see an elementary school with a big signboard for its graduation ceremony displayed outside its gates.

％Ｂ
「Thinking about it, Shionagi First's might be today too...」
I think about the conversation I overheard.
It makes sense that they were talking about the graduation ceremony, since they were talking about their upperclassmen crying.

％Ｂ
「...Good thing the weather's nice.」
It was a snowstorm for ours.
A record-setting one, too. I remember the buses were crazy late, and the entire ceremony had to be shifted back by over an hour.

％Ｂ
「...The weather was so nice the year before, too.」
The graduation ceremony the year before mine was a beautiful one, with clear blue skies and blooming cherry blossoms.

As for why I remember that one well too...
It's because that was Misa's graduation ceremony.
％Ｂ
「...」
Okihara Misa.
The naturalist club's president, and its only member.
And... my girlfriend at the time.
Misa was usually all smiles, but that day she was crying, sad about having to part with me... with us.

But she smiled again right away...
And told us about how grateful she was that she had met us.
And just like that... she moved on to university.
％Ｂ
「...」
I made a promise with Misa back then.
That we'd always be together, even if we ended up going to different places.
I remember that promise clearly.
But...
％Ｂ
「...Eight years.」
％Ｂ
「Good morning!」
I loudly greet the empty firm.
It's what I always do, even though there's never anyone here.
It's a morning thing. Gets me pumped for work.
Now that I'm here before everyone else, I immediately start cleaning up the office.

I vacuum the floor, wipe down the desks, make coffee, and start organizing the materials I'm gonna use today.

％Ｂ
「Phew.」
These morning tasks have always been my job.
And the reason for that's simple.
Because I'm the lowest one on the totem pole here.
This is the Azuma Morio Architectural Firm.
I was able to get my dream job of working at the firm of the person I respect after graduating.

Senior Coworker
「Hey... Morning...」
％Ｂ
「Oh, good morning!」
I greet my senior worker once he arrives and pour some coffee.

％Ｂ
「Here you go, Shouji-san. Some coffee.」
Shouji
「Mhm... Thanks.」
％Ｂ
「You seem rather down. Did something happen?」
Shouji
「Well... Yeah, a bit.」
Firm Staff B
「Good morning.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, good morning!」
Firm Staff B
「Oh... Are you still depressed?」
Shouji
「...Shut up. Leave me alone.」
Firm Staff B
「I don't think there's any point to dwelling on it so much.」
％Ｂ
「Um... Did something happen?」
Firm Staff B
「He apparently gave someone who gave him chocolate for Valentine's a pretty intense White Day present.」

％Ｂ
「Uh huh... How intense?」
Shouji
「...A ring.」
％Ｂ
「...Seriously? How'd she react?」
Firm Staff B
「"I did not intend it in that way. Please forgive me for declining this gift." It was apparently a very businesslike rejection.」


％Ｂ
「Ah...」
Shouji
「Uuh... You can't blame me... She gave me such expensive-looking chocolate... I, I just thought she meant it that way...」

％Ｂ
「How long have you known her for that you'd actually give her a ring as a present?」

Shouji
「Well... She's a cabaret club girl I met three days ago.」
％Ｂ
「...Well of course she'd reject you.」
Shouji
「You too!?」
％Ｂ
「But come on, there's no way you'd get a 'love' chocolate three days after meeting her. And you tried to give her a ring in return... I think that's skipping at least a few too many steps.」


Shouji
「Kh... Why, you... What, you're looking down on me just 'cause you've got a girlfriend?」

％Ｂ
「No, I wasn't looking down on you...」
Shouji
「Hmph, well sooorry for not being able to pick up on hints! Not like you'd know how I feel anyway since you've got a girlfriend!」

％Ｂ
「Please don't sulk like that...」
Firm Staff B
「Oh... but Hino-kun, didn't you say that you broke up recently with your girlfriend after a fight?」

Firm Staff B
「Oh... but didn't you say that you broke up recently with your girlfriend after a fight?」

％Ｂ
「Gh...」
Shouji
「What? ...Did you really!?」
Firm Staff B
「She was your girlfriend since high school, wasn't she?」
％Ｂ
「Y-Yes, she was... Oh, but―」
Shouji
「Hey man... I'm sorry about that just now. I didn't know, and I said you had a girlfriend... That hurt, didn't it?」


％Ｂ
「No, you see―」
Shouji
「All right, let's go drinking tonight! How about we two rejectees drink 'til the morning light!」

％Ｂ
「Please don't suddenly think of me as a comrade!」
Shouji
「Yeah, yeah, I know! No need to say anything more! We're comrades! Ain't that right?」

This is becoming more and more of a pain...
Azuma
「Morning.」
％Ｂ
「Good morning, Chief!」
I use Azuma-san's timely arrival to cut Shouji-san's chumminess short.\n\r

I still want to call him "Teacher," but I hold it in.
Shouji
「Good morning.」
Firm Staff B
「Good morning, Chief.」
Azuma
「Yeah, looks like we're all here. Good-good. Hey, give me some coffee.」

％Ｂ
「Yes, right away.」
all
I pour him a cup of coffee and carry it to his desk.
％Ｂ
「Here you go.」
Azuma
「Thanks. Slurp... Phew. All right, we're gonna start today off with a meeting.」

A meeting first thing in the morning...
That's rare.
And Azuma-san's unusually bright-eyed today, even though he's usually so tired and sluggish in the mornings.\n\r

This might be about something important...
Azuma
「As you all know, this month's our accounting period. We've done several large-scale projects this year, with the Sendaya building and Green Hills―」

Like Azuma-san says, this year's been the busiest one I've experienced since joining the firm.

Azuma
「You've all done truly good work. I'm proud of you.」
Everyone looks relieved at his words of appreciation.

Azuma
「But, that was all commission work. People purchased our ability, and our results.」

Azuma
「That's well and good of course, but I personally felt it was a little underwhelming.」

Azuma
「Work has to be difficult. Only by overcoming difficult things can you expand your world.」

Mhm, mhm. That's some good stuff.
That's Teacher for you.
I wanna do work like that too!
Firm Staff A
「...He's really dramatic today. What's going on?」
Firm Staff B
「...Maybe it's the Heiwadai thing...」
Firm Staff C
「...Oh, that...」
I can hear my senior coworkers whispering.
Something about Heiwadai?
I wonder what they're talking about.
Azuma
「And so, I'm thinking we'll go find a project ourselves this next quarter.」

Azuma
「We're going to participate in a competition. It'll be for the remodeling job on the main building at Hokuou University's Heiwadai campus.」

Firm Staff A
「...I knew it.」
Firm Staff B
「Yes... Looks like you were right.」
A current of nervousness runs through the staff.
all
I know about Hokuou University too.
I also know that there's supposed to be a remodeling on its Heiwadai campus in the very near future.

The firm in charge still hasn't been decided.
Azuma-san's saying our firm should announce ourselves to try to be the one responsible for that job.

Azuma
「Anyone have any thoughts on the matter?」
Firm Staff C
「...」
Firm Staff B
「...」
％Ｂ
「Um... May I?」
I raise my hand.
It's my role as the lowest-ranked person here to be aggressive about stating my opinions.

As the lowest-ranking person, I can be forgiven for saying things to Azuma-san that other more senior staff might be hesitant to say.

In a nutshell, I'm expected to be stupid.
Azuma
「Sure, say it.」
％Ｂ
「Hokuou University has an architecture department, doesn't it?」
Azuma
「That's right, it does.」
％Ｂ
「And their alumni include famous architects. Like Sekitani Yuuya, for instance.」

Sekitani Yuuya's a spirited newcomer who's currently all the rage in the field.
％Ｂ
「I'm sure people like him will try to claim the right to remodel their alma mater. The university would want an alumnus to take it on too... Would that not be the case?」


I already know it's a rude thing to say.
Azuma
「Hoh... So what you're saying is that I don't compare to Sekitani?」
％Ｂ
「I-I didn't say that! I know you're the best, Teacher!」

Azuma
「That was a joke. And stop with the "Teacher"...」
％Ｂ
「I'm sorry, it just slipped out...」
Azuma
「Hmph... Well, I understand what you're trying to say. I'm well aware we're at a disadvantage. I'm sure Sekitani'll participate in this competition.」


Azuma
「But... that's why it'll be interesting, right?」
He smiles fearlessly.
Azuma
「I just said so, didn't I? Work should be difficult. This is an interesting situation that's worth trying to take on.」

％Ｂ
「...You're right.」
Shouji
「I bet everyone's thinking that they're gonna pick an alumnus, especially Sekitani.」

Firm Staff B
「If we can get the job over him and the others, then everyone in the industry would be talking about it...」

％Ｂ
「I see...」
I'm kinda starting to get pumped too.
Azuma
「No objections? If not, then I'm going to get started on divvying up the roles.」

all
The work I've done for the firm so far has included model-making, putting together documents, and grunt work.

This is a big project.
I'd be especially happy if I got to do something different from what I've already been doing for a job like this...

Azuma
「Now then... What do you think's most important for a competition or presentation?」

％Ｂ
「I know! Thorough research. I believe knowing your client's opinions well would be particularly crucial.」

Azuma
「Hoh, well aren't you just the perfect professional.」
He smirks at me.
％Ｂ
「I-I apologize.」
Azuma
「You're exactly right. If there are ten people involved, then there are ten different points of view to consider. It's important to gather information on all of those.」


Azuma
「And so I'm going to meet with Hokuou University's upper management, starting with the university chancellor, and figure out the concepts they've got in mind.」

Azuma
「You all do that with the ones who'll actually be using the facilities. The students and staff members. Get in touch with them and get their opinions.」

Shouji
「Understood.」
Firm Staff B
「I'll schedule an appointment immediately.」
Azuma
「I'm counting on you two. Oh, and Hino, you're gonna tag along with them this time.」

Azuma
「I'm counting on you two. Oh, and you're gonna tag along with them this time.」

％Ｂ
「Huh? ...Me too?」
Azuma
「I think you've been starting to get the hang of working here. I bet you're itching to try doing something other than building models or putting together documents.」

％Ｂ
「I certainly am!」
Azuma
「You'll be involved in the planning from now on. You better do a good job.」

％Ｂ
「I'll do my best!」
All right!
I'm finally being entrusted with new work!
I'll need to give it my all, so I can meet Azuma-san's expectations!
Azuma
「All right, everyone. Get to work.」
％Ｂ
「Yes!」
all
Azuma-san wraps up the meeting.
I return to my desk, fist-pumping internally.
Shouji
「Good for you! It's 'cause you've been trying so hard.」

％Ｂ
「Yes, thank you very much! I'm looking forward to working with you!」
Shouji
「Mhm, mhm! Now that's the spirit. You've gotta focus hard on work so you can forget about your breakup with your girlfriend.」


％Ｂ
「Uh... Are we talking about this again?」
Firm Staff B
「Oh... But didn't she go to Hokuou University? I remember you saying that.」

％Ｂ
「Y-Yes... She does...」
Shouji
「Huh, really? That's a bit awkward... Doesn't that mean that the more you try to focus on work, the more it'll hurt your heart?」


Shouji
「What if you suddenly start thinking about your girlfriend and start crying while we're gathering data...」
％Ｂ
「Why would I cry!? And besides―」
Azuma
「Hey, give me another cup of coffee.」
％Ｂ
「Y-Yes! Right away!」
Shouji
「Let's do our best and show your ex who's boss!」
％Ｂ
「Let's stop talking about that already!」
More importantly... It's time to work!
I've come to Hokuou University with my senior coworker.
Shouji
「So this is Hokuou's campus... I've never been here. It's got a lot of class, but I guess that's what you'd expect from a former imperial university.」

％Ｂ
「It's famous for having delicious, cheap cafeteria food. You can get this thick cut of cow tongue for just 500 yen.」

Shouji
「You sure know a lot.」
％Ｂ
「I used to come here a lot. I went to the cafeteria pretty often, since they don't really mind who comes and goes on a university campus.」


Shouji
「Ah～ I get it. You came here to visit your ex, did you? Hmhm, so I guess this place must hold a lot of bittersweet memories for you.」

％Ｂ
「...Whatever. I don't even care anymore.」
Though he isn't completely wrong.
I have a lot of memories associated with Misa here.

Hokuou's a top-class national university, right behind Touou and Kyouou University.\n\r

Misa enrolled in the department of aquatic agriculture and marine science here.
Hokuou University has an architecture department, but I never applied here.
There was a professor I wanted to get to know at a different university.
And also because this is a really high-level university...
But I came here a lot to see Misa.
Every day was so much fun back then.
She shined like Shionagi's sea.
She always told me she was going to learn marine science here so she could do research.\n\r

And one day...
％Ｂ
「...Man, this takes me back.」
Shouji
「Oh, opening up old wounds already?」
％Ｂ
「Uh...」
Crap, I wasn't thinking...
Shouji
「Mhm, mhm. Feel free to do that as much as you want today. Can't have you breaking out into tears in the middle of a planning session.」

％Ｂ
「I told you, I won't cry! Come on, let's get going already! We shouldn't make the other party wait!」

Shouji
「Look at you, acting all tough.」
We're waiting for the person we're supposed to be meeting in a reception room.
University Researcher
「I apologize for the wait.」
They walk into the room.
It's two people in lab coats. One of them is a man in his mid-thirties.
University Researcher
「Pleased to meet you. I'm Orikasa Susumu, a senior research fellow here at Hokuou University's agriculture program.」

By research fellow, he means he's employed here chiefly as a researcher by the university.\n\r

Though this is just something I know from what Misa told me.
University Researcher
「And this is my assistant.」
He introduces the other lab-coated individual.
Misa
「My, my. I'm pleased to make your acquaintance. I am a junior research fellow for Hokuou University's aquatic agriculture and marine sciences department. My name is Okihara Misa.」


％Ｂ
「...」
...You've gooot to be kidding meee.
Shouji
「Thank you so very much for taking time out of your busy schedules to meet with us. Oh, I'm Shouji Motoharu, from the Azuma Morio Architectural Firm.」


Misa
「Thank you very much for the polite introduction. Ufufu.」

％Ｂ
「...」
...Whyyy is Misa heeere?
Shouji
「Hey... Hey, Hino!」
Shouji
「Hey... Hey!」
all
％Ｂ
「Uh... Oh, yes? What is it?」
Shouji
「No, not "what is it"! Your business card! And the gift!」

％Ｂ
「Oh... Y-Yes!」
Shouji
「I apologize for our firm's newest hire. He still hasn't quite managed to shake how green he is... even though this is his third year working with us...」

Misa
「Oh my, is that so? That makes him just one year my junior, then.」

Shouji
「My, you're so mature I can hardly believe there's only a year's difference between you two! Come on, your business card.」


％Ｂ
「Y-Yes. I apologize for the late introduction.」
I hand my business card over.
％Ｂ
「My name is... ％Ａ ％Ｂ, likewise from the Azuma Morio Architectural Firm.」
Misa
「And again, my name is Okihara Misa. Thank you very much for coming today.」

％Ｂ
「Thank you, and likewise...」

I'm a little freaked out from this coincidence.
Hokuou University's a real mammoth of a university, with over 6,000 faculty members and over 20,000 students.
I can't believe I'd run into her here...
I've known for a while now that Misa stayed here as a junior research fellow.\n\r

But still, I can't believe she was one of the people we were supposed to meet...
all
I give them our gift, and we sit down.
Shouji
「I apologize for any offense, but I was under the impression that university staff would be at least in their late twenties. You're very young, Okihara-san.」

University Researcher
「Yes, she's very gifted when it comes to marine sciences. She may be young, but she already has her PhD. She's very much the flower of our lab.」


Shouji
「How incredible! Yes, and she's very pretty too.」

Misa
「Oh no, not at all. But I'm very happy you think so. Thank you very much... Ufufu.」


％Ｂ
「...」
It's kinda hard to say anything...
all
University Researcher
「And so, we're meeting today to...?」
Shouji
「Oh, yes. Hino will explain things briefly.」


Shouji
「Oh, yes. We will explain things briefly.」


％Ｂ
「...Yes. Ahem... Err... We have heard that your institution will be holding a competition in order to determine the firm that will be responsible for the renovations for your campus's main building.」

％Ｂ
「Our firm would relish the opportunity to participate.」

％Ｂ
「And so if we are to participate, we would like to take into account all thoughts, opinions, and requests regarding renovation's concept. And so we have humbly asked to take time out of your day to do so.」


University Researcher
「I see. Yes, I understand.」
Misa
「We are also aware of the competition for the renovations.」
Misa
「There are several other architectural firms that have come to our campus, but yours would be the first to ask the opinions of those who actually work here, like us.」


Misa
「We are very thankful for your firm's passion. We would love to support you through the competition.」

％Ｂ
「Oh, well... Thank you... Hahaha...」
It's vaaaguely difficult to say anything...
I haven't been able to look her in the eye this whole time.
Misa
「The environmental experiment building is an annex to our campus's main building, which means we of the marine sciences department use it often. We would be happy to cooperate in order to make it a more convenient facility.」

％Ｂ
「Yes... Thank you very much.」
all
University Researcher
「Oh... I'm sorry, may I step outside briefly?」
Shouji
「Yes, of course. We're the ones taking up your busy schedule here, after all.」

The male researcher steps out of the room to take a phone call.
Leaving just me, my senior coworker, and Misa in the room.
Misa
「Thank you very much for the gift. I love edamame daifuku. We will share these with everyone in the lab.」


Shouji
「We just happened to pass by as they finished making them. I think they might still be warm.」

Misa
「Yes, they are～ ...They seem very delicious.」
Her expression loosens a bit. Maybe it's because her superior's left the room.
Shouji
「But still, it's very impressive that you have a PhD at your age. I'm very happy to have the opportunity to speak with someone with your unique perspective.」

Misa
「Oh my, thank you very much for the flattery.」
Shouji
「Oh no, it's all the truth. Right, Hino?」
Shouji
「Oh no, it's all the truth. Right?」
％Ｂ
「Wha? O-Oh, yes... I also think so.」
Shouji
「See? He's been so distracted this whole time because you're so pretty. Honestly, I must apologize for his sake.」


Misa
「Ufufu... I hope you can relax here. And I think it's very wonderful that you are a first-class architect already at such a young age.」


She looks at my business card and smiles.
Shouji
「Oh no, no, no, no! There are thousands of new architects every year. This isn't very impressive at all.」


％Ｂ
「Well, um...」
Shouji
「He's nothing compared to you, Okihara-san. And if I may be so forward, I believe there are not too many female researchers?」


Misa
「Well, yes... I do believe there are fewer female research fellows than male, yes. Academia is a male-dominated world.」


Shouji
「It's the same as our industry. It's all men in our field, and we're so swamped with work it's hard to even go out and meet people...」


Misa
「It's very similar for me. I'm so busy with research day after day that I cannot even go out on dates. I feel very sorry for my boyfriend.」


I feel like... Misa glanced at me as she said that.
Shouji
「Boyfriend... Ah yes, of course someone like you would have one. I'm sure he must be very wonderful.」


Misa
「Ufufu... I'm not one to boast, but he really is. Though this may not be the right situation to speak of such things...」

Shouji
「Oh no, no, no, no! I'm sure he's a very impressive working man.」

Misa
「Thank you very much. But... things haven't been going very well lately.」

Shouji
「Oh? Did you have a fight or something, perhaps?」
Misa
「Yes, somewhat...」
Shouji
「What a coincidence. It's actually the same for Hino here. He apparently broke up with his girlfriend recently after they had a fight.」

Shouji
「What a coincidence. It's actually the same for this guy here. He apparently broke up with his girlfriend recently after they had a fight.」

Misa
「What!? ...I-Is that so!?」
％Ｂ
「No! We didn't break up!」
all
Shouji
「Oh, come on now. There's no need to try to show off just because we're talking to someone so pretty.」

％Ｂ
「I'm not showing off. I'm saying it because we really haven't broken up.」

Shouji
「But you said back at the office―」
％Ｂ
「I did not! Yes, we did have a fight... but we haven't broken up. You all just convinced yourselves of that.」


I tried to clear things up, but something more important came up every time, so I just decided to let it be.

Shouji
「...So you two are really still dating?」
％Ｂ
「Of course we are. My girlfriend's completely wasted on me, so there's no way I'd let her go.」


％Ｂ
「My girlfriend is very important to me.」
Misa
「...You must love your girlfriend from the bottom of your heart, Hino-san.」

Misa
「...You must love your girlfriend from the bottom of your heart.」

％Ｂ
「Yes... It makes me blush to say it, but I love her more than anything in the world.」
Misa
「I see...」
Shouji
「You... I'm surprised you've got the nerve to brag like that in front of Okihara-san...」
％Ｂ
「...」
I didn't intend on saying something like that in a place like this either.
It just ended up coming out.
Misa
「...Your girlfriend is very lucky indeed to have you say such things about her.」

％Ｂ
「...Do you think so?」
Misa
「Yes. I do. I'm sure your girlfriend also wishes to make amends with you as soon as possible.」


％Ｂ
「...I would be happy if that were the case. I want to make up with her as soon as I can. I love her, so this is very hard on me...」


Misa
「Oh...」
all
University Researcher
「I apologize for the intrusion.」
The male researcher comes back, ending our conversation.
University Researcher
「Let's see, you said you would like to hear our requests, yes? I think it would be better for you to actually see the facilities for yourself rather than just sit here and talk... Would you like to?」


Shouji
「Yes, of course.」
University Researcher
「Then let us go immediately.」
The male researcher and Misa tell us their opinions as they guide us through the campus's main building.

Shouji
「Thank you very much for everything today. We would love to take your opinions and requests into account for our design.」


University Researcher
「We're glad to have been of assistance.」
％Ｂ
「We'll be leaving now, then.」
Misa
「Yes. Thank you very much for coming today.」
all
We all bow politely, putting an end to our meeting.
Shouji
「But man, that Okihara-san sure was pretty!」
％Ｂ
「...Yes, she was.」
Shouji
「Beautiful and talented. And that figure, on top of that! I bet her boyfriend's crazy handsome! Dammit, the world's so unfair!」


％Ｂ
「...It-It is... isn't it...」
Shouji
「Now then, I'm going to go back to the firm for now, but what about you? Chief's said we could go home right after the meeting today if we wanted.」

％Ｂ
「Oh, then I'll do a bit of research before going home. I was thinking I may go back to the campus.」

Shouji
「Oh? Gonna go tour places while thinking about your ex?」
％Ｂ
「I told you we didn't break up! I just want to go look around a little more, for work.」

Shouji
「Tch! Well aren't you a lucky guy, dammit... I'll be going back, then.」
％Ｂ
「Yes. Thank you very much for today.」
I take my phone out after seeing him off.
％Ｂ
「...Who'd have thought this would happen...」
【％Ｂ】「My coworker just left. #NI'm still near campus. #NCan we talk later?」
【Misa】_st_0219
％Ｂ
「...!?」
Misa
「Yes, of course.」
I hear her reply from right behind me.
Misa
「Ufufu!」
I turn around to see Misa standing behind me, phone in hand and a smile on her face.
Misa
「Hino-san, I thought you had gone home?」
Misa
「Oh my. I thought you had gone home?」
She's speaking the same way she was during the meeting.
％Ｂ
「...Actually, my girlfriend works here at this university.」
I do likewise.
％Ｂ
「We've both been busy after our fight, so we haven't been in contact for a bit... but I thought this may be a good opportunity for us to make up.」


Misa
「I see. And so you stayed here and contacted your girlfriend.」

％Ｂ
「Yes... I was thinking it would be nice if she were thinking the same thing I was, like you said earlier, Okihara-san.」


Misa
「But why did you get into a fight in the first place?」
％Ｂ
「...She told me she wanted to go overseas, and I didn't want her to. My girlfriend does research for your university's marine sciences department. She wanted to see a new species of fish that had apparently been discovered.」


Misa
「That must be the ghost lampfish. It's currently a very hot topic among marine scientists worldwide. I would also love to see it for myself.」


％Ｂ
「I understand, I really do. But the issue lies with the destination, an island nation in southeastern Asia known as the Republic of Andaman. I'm sure you're aware of it.」


Misa
「Yes, of course.」
％Ｂ
「Then I'm sure that someone as intelligent as you would understand why I wouldn't want her to go. You are aware of the situation over there, yes?」


Misa
「That would be...」
She makes a bit of an awkward face.
Misa
「...It's a very beautiful, nice place.」
％Ｂ
「Please don't try to fool me. That was the case a short while ago. The country is currently under martial law after the recent military coup d'état.」


Misa
「Th-That was due to corruption in the government... The citizens support the coup there, and it isn't dangerous at all. Though there have been frequent bombings, there haven't been any injuries or casualties...」


％Ｂ
「No means no!」
Misa
「Auuuh...」
％Ｂ
「What are you gonna do if something happens? I'm worried about you, Misa.」

％Ｂ
「I get that you wanna see that new species of fish, I really do. But... I want you to think about how I feel!」

Misa
「...I'm sorry.」
I let myself get excited and ended up speaking roughly.
Misa's usual smile's a sad frown.
It hurts me to see her like this...
％Ｂ
「Ahem... I'm not saying you can't ever go. You can go once things settle down over there.」

％Ｂ
「The two of us can go together then.」
Misa
「What...?」
％Ｂ
「Though it won't be for a while, 'cause I'll be busy with this competition thing for work... But either way, when you go, I'll come with.」


％Ｂ
「I'll be more at ease that way, you know?」
Misa
「Ryousuke-san...」
Misa
「Oh...」
％Ｂ
「If you wanna see something, then I wanna see it too. So... we'll definitely go together someday.」

Misa
「Yes... I understand! I'm looking forward to it! Ufufufufu!」

Misa
「My boyfriend is such a wonderful person!」
％Ｂ
「My, my. You must be very happy.」
Misa
「Yes! I'm very happy right now!」
That might've been a bit conceited of me to say...
But, well, whatever.
I got to see her smile for the first time in a while this way.
％Ｂ
「Will you be leaving for today, then?」
Misa
「Yes. Though I will need to return to the lab to grab my things.」
％Ｂ
「Then... if it is agreeable with you, would you like to have a drink together, as a symbol of bettering our relationship? My treat, of course.」

I've returned to my formal tone.
Misa
「Is that an entertainment offer? I personally do not condone collusive relationships with businesspeople... but... that is a very wonderful suggestion!」


％Ｂ
「Then, to celebrate us making up...」
Misa
「Yes! To celebrate us making up...!」
％Ｂ & Misa
「Cheers!」
％Ｂ & Misa
「Cheers!」
We're at a bar.
Misa and I are having a beer to celebrate us making up.
Misa
「Ngh... Ngh... Ngh... Aahhh～ It's delicious～!」

％Ｂ
「You can really drink, huh...」
Misa can hold her alcohol unusually well.
She can drink more than I can, and all drinking does is get her a bit red. It never seems to affect her much, no matter how much she drinks.

Misa
「Ufufu, I'm so happy about getting to make up with my boyfriend that I may drink far more than usual today.」

％Ｂ
「Please drink as much as you'd like. Your boyfriend's in a good mood today too.」

Misa
「Ufufu... Thank you very much. Then I will take you up on your offer, and have another...」

％Ｂ
「Sure thing. You gonna go with another beer for now?」
Misa
「I would love to! I think I'll be able to get very comfortably drunk today!」

Misa
「I couldn't sleep last night... I ended up crying in the middle of the night. I just suddenly felt very lonely...」


Misa
「I was wondering why I couldn't make up with someone I loved so much... What if he disappeared from my side...」

％Ｂ
「Don't say stupid stuff.」
Misa
「Yes... I'm stupid...」
％Ｂ
「There's no way I'd disappear.」
Misa
「Oh...」
％Ｂ
「You're the only one I love.」
Misa
「...Are you drunk?」
％Ｂ
「I'm not gonna get drunk off of half a beer. Those are sober words.」

Misa
「Eheheeeh, that's kind of very wonderful.」
Misa
「Aaah, I'm feeling more and more drunk...」
％Ｂ
「You sure it's not 'cause you're chugging down a huge stein of beer?」
Misa
「Oh no, this would be because I'm drunk off of my boyfriend's sweet-talking.」
％Ｂ
「Nope, I think it's the alcohol. Look, here's your second beer.」

Misa
「Wah～! Let's have a toast! To my beloved boyfriend!」

％Ｂ
「Yeah-huh, cheers. Look at you, you're getting even redder...」

Misa
「Yeees～ I'm all drunk! I'm completely drunk off my wonderful boyfriend's love. Ufufufu...」


She smiles radiantly.
She drinks her beer slower this time, and looks at me tenderly.

％Ｂ
「Dammit, you're so cute...」
Misa
「Did you say something～?」
％Ｂ
「Nothing. Just noticed you had some foam around your mouth.」
Misa
「I wonder if the person I love could wipe it away with a kiss～」
％Ｂ
「Here, give me your mouth. I'll use this handwipe to get it.」

Misa
「Nooo～ I want a kiiiss.」
％Ｂ
「Nooope.」
Misa
「Auuuh...」
％Ｂ
「Not even if you look at me like that. We... We'll kiss afterward.」

Misa
「Afterward? I can... have you do it afterward? Really? It's a promise, okay? Definitely, definitely swear that... Wapfh?」

Misa
「Please don't plug my mouth with the handwiiipe～」
％Ｂ
「I promise, so quiet down... Okay?」
Misa
「Okaaay～... Ehehe...」

She's all smiles.
...She totally made a scene like that on purpose.
％Ｂ
「Ahem... Anyway, I think Shionagi First Academy's graduation ceremony was today.」

％Ｂ
「I saw some girls wearing the uniform this morning, and they were talking about the ceremony.」

Misa
「Yes, it is the end of March, come to think of it. How very nostalgic.」

Misa
「It's already been... eight years since then.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, it has. Eight years already...」
Misa
「...How very strange.」
Misa
「I can remember the day we met, and the Tanabata Festival... as if it were only yesterday. I can't believe it's been eight whole years since then...」


％Ｂ
「Yeah, time sure flies.」
Misa
「But it has been a very happy eight years.」
Misa
「I've been together with the person I love for eight years... It's a very happy thing, isn't it?」

％Ｂ
「Y-Yeah... It is.」
She looks right into my eyes.
She's always straightforward with her words, but she's really hitting hard today.

I guess it's 'cause we've just made up?
Maybe I'll just hurry up and get drunk too...
％Ｂ
「...Maybe I should go for some sake for my second drink?」
Misa
「Oh, then I'll pour it for you. Excuse me!」

Misa orders it for me.
The sake arrives in a ceramic decanter.
Misa
「Now then, thank you very much for your hard work today. Oh myyy～」

％Ｂ
「O-Oh my～」
Misa always does this when we get sake.
Even though she's not even pouring it that fast.
Misa
「...Um, Ryousuke-san.」
Misa
「...Um, I should say.」
She suddenly looks at me with serious eyes.
Misa
「Thank you very much for always being so kind when I'm always being selfish.」

Misa
「I'm so genuinely glad I was able to meet you. And hearing you say you love me more than anything in the world... made me very happy.」


％Ｂ
「Nh...」
I gulp down the sake.
My body temperature spikes.
％Ｂ
「...I should be saying that. I'm... so happy that I met you, and we're together like this.」


Misa
「Ufufu...」
％Ｂ
「How about I pour you one, then? You want some sake? We've got two cups here.」

Misa
「Yes, I'd love some!」
％Ｂ
「Though you might not be able to go home if you drink too much, even if it is you...」

Misa
「Mmm～ But it seems to me that, the way things are going, my boyfriend wouldn't let me go home anyway...」

％Ｂ
「I really won't let you go home if you keep that up.」
Misa
「I would love to see you try. Oh myyy～」

She smiles and pours me another.
