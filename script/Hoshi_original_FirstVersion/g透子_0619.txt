The doors to the old school building were open.
Yukimura should've received my message yesterday, so she should be waiting for me inside.

I head toward the furthest-in classroom we always hang out in.
I can feel my heartbeat quicken bit by bit. I move forward a little nervously.

Touko
「Hey. Welcome.」
％Ｂ
「...Yo. I thought you might not be waiting for me 'cause you never responded.」
Touko
「Ahh... Sorry. I had a lot going on, so I forgot to respond.」
％Ｂ
「Come on, you gotta respond. I was worried.」
Touko
「I'll take care from now on. So what did you want today?」
％Ｂ
「I couldn't come here yesterday. Sorry about that.」
Touko
「It's fine. It's not like you have to come every day, right?」
％Ｂ
「Coming here's become a daily habit for me. I feel weird if I don't come.」

Touko
「Ahaha, so you like this place too? I won't give you the key, though.」

％Ｂ
「That key's yours. It wouldn't suit me.」
Touko
「Well, this'll only be for a little longer anyway. I'll need to find a new place to set up shop soon.」

％Ｂ
「...I've thought of a good idea for that. Wanna hear it?」
Touko
「Do you mean... what we were talking about before?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. I think this building's going to be opened up for use for the Tanabata Festival. If that happens... I'm thinking of volunteering to be in charge of that.」

Touko
「Huh? Be in charge? What's that mean?」
％Ｂ
「I'd be assigning and preparing areas, managing things on the day of the festival... I'd be the one taking care of everything to protect this place that's so special to you.」

Touko
「That's... Isn't that too much for you to do by yourself?」
She sounds skeptical.
It's the response I was expecting. I answer her question with a question of my own.
％Ｂ
「You think so too?」
Touko
「Anyone would. You already seem busy enough as it is, and now you want to do all that...」

％Ｂ
「Let's do it together, then. Be in charge of the old school building with me, Yukimura.」

Touko
「...Huh? Wh-What are you talking about?」
％Ｂ
「You're the one who said I wouldn't be able to do it alone. So let's do it together.」

Touko
「It-It doesn't have to be me, does it? You could just ask someone else in the event committee...」

％Ｂ
「I've gotta do it with you. There's no point if it isn't with you.」
Touko
「...Why?」
My heart's ringing like an alarm bell. I can't move my body smoothly from my nervousness.
I take a small, but deep breath to calm my heart at least a little.
I'm gonna make it simple.
I feel like being tricky or indirect would have the opposite effect from what I want.
％Ｂ
「Because I like you. I want to protect this precious place that I've spent time with you in... I want you to do good work in the event committee, together with me.」


I wait for her response.
Every second that passes seems like an eternity. The silence of the old school building amplifies my anxiety.

Touko
「...Ahaha. I... don't really like those kinds of jokes.」
％Ｂ
「Wha...?」
Touko
「Don't you think you're confessing to the wrong person? I think there's probably someone else you should be saying things like that to.」

...I definitely didn't expect this.
She's deflecting my confession in a different way.
What do I do? Should I just keep pressing forward?
Be persistent.
Try again some other time.
％Ｂ
「No! I'm serious! It's not a joke!」
Touko
「Oh, I get it! This is practice! Yeah, there's no one to get in your way here, so you can practice without anyone else knowing.」

％Ｂ
「No, that's not what I'm...!」
Touko
「Mhm, I think that was great! I'm sure being straightforward like that would make a girl happy.」

It's like trying to push together two magnets of the same polarity.
I'm trying to approach her with how I feel, but she just slips away.

Touko
「Mmm... If you're taking suggestions, I think a little more smiling would've been nice. Being too stiff's a negative, you know.」

％Ｂ
「...」
Touko
「Come on, smile! Things won't go well when you actually do the real deal if you're nervous when you're practicing. Relax more...」

％Ｂ
「Yukimura, wait a second!」
Touko
「...What?」
％Ｂ
「...Why are you saying this?」
Touko
「...I think I might wanna ask you the same thing.」
％Ｂ
「Wha...?」
Touko
「Things are fine the way they are. Our relationship right now's about perfect. We don't have to worry about each other any more than necessary this way, right?」


％Ｂ
「I don't think...」
Touko
「I do. It's an important issue to me.」
Touko
「Worrying about people or being worried over tires me out. I want to live a more carefree life, you know?」

Yukimura hates being tied down.
And it looks like my affections aren't an exception. She wants to be free.

Touko
「It's not that I don't like being with you. But when you're with someone... you think about that kinda stuff, right? Especially since you and I are boy and girl.」


％Ｂ
「...Is that why you're always alone?」
Touko
「I guess so. So you should rethink things.」

％Ｂ
「...」
...Things didn't go well, but I did get something out of this.
I was able to learn just a bit about Yukimura.
Something central about why she's always alone.
It's not that I've been completely rejected. I still have a chance.
I shouldn't give up yet.
Touko
「Now then, I think that's the end of that conversation. So I think we're done...」
％Ｂ
「No... There's still more. Let me say a bit more.」
I've gotten this far. I want to go on for just a little longer.
Being too persistent would probably have the opposite effect, so I'll just put one foot in the door.

％Ｂ
「I understand how you feel. But I'm not gonna give up.」

Touko
「...Come on. Weren't you listening to me?」
％Ｂ
「I did. That's why I'm saying this.」
Touko
「...」
％Ｂ
「I get what you're trying to say. There's lots of stuff that's annoying when it comes to dealing with other people.」

Touko
「...I'd like it if you could leave me alone, then.」
％Ｂ
「I wanna do everything including that stuff. I'm sure it'd be fun if it's with you.」

Touko
「Mmm... I don't know about that. You'd just be sticking your face into something troublesome.」

％Ｂ
「Guess that's just the kinda person I am. Maybe being an event committee member's a good fit for me.」

Touko
「...You sure are weird.」
％Ｂ
「I don't wanna hear that from you. Well, I guess we're both weird?」

Touko
「Oh, that's how you respond? I'm not going to talk to you anymore, you know.」
％Ｂ
「Wha!? I-I take it back! It's just me who's weird!」
Touko
「No taking back what you saaaid. I see, so that's what you think of me...」

Yukimura's tone suddenly dips.
Crap! I shouldn't have said that!
Touko
「I can't believe you'd call a girl weird... That's a little tactless, don't you think?」

％Ｂ
「Wait, but you were the one who said it first!」
Touko
「I've never been told that by a boy. It hurts more than I expected...」

％Ｂ
「I-I'm sorry! I was being pretty casual when I said it, and...!」
Touko
「Ahahah! I'm kidding! No need to get so flustered.」
She's teasing me like she always does.
But something's different from usual.
It feels like she's one step further away from me.
...Maybe it was a mistake to try to go a little further?
Touko
「I'm going to go home soon. Why don't you go too?」
％Ｂ
「I'm... gonna come again tomorrow. Could you wait for me here?」
Touko
「...Mm. If I feel like it.」
I doubt just pressing forward is going to work out well.
I feel like it'd just end with Yukimura escaping like she's already done in the past.
Touko
「...I'm okay with living up to my name.」
％Ｂ
「Hm? What do you mean?」
Touko
「Being invisible is easy. It's always been this way for me.」
Yukimura doesn't try to become deeply involved with anyone.
I'm apparently the closest person to her in the entire school, but... I don't feel particularly close.

Touko
「Now then, is that all you wanted to talk about? I think I might wanna go home, then.」

％Ｂ
「You got something to do?」
Touko
「More or less. A bit of stuff at home.」
％Ｂ
「...Nothing you can do about that, then.」
Touko
「I'll lock up when I leave. You go home first.」
％Ｂ
「...All right. I'll go. Could you... wait for me here tomorrow again?」

Touko
「...Mm. If I feel like it.」
She's not coming out...
I've been waiting for over thirty minutes now, but I still haven't seen her.
Sora
「...What are you doing?」
％Ｂ
「Huh? Ousaka? Hey, you see Yukimura?」
Sora
「I did, over there. I saw Tou leaving through the back gates from the rooftop. I think she left.」


％Ｂ
「Th-The back gates!?」
Th-That really gets me down!
She was clearly avoiding me! That's really depressing!
Sora
「...Depressed?」
％Ｂ
「No, I'm fine... It's nothing.」
Sora
「But you seem down. Just a second... Mm. I'll give you this, so cheer up.」

％Ｂ
「Hm? This is... candy?」
Sora
「It's really good. Cute shape too. I like them.」
％Ｂ
「...Thanks.」
I tear open the packaging and put the candy in my mouth. The refreshing taste of lemon wafts across my palate.

Sora
「...How is it? Good?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. I get it, it's lemon flavored 'cause it's star-shaped and yellow.」
Natsuki
「Oh? What are you two doing here?」
all
Sora
「I gave him candy. Here's some for you two as well.」
Marika
「Wow, these are so cute. Thanks, Ousaka-san.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
Natsuki
「You sure do love stars. Oh, this is good.」
all
We all eat the candies.
I haven't had candy in a while. The flavor seems somehow special.

Natsuki
「So why were you giving out candy?」

Sora
「
Ryou 
He 
was depressed. I wanted to cheer him up.」

Natsuki
「Ahh... I see. So that's what happened.」
Sora
「...? What do you mean?」
Natsuki
「Sora, let's go home together today.」
Natsuki
「Marika, you handle 
Hino
him
, okay?」
Marika
「I see, so that's what happened.」
I told Shinozaki about what happened in the old school building.\n \n\r
About how I told Yukimura how I feel about her, and suggested we be in charge of the old school building together, and how she deftly turned me away.

％Ｂ
「What's that mean to you, as a fellow girl? Maybe I don't have a chance after all...?」
Marika
「I don't think that's true. Yukimura-san didn't give you a clear "I'm sorry, but no," did she?」

％Ｂ
「...No, she didn't.」
Marika
「It'll be okay. Just look at how honest your feelings for her are. You can't give up that easily.」

％Ｂ
「Shinozaki...」
Marika
「I'm sure it'll work out, so do your best, okay? You'll never be able to communicate how you feel if you give up.」

％Ｂ
「...Thanks. I'm glad you were here for this, Shinozaki.」
Marika
「Ehehe. Listening to you talk about this is the least I could do after I wasn't much help the other day.」

％Ｂ
「Segawa and Ousaka were worried about me too... I'll have to do something to thank you guys later.」
Marika
「No, you don't need to worry about that. I'm helping you because I want to.」

％Ｂ
「What?」
Marika
「You've always helped me in the past, right? It's not exactly as repayment for that... but this time, it's my turn to help you.」

％Ｂ
「...」
A question comes to mind as I muse over Shinozaki's kindness.
I have Shinozaki and the others helping me like this.
But what about Yukimura?
Does she have someone to go to for advice? Someone to talk things over with?
Is she bottling up all of my feelings that I've communicated to her, all on her own?
Marika
「...What's the matter?」
％Ｂ
「Oh, uh... I was just thinking about something.」
Marika
「What were you thinking about? Is that... something you can tell me about?」
％Ｂ
「I was just wondering... if Yukimura's got someone she can talk to like this.」
Marika
「That's a good question... Being all alone must be lonely... I wish I could be there for Yukimura-san too.」

％Ｂ
「I might be the one causing her problems, but I feel the same way. She'd probably want other girls as friends too... Could you try reaching out to her?」


Marika
「Okay. I'll try inviting her to hang out some time.」
all
Shinozaki and the others really helped me out.
I want to successfully get my feelings across to Yukimura...
％Ｂ
「Wonder if Shinozaki's managed to get Yukimura to hang out with her.」
The first hurdle's gonna be getting Yukimura to respond at all...
I don't think I have any reason to worry on that front, since Shinozaki would probably just keep trying anyway...

％Ｂ
「...Maybe I should try asking her to hang out too.」
It'll be a date.
I wanna know more about Yukimura, and I want her to know more about me.
A proper date would be the best for that.
Though how am I gonna ask her...?
Should I just be upfront about it, or should I try to come up with an excuse?\n\r
The plan for the date itself is important of course, but it's hard to even get started.
Let's start with a bit of research.
I'll need to increase the number of weapons at my disposal before engaging in battle.
％Ｂ
「I think I'll go buy some travel magazines at the convenience store.」
I'll look stuff up on the internet based on what I find in the magazines.
I'll put together a plan that I think'll draw Yukimura's interest and go for another round with her.
