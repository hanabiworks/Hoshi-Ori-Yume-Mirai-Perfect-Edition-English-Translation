％Ｂ
「...Hello?」
Natsuki
『Sorry for calling so early in the morning!』
％Ｂ
「...Oh... Segawa, hey...」
Natsuki
『Oh, were you sleeping? Sorry again, I know it's the weekend!』
％Ｂ
「Nah... It's fine... What's up...?」
Natsuki
『Are you free today?』
％Ｂ
「Mm... I guess... I am, yeah... Fuaaahh...」
Natsuki
『Then could you go out with me for a bit?』
％Ｂ
「Go out...?」
Natsuki
『I... want to be together with you today...』
％Ｂ
「...」
％Ｂ
「W-Wait... What'd you just say?」
Natsuki
『Don't make me say it twice... Stupid.』
％Ｂ
「I-I'll apologize if I misheard... but you said you wanted to be together with me...?」

Natsuki
『How mean... You did hear me, then.』
Oh, crap... My heart's beating kinda fast.
Is Segawa asking me out on a date!?
Natsuki
『Can you come right now?』
％Ｂ
「O-Of course I can! I can leave right away! Where do I go? I'll go anywhere!」

Natsuki
『Okay... Then―』
Thirty minutes later...
％Ｂ
「...Why... Why school?」
I'm even wearing my uniform... even though today's the weekend...
Natsuki
「Morniiing!」
％Ｂ
「Y-Yo... Morning.」
Natsuki
「Sorry for making you come out on a weekend!」
％Ｂ
「It's fine... So, just checking, but did you ask me to come here for a da―」
Natsuki
「Mkay, here. Hold onto this.」
％Ｂ
「S-Sure...」
I obediently take the bag she hands me.
Natsuki
「This too.」
％Ｂ
「Okay...」
Natsuki
「Let's get going, then.」
％Ｂ
「Right... Wait a second, where are we going?」
Natsuki
「The grounds. The game's starting soon.」
％Ｂ
「Game...?」
There's a practice game for the baseball club out on the grounds.
Natsuki
「Nice batting!」
％Ｂ
「H-Hey, Segawa... Why'd you ask me to come out―」
Natsuki
「Oh, the next batter's a leftie. Okay, let's move!」
％Ｂ
「Wha...?」
Natsuki
「C'mon, grab the bags! Hurry up and follow me!」
all
％Ｂ
「R-Right...!」
I pick up the things Segawa handed me earlier and run after her.
％Ｂ
「Wh-Where are we going?」
We circle around the backstop and end up on the third-base side of the benches.
Natsuki
「Phew... We made it in time.」
She points her camera at the batter.
You can see the leftie batter's expression better from this angle.
all
Umpire
「Strike!」
Natsuki
「Come on, I wanna get a good shot...」
％Ｂ
「H-Hey... Did we move just now 'cause you wanted to get a shot of the leftie's face...?」

Natsuki
「That's right. You can't see anything but his back from where we were earlier.」
％Ｂ
「So then... Did you ask me to come because...」
Because she wanted someone to carry her stuff around every time she moved...?
all
Umpire
「Strike!」
％Ｂ
「...」
Which means I'm just here as her assistant, like usual...
Umpire
「Strike! You're out!」
Natsuki
「Aghh, what the heck are you doiiing...?」
％Ｂ
「...」
Seriously, what the heck am I doing...? I came to school on a weekend after somehow convincing myself this was going to be a date...

％Ｂ
「Sigh...」
...Well, whatever.
I'm here because Segawa's relying (?) on me...

It's not just the two of us alone together again like that time in the inner courtyard, but relaxing and watching a baseball game isn't too―

Natsuki
「What are you spacing out for? The next batter's a rightie again, so we need to move back!」

％Ｂ
「R-Right...!」
I take that back!
This isn't relaxing at all!
Umpire
「Safe!」
Natsuki
「Okay, now it's two outs, and the bases are loaded! And now it's his turn to bat. It's the perfect scene!」

％Ｂ
「...His turn?」
Segawa expectantly looks at the batter's box.
She's clearly acting differently from when the others stepped up to bat so far. Seeing her expression makes me feel a little anxious.

all
Umpire
「Strike!」
Natsuki
「Come on! That was the perfect pitch just now! What are you letting that by for!? Keep your eyes on the ball!」

Her words seem a lot more familiar than before.
Umpire
「Strike!」
Natsuki
「And that was clearly going to be a ball! What are you swinging for! How about you show me your cool side a bit!」

％Ｂ
「H-Hey... Is this another request or something? Like, someone wants you to take photos of that batter...」

Natsuki
「Hm? No, it's not for a request. I just want to take photos of him.」

Segawa personally wants to take photos of that guy...?
So then... Does that mean she...?
Wait, but she already said she'd rather be more direct about it...

Umpire
「Strike! You're out!」
Natsuki
「Aghhh! You fanned on three pitches! What the heck are you doing!? I can't believe Minami bats fourth when he bats like that.」

％Ｂ
「...Minami? Wait... That's Minami? From our class...?」
Natsuki
「What, you only just realized?」
％Ｂ
「No, it was 'cause he was wearing a helmet... Oh... So he's in the baseball club...」

Yeah, now that I think about it, I feel like he's pretty much the only guy in our class with a shaved head...
Natsuki
「Minami's the star of the baseball team who's been fourth batter since last year. That's why I came here to get some cool batting shots of him for the grad-album...」


％Ｂ
「...Oh, so that's why?」
Natsuki
「Hey! Minami! I'm gonna put a photo of you sleeping in class and drooling all over yourself in the grad-album if you strike out like that again!」

Minami apparently can hear Segawa's heckling, because he puts his hands together and starts desperately lowering his head in apology.

Natsuki
「Phew... So what were we talking about again?」
％Ｂ
「Uh... Oh, well... G-Good luck, Minamiii...」
all
％Ｂ
「All right! The bases are loaded again!」
Two outs, bases loaded, bottom of the ninth.
The team can make a comeback if the next batter nails a long hit.
And that batter is―
％Ｂ
「Minami...」
He doesn't look the part of a fourth batter at all.
In stark contrast to Minami's grim expression, the pitcher seems relatively confident, despite the loaded bases.

Which makes sense, considering Minami's been up to bat three times now, and he's fanned three pitches every time.
I can't help but feel sorry for him.
％Ｂ
「It'd be great if he could hit it this time... Right?」
Natsuki
「...」
I look beside me. Segawa must've finally given up trying to take photos of him at this point, because she's looking through the photos she's already taken on her camera.

％Ｂ
「Aren't you gonna take pictures of him?」
Natsuki
「...」
％Ｂ
「Hey, Segawa?」
Natsuki
「...I've got it!」
％Ｂ
「Uh... Got what?」
Umpire
「Striiike!」
Agh, Minami's already gotten a strike...
Natsuki
「Time oooooout!」
％Ｂ
「Huh?」
Umpire
「Time out! ...Wait, what?」
The umpire looks a little confused at the time out that got called from somewhere other than the benches.
Everyone on both teams and the audience is looking our way, completely flabbergasted.

Natsuki
「
Hino, go 
Go 
deliver a message real quick.」
％Ｂ
「M-Me? Wait, is that okay? And what message?」
Natsuki
「It's the reason why Minami's doing so badly. Here, look at this.」
She shows me her camera's screen.
Natsuki
「This is a photo I took of his stance last time, and this is today's. Look, see how his left elbow's about a fist's width lower?」

％Ｂ
「Uhh... Now that you mention it, you're right.」
Natsuki
「Go tell Minami that.」
％Ｂ
「G-Got it.」
all
Is it okay to do something like this?
There's no way it is...
But Segawa's actually somehow managed to pause the match, so...
％Ｂ
「A-Arghh, whatever!」
I run up to Minami in the batter's box, tell him what Segawa said, and then run back.

Natsuki
「Did you tell him?」
％Ｂ
「Y-Yeah... I did. Minami looked pretty lost at first, but he looked like he got it when I told him about his elbow. I guess he didn't even realize it himself.」

Natsuki
「Now let's see...」
Segawa peers at Minami through her camera.
Natsuki
「Okay... He's back to his stance from before! I think we might see something good now!」

％Ｂ
「He better do something, after I had to go out and do that...!」
all
Crack!!!
％Ｂ
「There it is!」
Natsuki
「It's gone!」
Minami hits the ball far, and it keeps going way above the outfield.

％Ｂ
「He did it! It's a home run with the bases loaded!」
Natsuki
「Looks like Minami had it in him!」
Minami looks our way while he's rounding the bases, and triumphantly raises his fist in the air.

all
Our school ended up winning after that home run.

％Ｂ
「That was amazing, though.」
Natsuki
「It really was. I guess he hasn't been fourth batter for that long for no reason.」

％Ｂ
「Well, Minami was amazing too, but I was more talking about you, Segawa.」

Natsuki
「Huh? Me? Why?」
％Ｂ
「I'm surprised you noticed just a fist's width worth of difference. Most people wouldn't.」
Natsuki
「Really? That's not true. It's obvious once you compare the photos.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, but only if you were able to take the time to thoroughly look through the photos knowing there's a difference, like some kind of spot-the-difference puzzle.」

％Ｂ
「It's already amazing that you saw there was something wrong with his stance, and it's even more amazing that you were able to pinpoint a small, specific difference on top of that. I think it's something only you could've done.」


Natsuki
「Y-You think so? Man, getting compliments like that kinda makes me blush, ahaha...」

Natsuki
「...But if that was amazing, then it isn't because of me. It's photos that are amazing.」

％Ｂ
「Photos?」
Natsuki
「They don't just let the past leave its mark. They can even connect to the future. I honestly think photos are amazing for being able to do that, and that's why they're so interesting.」


％Ｂ
「I get it...」
I think I see her in a new light once more now that she's said that.
That's not something you could come up with, unless you were really passionate about photography...

％Ｂ
「You're really serious when it comes to photos, huh.」
Natsuki
「The heck's that supposed to mean? Don't say it like I'm not serious about anything else otherwise.」

She jokingly pouts at me.
％Ｂ
「By the way, how'd you get into photography in the first place?」

Natsuki
「Mm... I wonder why? I don't remember anymore.」
％Ｂ
「What the heck...」
Natsuki
「But if you wanna know why I'm still doing it, then I can tell you. I have photos I want to take. I do photography to take those photos.」


％Ｂ
「What photos do you wanna take?」
Natsuki
「Well there's kids, right? And animals, right? And the ocean and the sky and mountains... I want to take photos of anything and everything I see and feel.」

％Ｂ
「That's a whole lot. So then what's the one thing you want to take a photo of most?」
Natsuki
「A photo that'll make everyone's wishes come true... I guess.」
％Ｂ
「...That's pretty abstract. And it seems like it'd be a hard photo to get.」
Natsuki
「That's not true.」
Segawa points her finger toward the sky and starts drawing circles in the air as she speaks.
Natsuki
「A photo is for someone who wishes to never forget their memories... There are people who wish on photos for their own success, and there are people who wish for happiness too...」


Natsuki
「Photos are pretty much the embodiment of people's determination. I want to be able to take that determination and give it lasting form.」

Natsuki
「That's why I think a photo that makes wishes come true is more realistic than you'd expect, and a lot simpler than you'd imagine... probably.」

％Ｂ
「Probably, huh?」
Natsuki
「Probably's fine. Because it wouldn't be fun if I could take a photo like that right away, right?」

％Ｂ
「Is that how it works...?」
I don't really understand what the "photo that makes wishes come true" that Segawa's talking about really is.

But it's obvious to me that she's made that her goal, and she's doing everything she can to direct her passion toward photography for it.

％Ｂ
「Yeah. You really are serious when it comes to photography.」
Natsuki
「Whaaat... I'm always serious, though.」
She shows me a carefree smile in response to what I said.
