Lunch break the next day.
％Ｂ
「Now then, let's see how that water tank turned out...」
I put water in the tank this morning after letting it sit for a whole day.
If there's no issue, then all that's left would be to just make more tanks using the same method...

Marika
「Awawawawa...」
％Ｂ
「Hm? Was that Shinozaki?」
I can hear running water when I walk in.
Shinozaki's looking around frantically in front of the water tank.
％Ｂ
「Shinozaki! What happened!?」
Marika
「Oh...! There's a problem with the water tank～!」

The issue is immediately apparent.
Water's leaking from the tank.
There's a big puddle of water on the ground. Looks like it's a pretty major leak.
％Ｂ
「Where's it leaking from?」
all
I look to see that it's coming out where two of the glass panes meet.
Shinozaki's got her hands pressed tightly against it, desperately trying to stop the flow of water.

Marika
「Auuuh, it's not stopping～～～」
She's soaking wet because of it.
％Ｂ
「Using your hands isn't gonna work, Shinozaki. Let's scoop out the water from inside the tank with buckets for now.」

Marika
「O-Okay!」
all
％Ｂ
「...It looks like it's because of the caulk.」
We put water inside again after an emergency repair, to see what the problem was.

I figured it out from watching the tank.
It looks like water seeped into the caulk and weakened it.

But how?
The caulk should've hardened completely.
Misa
「That was quite the problem... It's a good thing you noticed right away.」


Touko
「I'm tired, but it would've been a huge issue if we got this all wet.」

Okihara-senpai and Yukimura showed up right after that, and we all worked together to get the water out of the tank.

％Ｂ
「Yes. It was a good thing Shinozaki was there.」
all
Marika
「I was just frantically running around...」
all
Touko
「But... does this mean that the tank-building failed?」
％Ｂ
「No, I don't think we need to give up yet. Not like we have any other way of getting tanks anyway.」

all
We'll have to do it over, but first, I need to figure out why it failed.
If we just remake it now, there's a high chance that things'll end up the same way.
But before that...
We need to do something about Shinozaki.
She's soaking wet from getting covered in the water from the tank.
Marika
「...Hepch!」
Touko
「Mm? What was that? A sneeze?」
Marika
「Ahaha, I might've gotten a little cold～ But I'm sure I'll dry off right away, since it's hot today.」

Misa
「Still, it wouldn't do for you to stay this way. We still have classes...」

Marika
「I have my jersey, so I'll go change into that. I'm sure my clothes will be dry by the time we need to leave...」


Touko
「But isn't your underwear wet too?」
Marika
「Ah, uuuh～ ...Well, it is...」
％Ｂ
「That's gotta be cold, right? I know it's summer, but that's still not good for you.」

all
I hear girls shouldn't let their bodies get cold, too.
Plus, Shinozaki doesn't exactly have a rugged body.
Marika
「But I don't have any to change into...」
％Ｂ
「All right! I'll go run and grab a change of clothes for you.」
Marika
「What? Run and grab... From my house?」
％Ｂ
「There's no other option, is there? I'll go run over, so you let your mom know and have her prepare some clothes to change into.」


Marika
「But it'll take a while to get to my house, you know. You won't be able to get back before the end of lunch break...」

％Ｂ
「I'll borrow a bike from someone. I can burn rubber on that and make it in time.」

Marika
「I don't think you need to go that far～ ...Really, I'll be fine.」

％Ｂ
「No, it's my fault that you got wet.」
This wouldn't have happened if I had made the tank better.
We're lucky that someone getting wet was all that happened. This might've ended up terribly if something else had gone wrong.

If this were a building instead of a water tank...
And more than anything, Shinozaki's frail. There's no way it'd be good for her to be wet like that.

％Ｂ
「Don't worry. I'll be careful about it.」
Marika
「Careful? ...Really?」
％Ｂ
「Really. I swear I'll be careful.」
Marika
「...Okay. I'll tell my mom, then...」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, please. I'm going, then!」

％Ｂ
「Hahh, hahh, hahh... I'm finally here.」
Going as fast as I can on a granny bike's pretty tough... I feel like my leg muscles might be about to pop.

Yumi
「
Oh, Hino-kun? 
Oh? 
Perfect timing.」
Shinozaki's mom comes out.
Yumi
「You came on a bike, right? That was quick.」
％Ｂ
「I was pedaling as hard as I could... It's my fault Shinozaki got wet... I'm sorry.」

Yumi
「It's just water. She works part-time at the pool, so it's fine.」

％Ｂ
「Well, that's true... but Shinozaki's health is...」

Yumi
「Fufu... It's fine. But thank you.」

Yumi
「Here then, a change of clothes. Her underwear's in there too, so no peeking, okay?」

％Ｂ
「What? I-I won't peek!」
Yumi
「Well, you can peek just a little.」
％Ｂ
「I said I won't! Anyway, I need to get back before the end of lunch break, so...」

I take the bag and pull a U-turn on the bike.
Yumi
「Be careful now. It's okay to be late for classes.」

％Ｂ
「No, I don't think that's okay at all... Anyway, thank you very much!」

％Ｂ
「You think you can do it?」
I call out to Shinozaki as she changes in the bathroom.
Lunch break is almost over.
Marika
「J-Just a little longer!」
％Ｂ
「Oh, there! The bell rang!」
Marika
「S-Sorry for the wait!」
％Ｂ
「All right, we made it in time. Time to run to class. Wouldn't wanna be late. Both of us!」


Marika
「O-Okay! U-Umm～ ...B-Before that...」

％Ｂ
「Hm? What?」
Marika
「Th-Thanks...」
％Ｂ
「Nah, I'm the one who should be apologizing instead. I'll figure out what went wrong.」

Marika
「I think it'll go well next time. Good luck.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah. Leave it to me!」
all
But still... What on earth was the issue?

％Ｂ
「...It was the type of caulk.」
I've figured it out after looking things up on the internet.
There's caulk that's specifically for making water tanks, and it's apparently got different waterproofing properties from normal caulk.

There's also the issue of it being something that could come into contact with living creatures. Normal caulk isn't necessarily guaranteed to be safe on that front either, so it was just an all-around bad choice.


％Ｂ
「It might've been a good thing that the tank failed...」
We might've ended up doing a terrible job if we had just gone ahead and used those.
I need to get the idea that we're making something to hold precious life in my head.\n\r

We're utter novices that don't know anything.
Once I face that fact head-on, I feel like I can see what exactly I need to do next.

％Ｂ
「Never let yourself get complacent... Okay!」

％Ｂ
「Is it okay if I move this model to the side a bit?」
Azuma
「Yeah, I don't mind.」
I carefully move the model aside and clean up the area.
％Ｂ
「There's quite a lot of dust. You need to make sure to clean regularly.」

I cleaned it pretty thoroughly the first time I was here, but it's back to the way it was already.

Azuma
「I've been busy lately... Still, you must really like cleaning to just barge in and demand to clean up.」


％Ｂ
「Ahaha, I really am. Cleaning's pretty much my only real hobby...」

Azuma
「Or maybe you have some ulterior motive for it.」
He narrows his eyes at me. I reflexively freeze.
％Ｂ
「I'm sorry. Actually... there's something I'd like some advice on.」

Azuma
「Let's at least hear it, then. You can continue the cleanup afterward.」

％Ｂ
「Thank you very much. So...」
all
I tell him the gist of our situation.
Azuma
「Tanabata Festival, eh? Now that takes me back.」
He smiles gently.
He must have some good memories associated with the Tanabata Festival.
Azuma
「I remember putting in a lot of work for the Tanabata Festival myself. Made a huge bamboo decoration with friends and stuff. Still, a stargazing aquarium? That's quite the idea.」


％Ｂ
「It's just how things turned out... and so, the water tanks...」

Mr. Azuma designed Marinpia Shionagi. I'm sure he must know something about water tank construction.

It's dangerous to move ahead with only the considerations of an amateur.
Fish are alive, and if the water tanks break while they're on display, then someone could get hurt.

To be honest, I'm filled with doubts after seeing Shinozaki soaking wet yesterday.

Azuma
「It's a good decision. I'm just an architect, not a specialist on water tanks... but I'm sure I can answer a few things.」


Azuma
「So what are you worried about?」
％Ｂ
「It's the water tanks. We're running on a tight budget, and we don't have much in the way of resources either, so I thought we could try making them ourselves...」


Azuma
「And you screwed up right away, right?」
He laughs.
I guess he must've seen that coming.
％Ｂ
「Yes. Water leaked through the caulk. Is there caulk that's used specifically for water tanks?」

Azuma
「I dunno about for tanks specifically... but if you used typical caulk, then it was probably an oxime type. Those are good for most uses, but they're not waterproof.」


Azuma
「It won't be an issue for most domestic uses, but it's a different story for water tanks. I'd recommend an acetate variety, but I doubt they sell those at your average store.」


％Ｂ
「Is there a way a normal person could obtain some? And about the price...」

Azuma
「Just wait a second. Heeey, someone who's free, come over here!」

He calls out toward one of the staff members in the back.
Azuma
「Remember that engineering firm we got to know back when we made Marinpia? Right, the one with the president who was crazy about tropical fish...」

Ohh, a tropical-fish-crazy president?
Azuma
「Could you contact them for me? Tell him there's a student who wants some caulk for making water tanks, and ask if he could lend him some.」


％Ｂ
「That'd be so helpful! Thank you so very much!」

Azuma
「Now, now. This is just me contributing to a local event.」
％Ｂ
「I'll continue cleaning, then! I'll make it crazy clean!」

all
I knew it was a good idea to come here for advice.
I think we'll be able to move forward now.
