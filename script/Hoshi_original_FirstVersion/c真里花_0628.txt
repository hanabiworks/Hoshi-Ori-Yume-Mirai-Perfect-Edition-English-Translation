That's right. I brought Shinozaki tanzaku that day.
We got lots of tanzaku for the Tanabata Festival in class, and I went to Shinozaki's place after school to give them to her, since she was absent that day too.

Marika
「Tanabata Festival? So it's already that time of year.」
％Ｂ
「That's right. So you gotta hurry and get better.」
Marika
「Ahaha～ ...You're right.」
％Ｂ
「You should write lots of wishes. That's why I brought lots of tanzaku.」

There were lots left over after everyone wrote their wishes, so I brought as many as I could carry.

Marika
「...Isn't this too many?」
％Ｂ
「Just write lots of wishes. Here, it doesn't matter what you write, just start writing.」

Marika
「Whaaat? I don't know if I can write this many. You help too
, Hino-kun

.」
％Ｂ
「Me? But I already wrote mine at school and turned them in.」
Marika
「We can just put them up at my house, then. We'll put bamboo up in my room too. It's better to make lots of wishes, right?」


％Ｂ
「Well... You're right. I'll write too, then!」

And so the two of us filled out lots of tanzaku.
We wrote tons of totally pointless wishes on them.
Like wanting to eat ground beef steak for dinner, or wishing for no homework tomorrow.

Marika
「Mmm, I don't know if I have any more～」
％Ｂ
「Just one left. I'll do this one, then.」
Marika
「But we sure wrote a lot～」
％Ｂ
「What'd you write?」
There was a mountain of tanzaku on top of the bed.
I grabbed a random one from the pile and looked at it.
Marika
「Oh, I'd like if you didn't look～ ...I didn't write anything that important.」

％Ｂ
「Uh...」
My heart froze.
"I wish that I could grow up."
That's what was written on the tanzaku.
My heart froze because it was something that I had taken for granted.
I had thought that no one would need to wish to grow up. That it was obvious that it would happen to everyone.

But that was an incredibly precious wish for Shinozaki.
Marika
「What? Which one was that one?」
％Ｂ
「...Oh, uh... Something about eating something tasty...」
I just couldn't bring myself to say the truth, so I just said something random.
Marika
「Ohh, about eating pudding or something? Ahaha, that's embarrassing～」

％Ｂ
「Man, we wrote lots of stupid stuff. Let's add one last one, then.」

On my last one...
I wrote:
"I wish for Shinozaki to become a healthy adult."
Marika
「What did you write?」
％Ｂ
「I wished that you'd be able to eat pudding.」
Marika
「Whaaat? You should've wished for yourself.」
％Ｂ
「It's fine. I couldn't think of anything anyway. I'll go hang this up, then.」

I left my other tanzaku behind...
And secretly hung up that one, final tanzaku on the bamboo.

Marika
「There aren't many fish today～」
We've come to get more tropical fish today, but we haven't had much luck.
％Ｂ
「Yeah, seriously... Oh, it's those kids again.」
％Ｂ
「I'm gonna go play with them a bit.」
Marika
「Ahahaha, have fun!」
all
Rikuto
「Whaaat? You haven't caught much at all!」
I'm immediately surrounded.
Miyuki
「Boriiing!」
The kids are completely familiar with us by now, and they seem pretty bored.
Miyuki
「Maybe there's a lot more fish near the ocean, instead of these puddles?」

Itsuki
「Wow, you're so smart!」
Rikuto
「Let's go check it out right now!」
％Ｂ
「Come on, now. It's dangerous over there.」
Rikuto
「Leeeet meee goooo!」
％Ｂ
「People who act like that... get this!」
Rikuto
「Gyahahahaha! Stoooop tickliiing meee!」

I have no choice but to play with the kids.
But this is fun in its own way.
％Ｂ
「Ow, ow, ow... That kid seriously put up a fight.」
Marika
「It looked like fun.」
Marika
「But it looks like everyone's a bit disappointed.」
The kids are sulkily looking into the tide pools.

Misa
「These days happen. It is simply a matter of course when nature is involved.」

％Ｂ
「Maybe we could try changing locations a bit?」
Misa
「Let's see... I asked a local the other day, but there is apparently a little-known spot over there. Perhaps we could try over there?」


all
Rikuto
「Hey, are you guys going somewhere?」
The boys come running over to us, apparently having overheard our conversation.

Itsuki
「I'll go too, then!」
Misa
「I'm very sorry. Our next destination is dangerous, as it has bad footing. So could I please have you stay here and wait for us?」


Miyuki
「Whaaat?」

Marika
「Then I'll play with you guys here. It'll be a race to see who finds fish first, us or them, okay?」


Rikuto
「Yeah, yeah! Let's race!」
％Ｂ
「Sure thing. We're not gonna lose.」
Misa
「Then Marika-san, I leave them to you.」
％Ｂ
「We'll be going, then.」
Marika
「Yeah. Be careful～」
％Ｂ
「It looks like this spot isn't that great today either.」
We took a look through the spot that Okihara-senpai apparently learned about from a local fisherman, but without much success.

It might just be the same everywhere today.
Maybe I should've just stayed over there, then?
Is Shinozaki okay?
Misa
「At this rate, it may have been fine for me to come here by myself. You're worried about Marika-san, aren't you?」

％Ｂ
「Huh?」
％Ｂ
「...Shinozaki?」
I give a start when she voices my own thoughts.
％Ｂ
「No, she's just watching those kids anyway. There's nothing to worry about. It's not like Shinozaki's a kid either.」


Misa
「Is that so? It seems to me that you're worried.」

％Ｂ
「Does... it seem that way?」
Do I look like I'm worried?
I mean, I am worried, but...
Misa
「You know Marika-san from back when you lived here, yes?」
％Ｂ
「Yes. Just a bit, back when we were kids. We were classmates.」

Misa
「Is that... all?」
％Ｂ
「What? Is that... Yes, it is?」
Misa
「But when I watch the two of you, I can sense a deeper bond, one that goes beyond just friendship.」

％Ｂ
「You sense... a bond?」
％Ｂ
「I don't really think I understand... but it's not like I have that deep a relationship with Shinozaki.」

Misa
「Is that so?」
％Ｂ
「We've only just met for the first time in years, and hadn't seen each other at all in that time... We pretty much only sent each other New Year's cards.」


％Ｂ
「And I know I said we were classmates when we were kids, but Shinozaki couldn't come to school much because she was always sick, so it's not like we spent that much time together either.」


Misa
「I see, I see. So Marika-san was frail.」

％Ｂ
「She had some debilitating asthma, and couldn't go to school much at all.」
Misa
「I certainly can't imagine that, seeing her now. It's very good that she got better.」

She smiles gently.
But I can't return that smile.
Misa
「...Or perhaps she hasn't gotten better yet?」
％Ｂ
「Oh, no, she has... apparently. But I'm still worried...」

I said it without thinking.
Even though I hadn't intended on saying anything like that.
all
％Ｂ
「I guess, inside of me, I still think Shinozaki's the same she was back then... I can't get that image of her stuck in bed, wearing pajamas, out of my head...」

It might be weird of me to think that way, since I only ever had contact with her through New Year's cards for a long time.

％Ｂ
「I always brought her printouts from class. I drew on the backs of them, because I wanted to cheer her up, even a little. Maybe that's why.」


％Ｂ
「I was just always worried about her. I felt like I had to do something...」

Misa
「Her asthma was very serious, after all.」
％Ｂ
「Yes, it was.」
"I wish that I could grow up."
It was so serious that she would wish that on a tanzaku.
Her asthma caused her to miss so many important events in her childhood.
That's why, this Tanabata Festival for sure...
And the more I think of things that way, the more these worries that Shinozaki might disappear from me swell up inside.

Misa
「...」
％Ｂ
「I'm sorry for making you listen to something that doesn't concern you...」
Misa
「Oh, no. That wasn't why. Do you hear something?」

％Ｂ
「Huh? ...Now that you mention it.」
It's from far off, but I can hear what sounds like some kind of clamor.
It's coming from those rocks that we were at earlier.
I can see someone run toward us from there.
Misa
「Perhaps something happened?」
I've got a bad feeling about this.
all
％Ｂ
「Excuse me! What happened!?」
I call out to the person who's running toward us.
Fisher A
「A girl fell into the ocean!」
％Ｂ
「Wha...!? A girl?」
Fisher A
「I'm going to go call for help!」
Worry rises up in my chest.
A girl fell in the ocean. If Shinozaki fell in the ocean...
If she had an asthma attack then...
％Ｂ
「...! Shinozaki!?」
Misa
「Oh...!」
％Ｂ
「Shinozakiii! Shinozaki!!」
Misa
「Please wait! It's dangerous to get so frantic!」

I can barely hear Okihara-senpai.
I look for Shinozaki. I can't find her.
％Ｂ
「Shinozaki! Shinozakiii!!」
No matter how many times I call for her, there's no response.
％Ｂ
「Shinoza... Agh!!」
I feel an impact at my feet, and the next thing I know, I'm sprawled out on the rocks.

％Ｂ
「Ghhh...!」
But this isn't the time for me to be on the ground!
I force myself up and start running again.
I can't even hear Okihara-senpai's voice anymore.
Rikuto
「Onii-chaaan!」
Itsuki
「Waaaahhh!」
The boys run over to me.
They're crying.
％Ｂ
「What's wrong? Did something happen!?」
Rikuto
「Onee-chan, she, she...!」
％Ｂ
「...! What happened to Shinozaki!?」

Itsuki
「Waaaaaaaaaahnn...!」
He points toward the sea as he cries.
I follow his finger with my gaze. My chest feels like it's about to explode.
％Ｂ
「Oh...」
Over where the kids are pointing...
Is Shinozaki.
She's holding a soaking wet girl in her arms.
Shinozaki's smiling.
She's doing everything she can to comfort the crying girl in her arms.
Marika
「It's okay. Don't worry, okay?」
Miyuki
「Hgh... Fueeeeehhhh... Waaaaaahhh～」

Marika
「I know you were scared. It happened so suddenly, didn't it? But it's okay now. See, I'm here now too.」


Miyuki
「Hicc... Hgh... Fueeeehhh...」
％Ｂ
「Shinozaki...」
Marika
「Oh...! 
Hino-kun? 
？
What's wrong?」
％Ｂ
「What? What do you mean, what's wrong? What even happened...?」

Marika
「These kids were curious about the ocean. They got too excited, and she fell in... Sorry, I should've been watching more closely...」


％Ｂ
「She... was the one who fell in...」
I see now...
So by "girl," they didn't mean Shinozaki...
Marika
「But it's okay. Some people who were fishing nearby helped, and we pulled her up.」

％Ｂ
「Really... Is she hurt? What about you?」
Marika
「Nope. We're both okay.」
％Ｂ
「Phew...」
...Thank god.
I go limp in relief.
％Ｂ
「...Urgh?」
And at the same time, I feel pain shoot up from my foot.
％Ｂ
「Wha...What?」
Marika
「W-Wah!? Your leg... It's bleeding!」
I look down to see blood coming out from my shin.

Misa
「Are you okay? Oh no, there's so much...!」
％Ｂ
「N-No, there's no need to worry. I think it's just a small scratch, so...」

all
％Ｂ
「...Oww!?」
I feel another spike of pain when I try to stand.
％Ｂ
「Gghhhhhhhhh～」
It hurts badly enough that I can't fake being fine.
Or more like, I can't even stand...
Marika
「You shouldn't try to stand up! I think someone will be here soon... Oh... an ambulance?」


I can hear a siren from far away.
That person from earlier might've called for it.
Marika
「Um... Maybe you should have them take a look at you too.」

％Ｂ
「N-No... I'm fine...」
Misa
「You shouldn't move!」
％Ｂ
「...!?」
Misa
「You're sweating so much... Please stay still... You must rest.」

I realize that I'm covered in a cold sweat. More sweat than I've ever experienced before.\n\r

What is this pain?
But, I'm glad Shinozaki and the girl are safe.
So glad...
