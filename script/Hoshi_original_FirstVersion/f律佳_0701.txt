Music Teacher
「Okay, you pass. You're last to go
, Hino-kun

.」
％Ｂ
「Okay!」
I stand up. My voice is dry from nervousness.
It's time to retake my music practical exam.
I'll fail for real if I don't do well here. But it should be fine as long as I use everything I've learned in my lessons with Narusawa.

...But I'm still used to being terrible at music, so I can't help but get a little nervous.

Rikka
「...Sensei. May I ask a question?」
Everyone in class looks at Narusawa when she raises her hand.
Music Teacher
「What would that be, Narusawa-san?」
Rikka
「May I take the test again, as a pair with 
Hino-kun
％Ａ-kun
?」
％Ｂ
「Narusawa?」
Music Teacher
「But you have already passed this test...」
It's like she says.
There's no point in retaking the exam when she's already passed.
And then I come to a certain conclusion after some thought.
Rikka
「I do not mind if you negate the previous exam. I would like to retake it with the piano.」

Rikka
「I was able to pass with singing before, but it was not a performance I myself was satisfied with. If he fails, then I am also fine failing.」

Music Teacher
「I understand. If you insist, Narusawa-san... 
Hino-kun, are 
Are 
you okay with this?」
％Ｂ
「Yes.」
Rikka
「Thank you very much.」
all
Our music teacher eventually relents and allows us to take the test as a pair.
I talk to Narusawa as I pass her on her way to the piano.
％Ｂ
「Thanks. I was a bit worried doing it on my own, to be honest. This really helps.」
Rikka
「Let's do it like we've practiced.」
all
She seats herself on the piano bench.
Seeing her assume her usual posture fills me with reassurance.
Rikka
「...」
Narusawa seems unusually nervous as she places her fingers on the keys.
I might have transmitted what little anxiety I have left to her.
I take a single deep set of breaths, and look at her to signal I'm ready.
She begins to glide her fingers across the keys, and I begin to sing.

......
...
Narusawa's piano playing was just as stunning as ever.
Her singing from before was amazing too, but her showcasing her incredible amount of ability pulled not just the students, but the teacher too, into the music...

And so I was able to pass the practical exam without incident thanks to Narusawa.
Starting today, after-school activities are to be put on hold throughout the school in preparation for exams.

...That's what Shuuichi told me over LIME.
I guess that means I should hurry up and go home to study.
Fortunately, the Tanabata Festival preparations are progressing smoothly, so there's no need to get too hung up over missing a week's worth of work.

But we still have to take care of all of the fish we have, so we all discussed and decided who would come in on what days.
Okihara-senpai and Ousaka are going to be feeding the fish today, which means I'm free.
So there's only one thing to do.
％Ｂ
「Narusawa. Let's go home together.」
Rikka
「Oh, I'm sorry. I really wish I could, but...」
％Ｂ
「Got something to do?」
Natsuki
「Rikka belongs to everyone. You don't get to monopolize her just because you're her boyfriend, okay?」

％Ｂ
「Ah, I get it.」

Looking closely, I can see Shinozaki hiding behind the classroom door... and even Yukimura.

The girls must be planning to go out together after this.

_00cutinBS
_00cutinBS
％Ｂ
「I'll go home with Shuuichi or something, then.」
Natsuki
「A depressing walk home with another guy, eh?」
％Ｂ
「I wanna go home with Narusawa, but there's nothing I can do about that. And it wouldn't be good if I went home with a girl other than Narusawa, right?」


Natsuki
「We'd all work together to lynch you if you did that, 'course.」
Seems the girls all have a tight bond.
％Ｂ
「Not like I even have anyone else to walk home with in the first place.」
％Ｂ
「Anyway, Shinozaki and Yukimura are waiting for you guys, right? Why don't you get going?」

Natsuki
「That's true. Let's go, Rikka.」

Rikka
「Okay. See you
, Hino-kun

.」
all
％Ｂ
「Yeah, later. I'll message you tonight.」
Rikka
「I'll be waiting.」
all
％Ｂ
「Let's see. Wonder if Shuuichi's still around.」
Shuuichi
「It's been a while since we've gone home together like this... Oh. You haven't already been dumped by Narusawa, have you?」

％Ｂ
「Why's that the first thing you think of! That'd be terrible!」

％Ｂ
「She's hanging out with Segawa and the others.」
Shuuichi
「And so you came to me because you couldn't go home with Narusawa.」
％Ｂ
「Did I make you feel bad?」
Shuuichi
「I don't care. I'm happy you've got a girlfriend.」
Shuuichi
「Living in the moment by playing soccer's nice, and it's excellent that you're being of use to others through the committee too.」

Shuuichi
「But you're a man, so you've gotta experience romance with the girl you like, right?」

％Ｂ
「I'm really feeling that right now.」
Shuuichi
「So how's it going? How are things progressing? You kiss at least already?」

％Ｂ
「Kiss... A kiss...」
all
I tried to do it immediately after we started dating, but I haven't tried again since she stopped me out of embarrassment.

We've held hands and linked arms, so I think it'd be fine to kiss next...

％Ｂ
「I dunno how you're supposed to do it, you know?」
Shuuichi
「What?」
％Ｂ
「I'm talking about kissing, man.」
Shuuichi
「It's a kiss. Just do it.」
％Ｂ
「I'm asking 'cause I can't do it. You know, like the timing and stuff.」
Shuuichi
「The timing, huh...」
％Ｂ
「Wouldn't be good if I tried it at a weird moment and creeped her out, right?」
Shuuichi
「I don't think it's anything to worry about, but yeah, I guess moments like those exist.」

Shuuichi
「Like just after you ate yakisoba and you've still got seaweed on your front teeth. That's especially awful.」

％Ｂ
「...Speaking from experience?」
Shuuichi
「...Don't ask. All I can say is that if you like someone, you're gonna wanna kiss them.」
Shuuichi
「You wouldn't wanna kiss someone you hate, no matter how the mood is. Right?」

％Ｂ
「You're right.」
Narusawa only said no for the moment because she was embarrassed. It's not like she said no to kissing in general.

I wonder if she'd let me do it if I tried again.
Shuuichi
「All right, then how about I tell you about my sugary-sweet first kissy-kissy with Kaori-san, my little lost lamb?」

Shuuichi
「It was during my second date with Kaori-san, when we went to the planetarium―」

Shuuichi
「The planetarium that's a little past the downtown area.」

Shuuichi
「Maybe it wasn't the right season or something, but it was pretty empty inside. We sat in seats that were away from the other guests.」
Shuuichi
「Kaori-san was so adorable when she shivered a bit and said, "It's warm spring weather outside, but it's a little chilly in here, isn't it?" that I wanted to warm her with my entire body.」

％Ｂ
「Hey. It's the planetarium. Other guests were there too. Can't do that in public.」

Shuuichi
「No, of course you can't... So I removed my jacket and placed it on Kaori-san's shoulders.」

％Ｂ
「That's unexpectedly cool of you.」
Shuuichi
「And then, "You're so nice, Shuuichi," her luscious, seductive lips moved... and that's when Kaori-san placed her hand over mine!」
％Ｂ
「That wasn't the kiss!? Why would you phrase it that way!?」
Shuuichi
「The kiss happened after we ate after we left the planetarium. It's not gonna be for a while.」

％Ｂ
「...So why did you start with the planetarium?」
Shuuichi
「It would be a disservice to neglect recounting even a moment of the passion in my tale.」
％Ｂ
「...Fine. Just keep going.」
I'm sure listening to other experiences should be useful.
And besides, he's doing this for me.

―And a few minutes later...
With heavy, heavy regrets in my heart over my decision to have him continue, I vow to never do anything similar to other people.
【Rikka】「The chocolate fondue #Nwas good. You take #Nfruits and roasted #Nmarshmallows and dip #Nthem into melted #Nchocolate.」
【％Ｂ】「Ohh yeah, that does #nsound good.」
【Rikka】「And then we got pizza #Ntoo.」
【％Ｂ】「Huh. A chocolate store #Nthat sells pizza?」
Narusawa apparently went to a chocolate-focused store that's only recently set up shop along the main street.

It's apparently a really popular place from overseas, and the Shionagi location's the third one in the entire country.

【Rikka】「They put chocolate #Nsauce and marshmallows #Non pizza dough. The #Nchocolate stretches #Nlike cheese when you #Ntear it.」
【％Ｂ】「So it's a sweet pizza? #NKinda hard to imagine.」
【Rikka】「It's hard to get away #Nfrom thinking of cheese #Nfor pizza, isn't it? #NIt's good if you think #Nof it as a new kind of #Nsweet altogether #Ninstead of pizza.」
【％Ｂ】「But I bet it'd be hard #Nfor me to go there. I #Nbet it's all girls.」
【Rikka】「I'd say it was about #N80% female, 20% male. I #Ndidn't see any boys who #Nwere there without a #Ngirl.」
【％Ｂ】「I bet...」
I'm sure there are lots of guys out there that like sweet things.
But it's not exactly an easy thing to say, societally.
I don't necessarily go out of my way to buy stuff like that, but I do like sweet things.

【Rikka】「But there were a lot of #ncouples.」
【％Ｂ】「I guess that'd be about #Nthe only way a guy #Ncould go.」
【Rikka】「Segawa-san was saying I #Nshould try being a part #Nof that population next #Ntime.」
...Hm?
As in, the population of couples?
Is she telling me she wants us to go together?
【％Ｂ】「How about we go #Ntogether sometime, #nthen? I wanna try #Neating that pizza too.」
【Rikka】「Okay. I'm looking forward to it.」
【Rikka】_st_0104
That's great. Looks like she's happy.
【Rikka】「Also, are you free #Ntomorrow?」
【％Ｂ】「Nothing other than #Nwanting to go home with #Nyou. Oh, unless you've #Ngot plans for tomorrow #Ntoo...」
【Rikka】「No, I don't. We were #Nall talking about #Ngetting together to #Nstudy for exams #Ntogether. Do you want #Nto come too?」
【％Ｂ】「Of course I do.」
【Rikka】「It'll be at my house, #Nso we can go together #Ntomorrow.」
【％Ｂ】_st_0310
【Rikka】「Also...」
【％Ｂ】「Hm?」
【Rikka】「No, nothing. I'll see #Nyou tomorrow. Good #Nnight.」
【Rikka】_st_0103
【％Ｂ】「Good night.」
％Ｂ
「Seemed like she had something else she wanted to say. Wonder what it was.」
Guess I can just ask her directly tomorrow.
％Ｂ
「All right, I should get to sleep.」
％Ｂ
「Good niiight～」
