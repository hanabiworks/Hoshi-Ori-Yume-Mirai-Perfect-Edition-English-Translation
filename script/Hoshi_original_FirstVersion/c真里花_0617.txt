「This should be everything we need for tools and materials.」
A glass cutter, an L-crank, masking tape, and caulking tools.\n \n\r

All that's left is the actual glass.
Marika
「I got permission to use the old school building's glass～」
Shinozaki handled the negotiations for using the glass.

Natsuki
「I know it was gonna be thrown out anyway, but I'm still surprised you got permission that easily.」
Marika
「I asked them to let us make good use of it, because it'd be a waste to just throw it all away. "It'd be wasteful otherwise" is a universal persuader.」


Rikka
「You can't really say no as an educator if you phrase it that way.」
％Ｂ
「That's some shrewd thinking, Shinozaki.」
all
Marika
「I-I don't think it's that big of a deal～」
all
％Ｂ
「Okay! Then let's get started!」
Natsuki
「What's our first step?」
％Ｂ
「I've drawn out some diagrams, so first we'll need to cut the glass according to these.」

Marika
「What? We're not using it like this?」
％Ｂ
「Nope, it's too big right now.」

Misa
「If we were to make water tanks out of whole sheets of this glass, I believe we would end up with tanks big enough for one ton of water.」

Marika
「Huh? That much? Eeek～」

Natsuki
「But how are we going to cut the glass?」
all
％Ｂ
「It's actually pretty easy to cut glass, if you have the proper tools.」

Misa
「We will be using this glass cutter, yes?」
％Ｂ
「Yes. It'll be easy with that.」
all
Sora
「It's smaller than I expected.」
％Ｂ
「I guess it's more like you put the edge against the glass and break it there, instead of cutting it.」

all
You cut the glass, remove any jagged edges, and temporarily fix them in place with the L-clamp.
And then all you need to do is fill in the gaps between the glass with caulk, and you're done.

It isn't anything difficult on paper.
But there are apparently a few tricks to actually doing it, so I won't know how well it'll turn out until I actually try.

Natsuki
「That seems fun. Let's get to work.」

％Ｂ
「All right, let's get started!」
all
％Ｂ
「Phew... Like this, I guess?」
It took longer than I had expected, but we've managed to finish the caulking stage.\n\r

It may be simple, but it still takes time to do something you're not used to.
But that also means that it'll get easier as I get more used to it.
Touko
「Is it done now?」
％Ｂ
「Pretty much. All that's left is to wait for the caulk to harden, and then we can put some water in to test.」


％Ｂ
「It's apparently best to wait at least a day or so for it to dry completely.」


Rikka
「So that means we're done for today.」
％Ｂ
「That's right.」
all
We should wait until we know it can hold water before we start working on the next one.\n\r

It'd be annoying if we started making more and then found some critical design flaw afterward.
Marika
「I hope it comes out nicely.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. C'mon, you better hold water!」
all
I gently pat my hand on the glass.
