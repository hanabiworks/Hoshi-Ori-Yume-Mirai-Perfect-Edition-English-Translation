And so it's finally time for the Tanabata Festival to begin.
Natsuki
「Okay everyone, attention pleeeease!」
Natsuki
「The astronomy club's "Star Link" Planetarium is now open on the rooftop of the new school building! Our last showing for the morning begins at eleven o'clock! There's still time to come see!」




Natsuki
「The afternoon showings begin at one o'clock! Everyone should come watch! We'll be giving everyone who comes a bonus commemorative photo too! See you all there!」

Marika
「Welcome～ This is the reception for the astronomy club's "Star Link" Planetarium～」



Marika
「The next showing starts at 11. Please wait just a little longer, everyone.」

Shuuichi
「Yo, Shinozaki.」
Marika
「Oh, Nirasawa-kun. Thanks for your hard work today～」
Shuuichi
「What's with this huge line? It keeps going all the way down the stairs from the rooftop. Are all of these people here for the planetarium?」


Marika
「They are. It's been like this ever since the first showing at 9:30.」

Marika
「The chamber of commerce people that the two of them worked part-time for apparently actually put up an advertisement on their website, and they got word around to their customers too.」


Shuuichi
「So that's why there's this many people... Are all these people going to fit in that dome?」
Marika
「I think we're just about reaching the limit. We might have to have whoever comes next wait for the first afternoon showing.」


Shuuichi
「What a roaring success... Okihara-senpai's aquarium's looking crazy too. Yukimura's helping her, but it looks like it might be too much for them, so I asked some event committee people who were free to help them too.」


Marika
「I could see the aquarium being popular with kids～」
Shuuichi
「I might have to get some people here too if it's getting really crowded... By the way, what's he doing?」

Marika
「He's working hard inside, of course～」
Sora
「...Let's look toward the eastern sky next, then.」
Sora
「...One can see a very bright star above the Milky Way. Bright enough that it can be seen clearly even with the naked eye. This is one of the representative stars of summer, Vega in the constellation Lyra.」


I manipulate the controls on the machinery in time with Sora's narration to make Vega gleam even brighter.

Sora
「Vega is famous as Orihime from the legend of Tanabata. You are all aware of the legend of Tanabata, yes?」

Sora
「There is another star which can be found on the other side of the Milky Way. Now then... Whatever could this star be?」

Grade-School Girl A
「It's Hikoboshi!」
Sora
「Yes, that's right. Hikoboshi. Orihime and Hikoboshi are married stars. Now then, let us try to find Hikoboshi next.」

Narusawa plays a comfortable melody on an electric keyboard, the music flowing and swelling in time with Sora's narration.

Everyone looks completely entranced with the relaxing music and the soothing glimmering of the stars all around.


I can see some people from the chamber of commerce too.
Azuma-san's here too, just like he promised.
I wonder if we've been able to repay the favor for all their help this way.

Sora
「We will start at Vega, and move southeast, crossing the Milky Way... And there we find another bright star, shining beautifully in the night sky.」

Sora
「...One just as beautiful as Orihime. This is Orihime's husband, Hikoboshi. Also known as Altair, a first-magnitude star in the constellation Aquila.」

Sora
「Moving even further east from Vega and Altair, we can see a single bird flying southward through the heavens. A beautiful bird, soaring with its wings spread wide... This is the constellation Cygnus.」


Sora
「Near Cygnus's tail, one can spot a large, white star, just as bright as Vega and Altair. This is Deneb.」


Sora
「Vega, Altair, Deneb. By connecting these three stars, we form―」
Grade-School Boy A
「It's a triangle!」
Sora
「Yes, that's right. We can now see a large triangle in the night sky. This is the formation known as the "Summer Triangle."」

The Summer Triangle─
The first thing Sora ever told me about stars...
Sora
『...Can you see that big, bright star there?』
Sora
『...That's Vega. The brightest star in Lyra. It's Tanabata's Princess Orihime.』
Sora
『There's another bright star below Vega.』
Sora
『...That's Altair. The brightest star in Aquila. Tanabata's Hikoboshi.』
Sora
『...And to the left of Vega and Altair is Deneb, in Cygnus.』

Sora
『...Connecting those three stars makes the Summer Triangle.』
She hasn't changed since then. She's always talked about the stars.
And I'm sure that won't change from now on either...
Sora
「A star cannot become a constellation by itself. They tell us many different stories by connecting themselves with other stars as constellations.」


Sora
「And we humans are the same way... We may not be able to do anything by ourselves, but we can give birth to many different stories by connecting with others...」


Sora
「The stars bring encounters... They bring many wonderful encounters and memories.」

Sora
「Meeting all of you here today will become a very wonderful memory for me.」

Sora
「I have a present for all of you who have given me such wonderful memories.」

Those words are my cue to work the machine again.
Countless shooting stars streak across the starry heavens.
I can hear the guests all voice their wonder.
Sora
「This is the Perseid meteor shower, visible in the skies at around this time of year. People have wished upon the stars since ancient times.」

Sora
「Stars can grant wishes. Seeing many shooting stars is sure to grant that many more wishes.」


Sora
「...I wish for all of your wishes to come true.」

The after-festival's happening out on the grounds.
I can hear the voices and music from all the way up on the rooftop.
％Ｂ
「...It's over.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
Sora and I are sitting inside the dome together.
She's sitting cutely between my legs, looking up at the starry sky projected above.

I have my arms around her from behind as I watch the stars.
It's an exclusive planetarium showing for the two of us.
Sora
「...Thank you...」
％Ｂ
「Hm?」
Sora
「...It went well until the very end... thanks to you
, Ryou

.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, yeah... It went great, didn't it?」
People kept coming to watch the planetarium show until the very end of the festival.

There were even some people who said that they wanted the school to put on an event specifically for the planetarium, separate from the Tanabata Festival.

％Ｂ
「Your narration was great. You really improved. I bet the people who came today'll never forget what they learned about the summer night sky.」

Sora
「...Because Ritsu was strict.」
％Ｂ
「Ahahah, she sure was.」
Sora
「...And... I was able to do it without getting nervous because you were nearby... It's thanks to you
, Ryou

.」




％Ｂ
「Oh really... I think I'll claim a reward, then.」
Sora
「...A reward?」
I kiss her as she turns around.
Sora
「Mm... nh...～～～...nh...」
％Ｂ
「Ahh... Thanks. What a great reward.」
Sora
「...Is that all you want for your reward...?」
％Ｂ
「Hm?」
Sora
「Are you sure... you want just a kiss as a reward?」
％Ｂ
「...Uhh...」
A shooting star moves through the projected stars.
It's one of the Perseid shooting stars we programmed to randomly appear.
Sora
「...What kind of wish did you make just now?」
％Ｂ
「...To do it with you.」
Sora
「...That'll come true.」
Another star streaks past as we kiss once more.

We step out from the planetarium dome. The after-festival must be reaching its end. Things are really getting crazy by the stage.


It's supposed to be a karaoke tournament, but now it's become a big sing-along.
％Ｂ
「Haha, this school's so loud.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「...」
％Ｂ
「Hey, Sora. I'm really glad I got to come back to this town.」
Sora
「...And I'm happy I got to see you again
, Ryou

.」
％Ｂ
「There's still a lot of stars we can see in this town, right?」
all
Sora
「Pegasus and Andromeda are pretty in the fall. Those two constellations form the Great Square of Pegasus. It's worthy of the title of the Window of the Heavens.」


Sora
「Orion gallantly runs through the nights in the winter. And Sirius in Canis Major shines proud and bright.」

Sora
「There's Spica in Virgo and Arcturus in Boötes in the spring. The two Married Stars are a symbol of happiness to celebrate and welcome the coming of spring.」

％Ｂ
「And in the summer, we'll see the starry sky we're seeing right now.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「I wanna keep watching the stars together from now on. Summer, fall, winter, spring... Over and over again. I want to watch them together with you, Sora.」


Sora
「...
Ryou
Mm
...」
％Ｂ
「Hm?」
Sora
「...No issues.」
Sora
「We'll always be together... I'll always be with you from now on.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, you're right.」
all
As if to make a wish upon the Milky Way flowing through the night sky above us...
As if to make a vow upon the unchanging light of the stars...
We hold each other tight, and exchange a promise.
