I'm eating lunch in the classroom when Segawa sits down in the seat in front of mine.
Natsuki
「Heya. Sora's not with you today?」
％Ｂ
「...Maybe she's eating lunch with her friends in the courtyard? What are you asking me for anyway?」

Natsuki
「Mmm? I just figured you two would be together.」
％Ｂ
「...I'm only with her for her club activities.」
Natsuki
「Are you? Oh, what are you eating?」
％Ｂ
「This? It's yakisoba bread.」
Natsuki
「Oh, the stuff Sora was eating.」
％Ｂ
「...Were you... watching us?」
Did she see Ousaka and me together back then...?
Natsuki
「That aside, you look like you've been having fun lately. Nirasawa was saying he was worried you might quit the event committee and join the astronomy club.」


％Ｂ
「...I wouldn't go that far. But yeah, it's been fun. I knew a little bit about stars already, but Ousaka's knowledge is off the charts compared to mine.」


％Ｂ
「I just think it's fun to learn new things.」
I acknowledge Segawa's comment without any ill will.
Natsuki
「Mhm, mhm. You're right. But you know... are you sure that's aaall?」

％Ｂ
「Wh-What's that supposed to mean?」
Natsuki
「Mmm? Mmfufu... You're easier to read than I thought, you know. It's all written on your face right this very moment.」

％Ｂ
「Gh...」
Natsuki
「Did you know? Sora's actually pretty popular.」
％Ｂ
「...Is she?」
Natsuki
「You get private requests every now and then when you're in the grad-alb committee. To cut straight to the point, I'm talking about people asking for photos of the person they like.」


Natsuki
「More boys want photos of Sora than you think, you knooow. First years of course, but I get second and third years asking too.」


％Ｂ
「Seriously!?」
Natsuki
「Because she's just cute, isn't she? She's got that bored-looking face, but then she sometimes smiles, once in a blue moon. Makes your heart twinge, you know?」


％Ｂ
「...」
I thought so...
It's something I've thought about before myself.
She's really cute. I bet other guys would try to go for her.
Natsuki
「And she's apparently gotten confessions too. Though I hear she's rejected all of them.」

Sh-She's even gotten confessions...!?
Yeah, that makes sense... The assertive guys would be scrambling for the opportunity...
％Ｂ
「But she's still rejected all of them, huh. I guess she's pretty much obsessed with stars, after all.」

Natsuki
「Mmm, I hear it's something about how she can't forget her first love.」
％Ｂ
「...What...?」
My world lurches around me.
She can't forget... her first love...?
％Ｂ
「H-Huh... Really... Huh, really...」
Natsuki
「Oh? Reeling, are we?」
％Ｂ
「...I'm sorry? You're just seeing what you wanna see...」
Natsuki
「Is that so? You seem kinda down, though.」
％Ｂ
「Y-Yeah, right. No way. I'm totally normal right now.」
Natsuki
「Hmm. Well, that's fine. Either way, I'm cheering you on, at least.」

all
...Segawa leaves cheerily after saying her piece.
Ousaka's... first love...
Could the fact that she's always watching the stars be related to that first love of hers...? Nah, I'm probably overthinking things.

Once classes end, I take the telescope and walk up to the roof together with Ousaka.

I can't help but keep glancing at her as she walks beside me.
Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「...」
Segawa's words from lunch break are whirling around in my head.
...Ousaka's a girl too. She's probably had one or two first loves.

Wait. I guess you can only have one of those...
No, that's not the problem here.
The problem is how Ousaka still can't forget that first love of hers.

％Ｂ
「...」
Who'd have guessed Ousaka would be so earnest about love...
I wonder what he was like.
I really want to know...
Sora
「...I want to know.」
％Ｂ
「Huh?」
Sora
「...I want to know why you keep looking at me like that.」
％Ｂ
「Oh... M-My bad...」
Sora
「...Something wrong?」
％Ｂ
「N-No, nothing wrong.」
Sora
「...You feel a little different from usual.」
％Ｂ
「D-Do I? I'm the same as usual...」
Segawa said I was easy to read too. Do I let my thoughts show that much...?
Sora
「...If you have something you want to say, then just say it.」
％Ｂ
「No, I don't really...」
...I totally do.
％Ｂ
「Uhh... Then can I ask you something?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「Uhhh... Which do you think is more important, the past or the future?」
Sora
「...Is this philosophy?」
％Ｂ
「No... It's not really something you have to think that hard about...」
Sora
「...Which is more important... Past or future...」
She lapses into thought while she walks.
That might've been a weird question...
％Ｂ
「Oh, you don't have to answer. Just ignore it.」

Sora
「...」
She's just going to think I'm weird at this rate...
I shouldn't have ever asked.
We step out onto the roof.
The weather's perfect.
％Ｂ
「Okay. Let's set up the telescope, then.」
Sora
「...」
She stops and looks up at the sky.
％Ｂ
「Ousaka?」
Sora
「...There are stars─」
％Ｂ
「Hm?」
Sora
「...Stars that are light years away from us. The light from a star ten light years away takes ten years to get to us.」

Sora
「If that star disappeared right this very moment, we could keep seeing the light from that star for another ten years.」

She looks up at the yet starless sky as she speaks.
％Ｂ
「Uhh...」
It takes me a few moments to realize that was her answer to my question.

％Ｂ
「So... what's that mean?」
I realized that was her answer, but I don't understand it.
Sora
「...I think the things we leave behind are what's important.」
The things we leave behind... are what's important?
So does that mean... that the past remains precious to Ousaka still?

If that's the case... then Ousaka must still...
Sora
「...The end. That's my answer to your question.」
She takes the telescope from me and starts setting it up just like always.

all
I can't bring myself to press for any more details. I just watch her.

％Ｂ
「Sigh...」
I felt awful the entire time I was with Ousaka today.
I just can't stop thinking about what Segawa told me. Ousaka's "first love."
I realize that I'm taking this really hard.

Which must mean... exactly what I think it means.
I like Ousaka.
％Ｂ
「...」
Of course my time after school's been fun.
Of course it makes me happy to be with the astronomy club.
％Ｂ
「...I wonder... if telling her how I felt would just bother her...」
I'm currently interacting with the astronomy club's Ousaka Sora as the event committee's ％Ａ ％Ｂ, to try to get her to participate in the Tanabata Festival.

That must be what Ousaka thinks.
And if I told Ousaka Sora that I liked her, just as ％Ａ ％Ｂ, then Ousaka would...

％Ｂ
「She... probably wouldn't know what to do...」
The worst-case scenario is her rejecting me.
If I confess and she rejects me, she would probably stop interacting with me, and also completely retract the possibility of participating in the Tanabata Festival.


I would be rejected, and I would say goodbye to Ousaka without having ever done my actual work.

...I can't just up and confess with that in mind.
％Ｂ
「...I'm starting to get less confident the more I think about it.」
No, I'm fine.
She should like me a decent amount at this point!
I'm going to claim that, and I'm going to believe it!
％Ｂ
「The question is whether that's just because she knows she can depend on me as an upperclassman, or if it's that she actually likes me as a guy...」

％Ｂ
「Sigh... It all feels so weird... Maybe I should risk it all and confess...!?」

％Ｂ
「No, but... if she rejects me, I won't be able to show my face at the astronomy club anymore.」
What do I do... What should I do?
％Ｂ
「Sigh... Ughh... What the hell...」
I roll around on my bed in anguish.
And that's how I spent that early summer night.
