I wake up to the sound of the doorbell ringing.
％Ｂ
「Fuaaahh... Who the heck comes here this early in the morning～?」
％Ｂ
「Hm? Morning...?」
I look at the clock.
It's past nine o'clock.
％Ｂ
「Ack!? I'm totally late!! Crap...!」

％Ｂ
「Ggyaaaaaaaahhhh!?」
Pain stabs through my entire body as soon as I leap out of bed.
％Ｂ
「Gh, agh, ow!? Hgh, ghhhh...!?」
Marika
「I-I heard a really loud scream! Are you okay!?」
％Ｂ
「Shi...Shinozaki...? Oh, so you were the one ringing the doorbell...」

％Ｂ
「No, the time! We're late!」
Marika
「Huh? Late? ...Today's Sunday, though...」
％Ｂ
「Wha...? Sunday? O-Ohh... Right...」

Now that I think about it, she's right.
I got all freaked out for nothing.
all
％Ｂ
「And my leg hurts...」
I crouch down and cradle my aching leg.
It's covered with a hard cast from the shin down.
Marika
「I think you need to stay still～ Your bone's cracked.」

all
I couldn't even get up after what happened yesterday, much less walk. I was carried away by ambulance.

After I got to the hospital, I was diagnosed with a bone fracture.
I apparently cracked my bone, so this is how I ended up.
％Ｂ
「Sucks that I cracked it just from tripping...」
Marika
「Um, I'm sorry. It seems like I made you worry, and...」

％Ｂ
「It's not your fault, Shinozaki. You were saving that girl.」

It's 100 percent my fault for getting freaked out like an idiot and tripping like a moron.\n\r

You reap what you sow.
Marika
「But still... that cast looks really inconvenient.」
％Ｂ
「It really is.」
Walking's a pain, of course, but nothing's really the same in general.
I can't do anything to a satisfying degree, even stuff that I didn't even have to put thought into doing before.

Marika
「So here, have this. I thought you might have trouble making food too.」

She holds out a paper bag.
There's some delicious-looking sandwiches inside.
％Ｂ
「You made this for me?」
Marika
「Yeah, I figured you'd need some help, so... I thought I could make food for you today. If it isn't a bother, of course...」


％Ｂ
「No, you didn't have to do that. I bet it was a ton of work.」
Marika
「But it's my fault.」
％Ｂ
「I told you, you don't need to worry about it.」
Marika
「I don't think so～ ...Because you were rushing so much for me.」

％Ｂ
「Well... I was, but that was just me getting worried all on my own...」
Marika
「But you got so worried about me that you fractured your bone, right?」

％Ｂ
「Well yeah, I did...」
Marika
「So then it's my fault after all. That's why I need to take responsibility and take care of you... I think so, at least～」


％Ｂ
「...Is it just me, or are you really excited somehow?」
Marika
「Huh!? Th-That's not true! There's no way I'd be...」

Marika
「I'm not a demon like that...」
％Ｂ
「I didn't say it made you a demon...」
％Ｂ
「Then could I have you help me out, as much as you can without causing you any trouble?」

Marika
「Yeah! Leave it to me!」
She definitely seems weirdly motivated... right?
all
％Ｂ
「I'll dig into this right away.」
I may be hurt, but I still get hungry.
I've decided to eat the sandwiches Shinozaki brought me right away.
Marika
「Please do♪ This one's ham and cheese, this one's egg, this one's teriyaki chicken, and this is a fruit sandwich.」


％Ｂ
「This fruit sandwich looks amazing...」
The others look good too, but the fruit-filled one looks particularly impressive.

％Ｂ
「It may be sandwich heresy, but I think I'll go for this one first.」
Marika
「I'd like it if you just ate whatever you wanted. It has strawberries, kiwi, and oranges～」

％Ｂ
「Then let's have a bite... Oooohhh!?」
Just the right amount of sweet and sour flavor flows into my mouth.

％Ｂ
「This is great!」
Marika
「Really? You sure the cream isn't too sweet?」
％Ｂ
「No, it's perfect. This is seriously delicious.」
I'm pretty sure I haven't eaten a fruit sandwich since I was a kid. Were these always this delicious?\n\r

It's so good I finish the rest of it in a single bite.
Marika
「Ahahaha, that's way too quick～ Look, you have cream around your mouth.」

She reaches out and scoops the cream away from around my mouth.

％Ｂ
「O-Oh yeah, thanks...」
Marika
「You're like a kid. Hehe...」
She smiles and casually licks the cream off of her finger.
％Ｂ
「Uh... That was around my mouth...」
Marika
「Oh... Y-You're right, it was... Oh no, that was shameless of me...」

Is that what you'd call shameless? ...That was an indirect kiss, wasn't it?
I know it's not something I should worry about, but...
％Ｂ
「I-I'll have the teriyaki chicken next, then.」
all
It's kinda awkward to not say anything, so I'm just gonna eat.
I bite into the thick chicken sandwich.
Marika
「Be careful not to get the sauce around your mouth this time, okay?」
％Ｂ
「...My bad. It's already too late.」
I already have a ton of sauce around my lips because of how I bit into the sandwich.

Marika
「Geez, you're such a kid. Here, turn this way.」

％Ｂ
「Huh? You gonna lick this too?」
Marika
「N-No, I'm not～ I'm just going to wipe it with some tissues～」
％Ｂ
「Oh, okay. You should've just done that the last time.」
Marika
「I really should've, right? Ahaha...」
She laughs stiffly as she wipes my mouth with a napkin.
％Ｂ
「Sorry that you have to do everything.」
Marika
「You have it rough because you're hurt, so I'd like it if you relied on me.」
％Ｂ
「Thanks. Seriously.」
I decide to let her spoil me for now.
Marika
「Is there... anything other than food that's hard for you to do alone?」
％Ｂ
「Other than food...」
Something comes to mind right away.
But that's a bit hard to say...
Marika
「What is it? If it's anything I can do, I'd be happy if you told me.」
％Ｂ
「Well, but... Uhh～ ...Well...」
％Ｂ
「Uh, it's... baths.」
Marika
「Huh? Baths?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. Baths.」
％Ｂ
「We went to the ocean yesterday, right? So I wanted to take a bath afterward, but I really didn't think I could with this cast...」


％Ｂ
「Which means I stink right now, so don't come too close, okay?」
Marika
「I-I don't mind that, you know～」
Marika
「But... Okay. A bath, huh...」
Shinozaki seems lost on what to do.
Which isn't surprising.
％Ｂ
「Don't worry. I'm sure I'll get used to it eventually. I'll put a plastic bag around the cast or something. I'll look something up on the internet.」


Marika
「But still, that's a problem... Okay! I'll help!」

％Ｂ
「What? Help me? ...Seriously?」
Marika
「It's not like you could ask someone else to do something like that...」
％Ｂ
「Well yeah, but...」
But it'd be weird to ask Shinozaki to do it then, right?
It's not like Shinozaki's family, or... my girlfriend or something.

Marika
「I think it'd be okay if you wore your swimsuit～ We've already taken a bath together anyway, so I don't mind.」


％Ｂ
「Oh... Right, we did, didn't we...」
We've done that twice at this point.
Once wearing swimsuits, but we were both completely naked the other time...
Marika
「I have work after this, so I just happen to have my swimsuit with me. It's perfect timing, so let's take a bath right now.」

％Ｂ
「Hmm, well... I guess if that's the case...」

Shinozaki lends me her shoulder and helps me down to the living room.
％Ｂ
「Thanks. Man, casts are so inconvenient.」

Marika
「It'll be hard to change into your swimsuit too, right? U-Um... Should I help you?」

％Ｂ
「What? No, that'd be bad, right?」
I'd have to get naked to change into my swimsuit.
Marika
「But it'd be terrible if you lost your balance and fell. I... want to at least help you take your pants off.」

％Ｂ
「Well, if that's the case...」
Then it's fine, right?
It actually took me over ten minutes to change into my pajamas last night.
The cast itself got in the way, and having my ankle in a fixed position was even more inconvenient than expected.

Marika
「Just your pants then.」
％Ｂ
「Sorry... and thanks.」
Marika
「Then...」
She places a hand on my pajama pants.
Marika
「...」
％Ｂ
「...」
Someone's taking my pants off for me.
I don't remember this ever happening before.
Well, I guess it might've happened when I was a kid.
But having a girl my age do it...
Marika
「...Hahhhh～」
It feels ridiculously weird.
I can't stop being overly conscious of what's happening.
I'm going to have a girl my age take my pants off for me, and end up just in my underwear in front of her...

％Ｂ
「...」
Marika
「...」
I can tell Shinozaki's doing her best not to look, but it's also painfully obvious she's conscious of what's happening too.

It's not like she's looking, but I've got this weird feeling at my crotch. I almost get it up without meaning to.\n\r

If I get hard now, that'd be the end of us.
I desperately hold myself back, trying to prevent it from happening at all costs.
Marika
「Please lift your leg a bit～」
％Ｂ
「L-Like this?」
Marika
「Thanks... I'll take these off.」
She pulls off the pajama pants that she's lowered down to my ankles.
I'm seriously wearing nothing but underwear on my lower body now. It's incredibly embarrassing.

Marika
「I-Is this okay? How about your...」
％Ｂ
「I-I'm fine! Thanks. I can do the rest myself...」

Marika
「Okay... I'll be using the changing room, then. I'll be going in first, so you can come in once you're ready.」

all
Shinozaki leaves the living room.
％Ｂ
「Phew...」
...That was nerve-racking.
％Ｂ
「I'll have to hold it in while we're in the bath too...」
％Ｂ
「Hup... Thanks, that really helps.」
Marika
「Wow... It's so much work just sitting in a low seat.」
％Ｂ
「Thank god this bath's got some handrails.」
Marika
「It's the kind of thing you only notice once something like this happens.」

％Ｂ
「These were a good idea, for when my parents get older too.」
Marika
「I feel like you're thinking a little too far ahead～ Oh... Is your foot okay?」

I have a plastic bag tied off over the cast on my foot to protect it from the water.\n\r

I think it'll be enough to survive at least a shower.
Marika
「I'll wash your back, then... Huh? Do you not have a sponge or anything?」

％Ｂ
「Oh yeah, I forgot to buy one, now that you mention it. It's still just me living here, so I just use my hands like this...」

Welcome to the life of a guy living alone.
％Ｂ
「Uhh, I'm pretty sure there's some small towels in the changing room...」
Marika
「But I'm already wet... Mmm... If you usually use your hands, then I guess the same is fine?」

all
％Ｂ
「Huh? Well, that's...」
Shinozaki grabs some soap and starts rubbing it onto my back.
％Ｂ
「O-Okay...」
Marika
「What do you think?」
％Ｂ
「It-It feels nice...」
Her hands are surprisingly small.
And just plain soft.
Marika
「Really? I'm so glad～ I'll just wash your back like this, then!」

She slowly applies force and rubs her palm against my back.
It feels good... but it feels a little too good.

Marika
「Ehehe, this is kinda fun～♪」
％Ｂ
「I-Is it?」
I don't have the time to enjoy this. I'm desperate here. I have to make sure my crotch doesn't react...

Marika
「Oh, quiz time♪」
％Ｂ
「Quiz time?」
I have no idea what she's talking about. But then I feel something weird on my back.
％Ｂ
「...A word?」
Marika
「What did I write～?」
She's apparently writing a word onto my back with her finger.
％Ｂ
「I can't tell. Hmm...」
I focus on my back as she writes something over and over.
％Ｂ
「It's, uh... M... a... r... i... k... a? ...Wait, it's your name.」

Marika
「Ahaha, correct～ Next one, then!」

She starts moving her finger across my back again.
％Ｂ
「D... o... e... s... y... o... u... r... l... e... g... "Does your leg hurt?" Nah, it's fine.」


Marika
「If it starts hurting, I'd like it if you told me right away. Then the next one is...」

Marika
「Oh... The bubbles are going away. I need more body soap...」

The body soap's right in front of me.
％Ｂ
「I'll grab it.」
I reach out for it, but I can't push myself forward because of the cast. I can't reach.

Marika
「Oh, don't worry. I'll get it.」
Shinozaki pushes herself onto my back and reaches out toward the soap.

all
Squish♪
％Ｂ
「...!?」
An out-of-this-world softness presses against my back.

Is this...?
Marika
「Oh! ...I-I'm sorry!」
She realizes too, and jumps away.
So that really was... Shinozaki's chest.
％Ｂ
「N-No, I should be apologizing...!」
Marika
「A-Ahaha... I shouldn't have been lazy... I should've just stood up and gotten it!」
％Ｂ
「Y-Yeah.」
Marika
「Eheheh, right～」
all
It was just for a moment, but it felt incredibly soft.
I don't think I've ever touched anything that soft before.
I didn't know that a girl's chest... or more like, I didn't know Shinozaki's chest was that soft.

Marika
「Got iiit! It's easy enough to just get up and grab it, so I really shouldn't be lazy, right? ...Oh.」


Her smile freezes.
She flushes crimson instantly.
And then she starts writing on my back again.
Looks like a sudden continuation of the quiz.
％Ｂ
「Let's see... I... t... s... b... i... g... g...」
％Ｂ
「...Uh.」
"It's bigger."
That's what she seems to be writing on my back.
Or more like there's nothing else it could possibly be.
That's when I realize how my crotch feels.
％Ｂ
「Uh...」
My swimsuit's puffed up at the crotch.
...I've clearly got a boner right now.
％Ｂ
「M-My bad! I'm sorry...!」
Marika
「N-No...」
％Ｂ
「B-But it's not what it looks like! It's not because I'm feeling weird or anything...」

Marika
「Huh? Really～? Does that happen to boys... even if it isn't something like that?」

％Ｂ
「Uhh, it's like... something unconscious...」
Marika
「But it's because, um... because I rubbed my boobs against you, right?」
％Ｂ
「Well...」
Marika
「Th-Then it's my responsibility too... and I hear boys can't do anything about that... S-So it'd make me happy if you didn't worry so much～」


％Ｂ
「O-Okay... Then let's just say it was something like that.」
Marika
「O-Okay...」
She says not to worry about it, but that's impossible.
It's crazy awkward.
It's way too awkward.
Marika
「Um... Maybe I should wash the front, too? Oh! ...I don't mean in a dirty way, okay!?」

％Ｂ
「I-I know that! The front's fine. I can do that myself.」

Marika
「R-Really...? Oh, th-then... I'll close my eyes.」

％Ｂ
「S-Sorry about that.」
My crotch isn't showing the slightest sign of calming down. In fact, it's gotten even harder.\n\r

I had no idea my crotch was so despicable.
Marika
「...Hauh...」
Those breaths she lets out occasionally seem kinda erotic to me.
all
Clear my mind. I need to clear my mind...
$$smh_OpenCHK
％Ｂ
「Ughh～ ...I'm kinda dizzy.」
It's all because of my shameful behavior.
％Ｂ
「Uh... Shouldn't think about it...」
I frantically shake my head to clear my thoughts. I almost got turned on again remembering that soft sensation.

％Ｂ
「Ughhh... So dizzy...」
Marika
「A-Are you okay～?」
％Ｂ
「Oh, Shinozaki... D-Don't worry, I'm fine.」
Marika
「We ended up taking a lot of time. It's all because I'm so slow.」

％Ｂ
「Not at all. It's not your fault... Hm? More importantly, something smells good.」

This is... the smell of curry.
Marika
「Oh, right. I made lunch, so it'd make me happy if you ate it.」

％Ｂ
「What? You even made me lunch?」
Marika
「It's just curry, though. It might be better to let it simmer a little longer, though. I didn't have too much time, since I have to go to work.」


％Ｂ
「Man, I'm so sorry for making you do all this.」
Marika
「No, this is about all I can do anyway.」
％Ｂ
「And you're not complaining one bit... Seriously. Thank you.」

Marika
「U-Um～ ...To be honest... I'm a little happy.」
％Ｂ
「Happy?」
Marika
「Y-Yeah. I'm a bad person for being happy when you're hurt...」
Marika
「But I'm a little happy that I'm of use to you
, Hino-kun

.」

Marika
「I never thought I could do anything like that. I thought I'd always be dragging you down.」

％Ｂ
「What are you saying? Thinking about it, you've only been helping me out this whole time.」

Marika
「That's not true...」
Her cheeks flush.
But she looks satisfied.
％Ｂ
「I was so surprised yesterday, too. I ran over 'cause I thought you fell in the ocean, and then I saw you with that girl in your arms.」


I recall the moment.
Shinozaki was holding the girl tightly.
She was done crying...
It was like she was being enveloped in Shinozaki's comfort and kindness.
And when I saw that... I sighed deeply in relief.
$$smh_OpenCHK
％Ｂ
「You used to be so frail back when we were kids.」
Marika
「I'm fine now. My asthma's all better now.」

She states it with a proud smile.
Marika
「And I'm helping out with the swim class at work now too.」

Marika
「I've learned what to do in the worst-case scenario, and I remember all of it. I knew that I needed to keep an eye on the kids since we were near the sea.」


％Ｂ
「Really... That's impressive. You said you started working at the pool 'cause you learned how to swim there, right?」


Marika
「Yeah. The teacher asked me. They said they didn't have enough people helping on weekends, and it looked fun, because most of the customers are kids.」


％Ｂ
「I've heard about this already, I guess it's really true.」
Marika
「I started when I was twelve. Because I heard swimming was good for people with asthma.」

％Ｂ
「Huh, swimming's good for people with asthma?」
Marika
「It's more like doing exercise makes it harder for it to trigger. It's apparently best to do full-body cardiac exercise.」

Marika
「And once you start noticing the results of the exercise, you get more confident, and that gets you more positive about things in general.」

％Ｂ
「I get it.」
Now that she mentions it, she really is positive now.
I almost can't believe this is the same girl who was always just lying in bed all day.

％Ｂ
「You've really done your best.」
Marika
「Yeah... I think I have. I couldn't even put my face in the water at first, but now I can swim as far as I want, at my own pace.」


Marika
「I remember I tried doing dry-towel rub-downs too～ And I sang in chorus back in middle school, too. Apparently breathing from the diaphragm is good for asthma.」


％Ｂ
「Really. You did that much?」
Marika
「Asthma's pretty dependent on constitution, so it's not guaranteed that it'll never happen again... but even if it does, I'll definitely bring it under control.」


She looks right at me.
I can see the determination in her eyes.
These eyes might be what's changed the most about her.
$$smh_OpenCHK
％Ｂ
「Shinozaki... You've really gotten stronger.」
Marika
「I don't know about that. But if I have... that's all thanks to you too


, Hino-kun

.」
％Ｂ
「Huh? Me?」
Marika
「The reason I started wanting to get better was because I met you
, Hino-kun

.」
Marika
「I was really, really sad back then that I couldn't have any good memories with you.」

Marika
「The chorus concert, the goodbye stargazing... I couldn't go to any of that because of my asthma. I couldn't make any memories...」


Marika
「I couldn't sleep at all on the night of that stargazing party. I was so mad, so frustrated, and so sad. It hurt so much.」

Marika
「I was staring up at the bamboo leaves and the night sky... and that's when I realized.」

Marika
「That I wouldn't be able to be by your side if all I did was write wishes on tanzaku, and wish on the stars.」



Marika
「I wanted to be by your side
, Hino-kun

. I wanted to make lots of memories with you.」

Marika
「That's why I decided to get better. That's why... being with you like this is like a dream to me.」

％Ｂ
「Shinozaki...」
It's like I can feel her determination and emotions flow into me. My heart shivers.

And now I'm ashamed of myself for just blindly worrying about her all this time, without knowing about all of her efforts.


Marika
「Oh, I know. Hey, are there any tanzaku left?」
％Ｂ
「...Tanzaku? I'm pretty sure there's some leftovers from the event committee around here...」

Marika
「Oh, I found one. I'm going to use one of these.」
all
She's writing something on the tanzaku.
Marika
「Done. I'll hang this up.」
"I wish for Hino-kun's foot to get better soon."
"I wish for ％Ａ-kun's foot to get better soon."
Is what's written there.
Marika
「I hope you get better soon.」
She smiles.
My heart throbs.
Mother
「What～? You're actually wearing a cast!?」
My mom showed up at around sunset, and that was the first thing she said.
I told her about my leg as soon as I knew it was a fracture, and she apparently got worried and came here.

Mother
「This is why I told you to be careful. What on earth were you doing to break a bone?」

％Ｂ
「It's just a little cracked. I told you, I tripped and fell on some rocks.」

Mother
「You've never done anything like that before. It looks like you living by yourself is dangerous after all...」

％Ｂ
「Me living alone has nothing to do with falling on rocks! Anyway, it's no big deal, so you don't need to worry.」

Mother
「You say that, but you can't do anything with your leg like that, can you? Like make food...」


Mother
「Oh, there's curry. Who made this?」

％Ｂ
「Shinozaki made it for me.」
Mother
「Oh, Marika-chan came? Wow～ Looks like you two are getting along nicely, even after it's been so long.」


％Ｂ
「Stop with the weirdly appreciative tone. It's nothing weird, is it? She's a childhood friend, and we live near each other again.」


％Ｂ
「Besides, you were the one who was nagging me about going to her place right away to say hi.」

Mother
「And? Is Marika-chan still as cute as ever?」
％Ｂ
「Excuse me? What does that have to do with anything?」
Mother
「I should've come a little earlier～ Then I would've gotten to see Marika-chan.」

％Ｂ
「It's not like you've ever gotten to talk to Shinozaki much before, right?」

Mother
「Oh, I've said hi more than a few times. She was a small, adorable girl. She was definitely going to be really pretty when she grew up～」


Mother
「Hmm. The two of you eating curry... I see.」
％Ｂ
「Don't jump to weird conclusions.」
Mother
「I think I'll have some curry and go home, then.」
％Ｂ
「Ugh... What'd you even come here for?」
Mother
「It looks like there wasn't anything for me to worry about. And it looks like I'm in the way here, too.」

％Ｂ
「I told you not to jump to weird conclusions.」
You're just making me weirdly conscious of it...
My mom then proceeds to eat curry and just leave.

Marika
「Whaaat? Your mom was here? She went home already?」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, she did. She's so all over the place.」
Shinozaki dropped by again on her way back from work.
Marika
「I completely missed her. I wanted to at least say hi～」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, my mom told me to let you know she said hi. And do you even remember my mom?」

Marika
「Of course I do～ She came by my house a few times to say hello. She brought pudding. It was so good～」


％Ｂ
「Yeah, you never forget a debt of pudding.」
Marika
「It-It's not like that～」
It was a joke, but Shinozaki turns bright red.
Marika
「She talked lots with me. Like, "My son isn't bothering you, is he?"」

％Ｂ
「Huh, I never knew.」
I guess they were talking without me ever knowing.
Marika
「She told me stories about when you were small, too. Like how you took apart a brand-new TV back in preschool.」





％Ｂ
「Huh? ...Oh yeah, I remember something like that.」
Now that she mentions it, I do recall doing that.
％Ｂ
「I got really curious about what was inside the TV when I was watching it. So I decided to take it apart... That's probably what I was thinking.」

Marika
「That's amazing～ You must have had what it takes since all the way back then.」

％Ｂ
「What it takes for what?」
Marika
「Being an architect.」
％Ｂ
「Y-You think so? No, I'm not really...」

Her saying I "have what it takes to be an architect" makes me blush.
It might be especially bad... because Shinozaki's the one saying it.
Why is it especially embarrassing when she says it?
I suddenly remember the two of us taking a bath together earlier today.
The warmth of her hands...
And how her breasts felt pressed against my back.
Marika
「I heard looots of other stories too. I was so happy～」

％Ｂ
「That much? Not like they were good stories anyway, right?」
Marika
「Well, who knows～?」
She smiles happily.
Her laughing tickles at me.
I can't help but feel like us being alone together like this is special.
It's happened so many times before, but why is it suddenly so...?
％Ｂ
「It must be my mom's fault...」
It's because she said some weird stuff earlier.
Marika
「What's your mom's fault?」
％Ｂ
「Oh, uh... Nothing.」
Marika
「Really? But make sure you tell me the next time she comes, okay? I need to make sure to introduce myself.」

％Ｂ
「Introduce yourself...」
Marika
「A-Ahahaha... Saying it like that makes it sound like I'm your girlfriend...」

％Ｂ
「Wh-What are you saying...?」
There's seriously something wrong with me...
