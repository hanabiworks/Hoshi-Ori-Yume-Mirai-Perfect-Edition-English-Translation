Touko
「Oh, good mor...ning...?」
％Ｂ
「Sorry, it's gonna take a little longer for me to make lunch! Come wait inside!」

Touko
「O-Okay...! Um... What's with the...?」
％Ｂ
「Hm? Oh, the apron? I'm wearing it 'cause I don't wanna get my uniform dirty.」

Touko
「R-Right...! Uniform... and apron...!」
％Ｂ
「More importantly, your face is kinda red... You okay? You're not feeling sick, are you...?」

Touko
「I-I'm fine! It's nothing!」
...Wonder what's going on. She seems weirdly flustered.
％Ｂ
「...You sure? Well, as long as you're not sick or anything.」
Touko
「You're making lunch, right!? I'll wait! I'll come in!」

％Ｂ
「Yeah... Sorry to make you wait when you came here to pick me up.」
all
％Ｂ
「All right, sorry for the wait. Let's get going, then.」
Touko
「...Mhm, yeah.」
％Ｂ
「...Why are you so down suddenly?」
Touko
「No reeeason. It's nothiiing.」
Her "It's nothing" sounds way more depressed than the one she gave earlier.
...Did I do something?
Touko
「Aw maaan... I should've taken a photo... I need to make sure I don't forget next time.」

％Ｂ
「A photo? You see a cat or something?」
Touko
「Something like that, I guess. I'm hoping to get a really nice photo.」
％Ｂ
「Show me it if you end up getting that photo. If it's cute, send it to me too.」

Touko
「Ahaha, okay! Look forward to it!」
％Ｂ
「Anyway... Isn't it a lot of work for you to come all the way here to pick me up?」
Touko
「No, it's not. Because I have more to look forward to in the morning this way than I would if I just went to school.」

％Ｂ
「...I see.」
Touko
「And I got another thing to look forward to today. I think it might be my special privilege.」

％Ｂ
「You mean the lunchbox? I'm pretty proud of how it came out. Hope you're looking forward to lunch.」

Touko
「...You're a bit off, but oh well.」
％Ｂ
「Hm? A little off? ...What's off?」
Touko
「Don't worry about it. Come on, we'll be late if we don't hurry.」
％Ｂ
「Crap, let's get going! I don't wanna have to run in this heat!」
【Touko】_st_0305
【Touko】「Hurry and cooome. I'm #Nhungryyy.」
【％Ｂ】「Sure, coming now.」
【Touko】「I'll leave the door #Nunlocked, okay?」
【Touko】_st_0301
％Ｂ
「All right. Let's get going.」
Touko's probably gonna be in a bad mood if I don't hurry.
I head to the old school building, lunchbox in hand.
Touko
「Wow, amazing! This looks sooo good!」
It's finally time for lunch.
Touko's overjoyed after opening the lunchbox.
Touko
「I can eat this, right!? I love fried egg!」
％Ｂ
「Of course you can. I made this for you, so you can eat as much as you want.」

Touko
「All riiight! Let's eat!」
She happily begins eating.
Seeing her this happy makes it all worth it.
％Ｂ
「How's it taste?」
Touko
「Mh... Mhm! It's so good!」
％Ｂ
「Here, I brought some tea, too. Eat slowly, all right?」
Touko
「Okaaay. Wooow. I wanna eat lunch like this every day!」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, I spent last night getting everything ready to cook. I'm glad it came out good today too.」

Touko
「Mm? Today "too"?」
Touko
「This is the first time I've had a lunchbox made by you
, Ryousuke-kun

.」
％Ｂ
「I actually made a lunchbox for Shinozaki and Segawa before. They liked it too.」

Touko
「...Oh really.」
Oh. She's suddenly in a bad mood.
I don't think I said anything weird...
Touko
「So what you're saying is that there's a girl who's eaten your cooking before me. Two of them, even.」




％Ｂ
「Uh, Touko...?」
Touko
「I bet that lunchbox must've tasted reeeally gooood. It was different from today's too, right?」

％Ｂ
「Y-Yeah. It was... fried chicken, fried eggs, and sautéed sausage, I think? And I made some rice balls to have with that too...」


Touko
「Really nooow... I bet those rice balls had lots of love packed in... You shape them directly with your hands, after all...」

％Ｂ
「It didn't mean anything special, just so you know! That was just 'cause I wanted to thank them for giving me advice...!」

Touko
「Advice? Advice for what?」
％Ｂ
「...For how I should confess to you.」
Touko
「Wha? Y-You asked them for advice about that!?」
％Ｂ
「'Cause it was my first time confessing to someone, and you weren't letting me try back then! So I thought I needed some help!」


Touko
「...Really. Now that I think about it, I remember Camera-chan saying something like that the other day. I guess I should be grateful to her and Flower-chan.」


％Ｂ
「No need to worry about that. They ate a ton of that lunchbox.」
Especially Segawa. Never would've expected her to start eating my share too.
Though that was fine by me, since it meant she liked it just that much.
Touko
「I wanna eat rice balls too tomorrow. Can I?」
％Ｂ
「Sure. What do you want in them?」
Touko
「Salmon! I like kelp too, but the go-to for rice balls is salmon!」

％Ｂ
「Salmon and kelp it is, then. I'll make some pickled plum ones too, 'cause they're a classic.」

Touko
「All riiight! I'm so, so excited for lunch tomorrow too!」
all
Touko
「I'm done. That was sooo good!」
％Ｂ
「I'm glad you liked it. Seeing you eat everything makes me happy.」
Touko
「Mmm... I'm starting to get a little sleepy now that I'm full...」
％Ｂ
「Wha? Wait, Touko!?」
Touko
「Mmm... It's the perfect size. It's a bit hot, but it feels nice...」

％Ｂ
「Come on, you're gonna fall asleep if you relax that much.」
Touko
「Mmm... Yeah, but... I'm sleepy... Hey, let's sleep togetheeer...」

％Ｂ
「Excuse me!?」
I can feel her softness.
A nice smell tickles my nostrils. I'm only getting more nervous, in stark contrast to how relaxed Touko is.

Touko
「...I can hear your heartbeat. It's beating really fast, you know.」
％Ｂ
「I-I can't help it, can I...!? Of course I'm nervous when you're this close!」

Touko
「Ehehe, me too. Sitting here makes my heart beat fast, but it's also calming.」

％Ｂ
「...Never would've guessed from how you look.」
Touko
「Oh, your heartbeats got a little faster. What are you thinking abooout?」

％Ｂ
「N-Nothing! How long are you planning on doing this for anyway!?」

Touko
「Until I'm satisfiiied. Mmm... I wonder if there's anywhere I fit a little better.」

％Ｂ
「Hey, don't move! That's dangerous!」
I hope she doesn't ask me to elaborate on what's dangerous specifically.
I'm gonna react in a certain way if she moves her butt around on my crotch like that, of course.
Touko
「Oh, this spot's niiice. Okay then, good niiight...」
She starts snoozing after apparently finding a nice spot.
I'm happy that she's cuddling against me like this. I feel fulfilled.

％Ｂ
「Man... Guess I'll be stuck this way for a while.」
Hm. Wait a second...
I can hear a bell... What time is it right now?
％Ｂ
「Hgh!? Crap! Touko, wake up!」
Touko
「Nh, nnnh... Whaaat...?」
％Ｂ
「Lunch break's over in three minutes! We need to get back to class!」
Touko
「Mmm... I think it's fine. We can skip class for a biiit...」

Uh, no, we can't.\n \n \n\r
Worst-case scenario, if one of the teachers comes here looking for us... We're gonna get in a whole lot of trouble. It probably wouldn't end with us just being prohibited from entering the old school building.

Touko doesn't seem to have any intention of waking up.
I'd probably sour her mood if I forced her to wake up. Should I still do it...?

Hurry back to class.
Just stay here.
It's not a good idea to skip class.
And we've already skipped afternoon classes together once already.
They might really try looking for us this time. We should go back to class, even if we do end up being a bit late.

％Ｂ
「No! Come on, wake up! We can still make it in time if we go back now!」

Touko
「Nooo～! I'm sleepyyy～!」
％Ｂ
「Sleep in class! We're going back!」
Touko
「I wanna sleep on your lap, Ryousukeee～ It feels soooo nice～」

Touko
「I wanna sleep on your laaap～ It feels soooo nice～」

I force Touko to wake up against her will.
I could've probably gotten her to wake up right away by saying she was heavy or something... but I bet she would've been real angry.

I hurried back and ended up about two minutes late.
I got off with a bit of a lecture. Segawa was grinning at me.
And Narusawa looked at me as if she were witnessing something scandalous...
I should be careful from now on to not sleep through lunch break.
This isn't going to work. Touko doesn't seem like she wants to wake up at all.
And it'd be dangerous to move her by force when she's leaning on me like this...

Touko
「Ehehe... Good night agaaain... Let's sleep togetheeer... Zzz...」

She swiftly begins snoozing again.
Now I really can't move.
％Ｂ
「...Man. We've really become a couple of delinquent transfer students, haven't we?」
I feel guilty about skipping class... but Touko's being so cute for me, without reservations.\n\r

It fills me with a happy, ticklish sense of fulfillment.
％Ｂ
「Agh, class started.」
The bell rings.
I wouldn't wanna walk into class when it's already in session. I guess I'll just relax here for now.

Natsuki
「Oh, you're back! Where were you!?」
％Ｂ
「A-Ahaha... Long story.」
Natsuki
「I bet you were just cuddling with Touko and stuff. Ugh, how scandalous.」

％Ｂ
「That's... not wrong, but we didn't do anything dirty, all right!?」
Natsuki
「I covered for you on skipping. You better be grateful.」

％Ｂ
「Seriously!? Thanks, Segawa! You're a lifesaver!」
Natsuki
「I told the teacher, "
Hino's 
He's 
currently in the infirmary because of his period cramps."」
％Ｂ
「What the hell kinda ridiculously obvious lie is that!? It would've been better if you didn't say anything at aaall!」

Natsuki
「What the heck! I gave you the perfect, hilarious cover story! You have no right to complain!」


Rikka
「D-Don't worry. Um, no one really believes you're on your p-pe...od
, Hino-kun

.」

％Ｂ
「...Thanks, Narusawa.」
...I'd be kinda scared if anyone actually believed it.
all
Touko
「You're going to Jellyfish-senpai now, right? Can I come with?」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, I am... What are you asking for permission for?」
Touko
「Mmm... I thought I might be in the way if I were there, you know?」
％Ｂ
「You wouldn't be. I like being together with you while I'm doing committee work too.」

Touko
「...I'll come with, then.」
She intertwines her fingers with mine.
I can feel happiness radiating out from my fingertips as our pinkies tangle together.

Natsuki
「Oh, doing event committee work together? Where to?」
all
I feel Touko's fingertips slip away from mine at the same time as I hear Segawa's voice.
That's a bit of a shame.
％Ｂ
「The second chemistry classroom. I'm gonna go check up on Okihara-senpai's naturalist club.」

Natsuki
「Misa-san? Huh, that sounds interesting! Mind if I come along too!?」

％Ｂ
「Sure, I don't think that'll be a problem. I doubt she'll mind that you're there.」

Natsuki
「Lucky me! Sounds like a good photo opportunity! I've been trying to find a subject for today!」

％Ｂ
「You don't have to force yourself to take photos every day, do you? You don't need that many photos for the graduation album, right?」

Natsuki
「You just don't get it. This is like a diary to me.」

％Ｂ
「Ah, like a picture diary?」
Natsuki
「That's right. Looking at photos lets me remember exactly how I felt at the time, you know? I treasure every single day of our lives at school.」


I wanna follow Segawa's example for stuff like this.
I'll need to do my best to make sure school's fun for everyone too, as a member of the event committee.
Natsuki
「Let's get going, then! I'll take lots of good photos!」

％Ｂ
「Hellooo. Okihara-senpai, are you here?」
Misa
「Oh my, what are we all here for today?」
％Ｂ
「We're here to check on the naturalist club's progress for the Tanabata Festival. How are things going?」

Misa
「I am currently working on it... but it appears I cannot make as much headway as I would like while working alone.」

Touko
「Why don't you have someone help?」
Misa
「Everyone else already appears to be quite busy. I believe that I may be able to make it in time... if I plan to do a little less than my original ideas.」

She's smiling, but she seems disappointed.
I wish I could help her... but I've already volunteered to be in charge of the old school building. It's hard to imagine that I'd be free.

％Ｂ
「Hmm... Oh, I know! Why not ask Shinozaki to help you?」

Misa
「Marika-san? I would be very happy if she could help me... but is she not busy?」

％Ｂ
「I'll check. Just a moment, please.」
all
Marika
「Hello. I'm here to help Okihara-saaan.」
I contacted Shinozaki and she immediately came to the second chemistry classroom.
I think this should solve the problem of the naturalist club not having enough manpower.
Marika
「Let's both work together to make it a great display!」
Misa
「Yes! Let's make a very wonderful aquarium!」
The naturalist club is making a "mini aquarium."
I can clearly sense Okihara-senpai's determination to use this as the first step toward reopening Marinpia Shionagi.

％Ｂ
「We'll also help if there's anything we can do. Please don't hesitate to ask.」

Misa
「I have started to get very excited! I'm looking forward to what we'll be doing so very much!」

Natsuki
「Oh, I like it! Let's take a photo of things getting interesting for the naturalist club!」

all
％Ｂ
「What's wrong, Touko? You're kinda zoning out.」
Touko
「Huh? Ahaha, I'm fine. I was just thinking about how much fun Jellyfish-senpai looked like she was having.」


Misa
「Yes, I'm having so much fun! It feels as if I've gotten one step closer to my dream... I feel that succeeding with this display may allow me to take another, much larger step forward!」


Touko
「...Really.」
all
Natsuki
「Okay everyone, smile! Come on, Touko, a little further this way! 
I can't see you behind Hino!
I can't see you properly!
」

Touko
「I-I'm fine. I don't need to be in the photo, so it's okay.」
Natsuki
「What are you talking about? It's a good scene, so I need to get a proper photo.」
Touko
「Gh... B-But it's embarrassing.」
Natsuki
「Wait, you're so cute when you're blushing! Let me get a shot of that!」

Touko
「N-No, you can't! Stop it already! I don't have anything to do with thiiis!」

all
Misa
「Fufu. It's so very nice when it's lively here. It's always just me by myself.」

％Ｂ
「Let's have fun together. The preparations are the most fun part of a festival.」
Misa
「You're right. I may cause you trouble in the future, but I look forward to working with you.」

all
％Ｂ
「Touko? Is something up?」
Touko
「Huh? Oh, no... Nothing. Why?」
％Ｂ
「Because you've been real quiet... I thought you fell asleep, but you were just staring out the window.」

Touko
「Ahaha... I zoned out a bit because the weather's so nice.」
％Ｂ
「Just tell me if something's on your mind, all right? I'm...」
Touko
「...Camera-chan was so serious, wasn't she?」
％Ｂ
「What?」
Touko
「She's... She's like a different person when she's taking photos. I didn't know she could get that serious... I was surprised.」

％Ｂ
「Well of course she's serious. She's always talking about how good photography's decided in an instant. I can totally understand why she doesn't wanna compromise when it comes to something she loves to do.」


Touko
「That's true. You're really serious about architecture too
, Ryousuke-kun

.」

％Ｂ
「...Touko?」
Touko
「Flower-chan and Piano-chan... and Fluffyhead and Jellyfish-senpai all have something important to them. I'm the only one... with nothing.」


％Ｂ
「...」
I'm not with Touko so she can make faces like this.
I decided to be by her side... because I didn't want her to be sad.
My role is to support her.
I need to reassure her... so she can keep smiling, and stay the Touko I like.

％Ｂ
「Don't worry. You'll find something soon enough. Something important, with important feelings attached... There's no need to rush to find something. I told you we could find something together, didn't I?」


I hold her gently.
Her thin, small frame seems to be trembling just a bit in my arms.
Touko
「...Mhm.」
I wonder what I can do for her with the limited time we have.
I hold Touko's warmth close... and think to myself.
