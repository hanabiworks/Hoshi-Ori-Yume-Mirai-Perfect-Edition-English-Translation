The closing ceremony for the first semester ends, and we all gather in the committee office after one final homeroom session.

We start the full-scale preparations for the planetarium today.
Things seem nice, with everyone becoming more interested in stars after yesterday's stargazing session.

...Or so I thought, but...
％Ｂ
「Kinda seems like we've got two corpses in the room?」
Natsuki
「I mean, it's just that numbers can't really describe how talented I am, you knooow?」

Shuuichi
「I've got a girlfriend alreadyyy. I'm satisfied with just having a girlfrieeend. Being praised too much is only going to give birth to hubris which in turn ruins people anywayyy.」

They're saying weird things...
Misa
「How was your first grade report at our school?」
％Ｂ
「Oh yes, I was able to get average scores, thanks to Narusawa's notes and you going over past exam questions with me.」

all
Shuuichi
「Excuse meeeeee!? Past exam questions, what the hell!?」

Natsuki
「That's against the rules! You're cheating! It's a false start!」
％Ｂ
「Is it? It's just a way of getting an idea of how the exams go. And Shuuichi, you could've just gotten old exams from Kaori-san.」

Shuuichi
「You're right, I could'veeeeee! I'll be golden for second semester now!」

Natsuki
「Misa-san! Please give me the previous exams for midterms and finals for second semester!」
all
Sora
「...Thanks for waiting.」
％Ｂ
「Yo, Sora. How were your grades?」
Sora
「...Want to see?」
％Ｂ
「Can I?」
Sora
「...They're mostly all the same, so no issues.」
...The same?
I don't really get what that means, but I guess I'll take a look if she doesn't have any problems with it.

all
Sora takes her report card out from her bag and hands it to me.
％Ｂ
「Let's see......!!!?」
Wh-What on earth...? 10, 10, 10... Wait a second...
They're all 10s, other than a 6 in gym!?
I hear Shuuichi and Segawa's breaths catch behind me.
all
Sora
「...Same as always.」
She speaks quietly.
Wow... My girlfriend's really something...
all
％Ｂ
「Okay, so today we're all going to make the templates that we'll be using for cutting out the dome parts.」

We've moved to the old school building to start what we need to do to construct the planetarium.

Rikka
「We're not making the parts themselves?」
％Ｂ
「Not yet. We're just making templates for now. Though they're still going to be made from plastic boards.」

％Ｂ
「These templates need to be made precisely, or else the parts we cut out later are gonna be warped, and that'll ruin the shape of the dome. So we'll take our time to do this carefully.」



Sora
「...*nod*」
Sora
「...We made outlines on vellum paper, so cut the plastic boards according to those.」

all
％Ｂ
「I have the tools ready here. Use this cutting tool when you're cutting the plastic.」

Touko
「What is this tool? It has a weird shape. The tip's like a claw.」

％Ｂ
「It's a plastic cutter. The blade's only on that claw part, unlike normal cutting tools.」

Misa
「This seems rather interesting. Could you show us how to use it?」
％Ｂ
「Yes, of course.」
all
Everyone starts making templates under Sora's and my guidance.
Sora
「...Cut along the outsides of the outlines as accurately as possible.」
％Ｂ
「The trick is to trace over the same line you cut over and over, instead of trying to cut all the way through in one stroke.」

Rikka
「How is this?」
％Ｂ
「Ohh, looking pretty good. You're pretty good with your hands, Narusawa.」
all
Shuuichi
「I'm done! How's this, Ousaka?」

Sora
「...Terrible. Follow the vellum paper better.」
Shuuichi
「Gh... I-I'm very sorry...」
％Ｂ
「Man, you're unexpectedly bad at this kinda stuff...」
all
I cut out a template with the others.
Touko
「Huh... You're really good at that.」
％Ｂ
「Well, architectural models are my specialty.」
Touko
「Architectural models?」
Marika
「Yeah, he wants to become an architect.」
Touko
「Oh really... So then... maybe in the future, once Fluffyhead's your wife, you can design a real planetarium for her to be the director of, as her husband.」


％Ｂ
「H-Her husband...」
Sora
「...Wife...」
Marika
「Oh... Ousaka-san's bright red! She's so cute～♪」
Sora
「...Auh...」
She's frozen up...
Sora's actually pretty innocent, isn't she?
all
Natsuki
「I'm dooone! This time for sure, I'm done!」
Marika
「I am also done～」
all
Rikka
「Is this fine?」
Touko
「This looks good enough.」
all
Misa
「Is this to your liking, Sora-san?」
Shuuichi
「I did it right this time, right? Right?」
all
Sora
「...Mm.」
Sora gives everyone a thumbs-up after looking over the templates.
Sora
「...I'll handle the minor adjustments.」
Marika
「So we'll be actually cutting out the cardboard next, right?」
Natsuki
「Then we'll need to start getting the cardboard together tomorrow.」
all
Rikka
「We were talking about how we might run into some problems because the other clubs are probably going to look for cardboard at supermarkets and convenience stores, weren't we?」

Touko
「So then... Where's a good place to look?」
％Ｂ
「I've found a few decent-looking places for that.」
all
Misa
「Decent looking...?」
％Ｂ
「I picked out a few stores in the marketplace where we might be able to get cardboard while we were walking around there the other day.」

all
Shuuichi
「Hoh, nice job.」
％Ｂ
「Though it's not like I actually talked to them about it, so we won't know for sure until we actually go. I'll send everyone the list over LIME later.」


Marika
「Roger～」
all
Natsuki
「So how are things gonna go tomorrow?」
％Ｂ
「Let's all meet up at school first. Let's say 10 a.m., at the gates. How about we all split up to look for cardboard from there?」


all
Shuuichi
「What about your jobs?」
％Ｂ
「We're planning on finding one today or tomorrow. We'll have to interview once we know where we wanna apply, so Sora and I might have to duck out tomorrow. Sorry if that happens, but we'll be counting on you guys.」


all
I've been poring over the jobs pamphlet ever since I ate dinner today.

％Ｂ
「Hmm... None of them really stand out...」
But it's not like we can wait for much longer to make a decision, so we might have to start making a few compromises...

％Ｂ
「Hm? Who's that?」
I look at my phone.
It's a message from Sora.
【Sora】「Found a job」
【Sora】_st_0301
％Ｂ
「...Hmm!?」
I can't help but doubt my eyes.
【％Ｂ】「Seriously!? What kinda #Njob!?」
【Sora】「1,500 yen an hour, pays #Ndaily#NInterview tomorrow at #N11 a.m.」
【％Ｂ】「That's perfect! It even #Npays well! What do we #Nhave to do?」
【Sora】「Similar to customer #Nservice」
％Ｂ
「...Similar to customer service?」
I'm not really sure what to think about how vague that sounds...
％Ｂ
「And wait, can Sora even do customer service?」
【％Ｂ】「Just to make sure. #NYou're fine with this? #NCan you do customer #Nservice?」
I try imagining it in my head.
I just can't imagine it ever ending well...
【Sora】_st_0310
％Ｂ
「...She sure seems confident...」
Well, I'm sure it'll be fine if she says so.
