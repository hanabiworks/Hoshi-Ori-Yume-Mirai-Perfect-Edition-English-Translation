The next day.
Shuuichi
「...And so, as we do every year, we will be having event committee members take shifts to patrol throughout the school in order to promote safety at the Tanabata Festival.」


Yamashita-sensei
「Yes, I'd like to ask you to be thorough and careful with your patrolling, to prevent any incidents and accidents.」

Shuuichi
「Now then, that's almost everything for today...」
Shuuichi
「But there is one more thing. 

Hino and Shinozaki, the 
The 
two in charge of helping with the display for the naturalist club, have a proposal.」

Shuuichi
「They would like to have the extracurricular adviser, Yamashita-sensei, also hear this.」

Yamashita-sensei
「Me too? I understand.」
Shuuichi
「All yours.」
％Ｂ
「Thanks.」
all
Shinozaki and I stand up.
Okihara-senpai's sitting in a folding chair behind me.
She told me that she also wanted to be here for the meeting.
Natsuki
「Now then, it's your time to shine!」
Segawa's standing in the corner with her camera lens pointed at us, doing her duty as a grad-alb committee member.

all
％Ｂ
「I'm sure all of you are already aware, but the naturalist club has been preparing a collaborative display together with the astronomy club, a "sea full of stars."」


％Ｂ
「At the time, we were planning on using the second chemistry classroom, which is the naturalist club's clubroom.」

％Ｂ
「But considering the number of water tanks we have, as well as other circumstances, we have decided that a change of location would be ideal.」

％Ｂ
「However, all classrooms that we could potentially use have already been claimed by other parties, and we do not have many options.」


％Ｂ
「And so... the naturalist club would like to request permission to use a classroom in the old school building.」

Event Committee Member A
「The old school building?」
％Ｂ
「The old school building is currently off limits, but we would like to propose it to be temporarily reopened for the Tanabata Festival, if possible.」


Event Committee Member B
「The old school building... You're right, there are more than enough unused classrooms in there.」
％Ｂ
「Exactly. They are larger than the second chemistry classroom, and would provide ample space for our water tanks. Your thoughts?」

Now then... How's it gonna go?
Event Committee Member C
「Hmm... Well, I don't really think there are any issues...」
Oh?
Yamashita-sensei
「May I interject?」
％Ｂ
「Y-Yes, of course.」
Yamashita-sensei
「You wish to use a larger classroom because you are tight on space from the number of water tanks... I see the logic here, but in that case, why not simply reduce the number of tanks?」


I knew he'd ask that.
％Ｂ
「We considered that too, of course. But the naturalist club would like to have guests see as many fish as possible.」


％Ｂ
「We've discussed this with them, and they would like to not reduce the number of tanks.」

Yamashita-sensei
「Is there something that can be done about the layout of the tank placement? You could place them on the floor, or stack them on shelves.」

Marika
「We have to consider the presence of small children.」
Marika
「If children were to run about in the display area, they may bump into the tanks, or attempt to climb up onto the shelves. It opens up the possibility for accidents.」


Event Committee Member B
「You're right, that'd be bad...」
Natsuki
「Good going, Marika. Great follow-up!」
Marika
「Ehehe...」
all
％Ｂ
「Ahem... Additionally, the theme for our display is a "sea full of stars." The collaboration with the astronomy club will involve creating a display area that evokes a starry sky.」


％Ｂ
「And with that in mind, the old school building would be a more atmospheric venue than the second chemistry classroom, which has equipment for experiments placed throughout.」

Yamashita-sensei
「So what you're saying... is you'd like permission to use the old school building for atmosphere?」

％Ｂ
「Oh, no, that wouldn't be...」
Yamashita-sensei
「However, do you think it would really be okay for us to open up the use of the old school building exclusively for the naturalist club's use?」

Marika
「B-But like we said earlier, it's possible that children could be hurt in our current space... We cannot guarantee the location's safety.」


Yamashita-sensei
「If that's the case, then wouldn't it be all the more imperative to reduce the number of fish tanks to prioritize safety?」

Marika
「Auh...」
all
Yamashita-sensei
「And from the perspective of safety management, having a single display area separate from all the others isn't very ideal. It would be an unnecessary burden on the event committee's patrols.」


Yamashita-sensei
「We may have guests wander into other rooms in the old school building as well.」

％Ｂ
「I-If that's a concern, then we could have guidance signs or other people in the hallway to make sure guests can only go to the naturalist club's display...」

Yamashita-sensei
「...So you're asserting it's possible to set up countermeasures. It may be possible to guide them to some extent using pylons and rope...」


Yamashita-sensei
「But is there really a need to go that far? Pragmatically speaking, I think reducing the number of tanks would be a far better plan.」

Natsuki
「Oh dear... Things aren't looking too good.」
Marika
「Wh-What should we do～?」
％Ｂ
「Good question...」
all
We're gonna end up getting turned down, after Yukimura gave us the idea to use the old school building.

We need to do something to change the momentum...
Misa
「Excuse me... May I say something?」
％Ｂ
「Okihara-senpai?」
Yamashita-sensei
「And you are?」
Misa
「I am Okihara Misa, president of the naturalist club. I would like to provide a supplementary explanation on this matter.」


Yamashita-sensei
「I don't see why not. Go ahead.」
Misa
「Are you all aware of the kinds of fish that call Shionagi's sea home?」

She looks around at everyone and starts by asking a question.
I get it. Her plan's to get them to see her passion.\n\r
I don't know what the result might be in the end, but this might change things...
Misa
「I believe most of you do not. But I do not begrudge you for that. The reason for that would be because you have not had many opportunities to make contact with them.」


Misa
「Most opportunities to make contact with the ocean would be either fishing or going to the beach. However, not everyone goes fishing, and one most likely does not encounter fish when going to the beach.」


Misa
「So then what other opportunities could there be?」
She pauses and looks out over the audience.
I bet everyone's breath caught for an instant when those round eyes looked right into theirs.
Event Committee Member A
「U-Uhh... An opportunity to make contact with the ocean... Th-The aquarium... maybe?」
And as expected, one of the male students hesitantly offers up an answer.
Misa
「Yes, exactly!」
Misa
「An aquarium is a place that offers anyone and everyone the opportunity to make contact with the ocean. And there used to be an aquarium here in Shionagi called Marinpia Shionagi.」

Misa
「Unfortunately, Marinpia closed down... and thus, there are now fewer opportunities for people to know Shionagi's sea, to make contact with the ocean here.」


Misa
「I would like for everyone to know more about Shionagi's ocean. I am sure that if people know more about it, they will come to love it. They will come to love the town of Shionagi more and more.」


Misa
「Now that our aquarium is gone, I would like for as many people as possible to understand the wonder of the ocean... That is my fervent wish.」

Misa
「And for that purpose, I would like to request permission to use the old school building. Please.」

all
She bows her head deeply.
％Ｂ
「P-Please!」
Marika
「Please...!」
all
Shinozaki and I follow her lead.
Yamashita-sensei
「Hmm...」
Event Committee Member A
「Yeah, it's a shame that the aquarium's gone. I remember it was fun going there on field trips when I was small.」

Event Committee Member B
「It might be meaningful for teaching the kids too...」
Event Committee Member C
「But if we give out permission just this once, then there might be other clubs that want to use the old school building too... That might end up being a bit of an issue.」

％Ｂ
「...」
The audience's opinions are wavering.
It looks like the momentum's changed a bit, but...
Event Committee Member D
「Mmm, but you know...」
One of the students speaks up.
Event Committee Member D
「Marinpia went under because it wasn't popular, right? Maybe it's just that there aren't any people interested in going to the aquarium?」


％Ｂ
「...!?」
I'm sure he had no ill intent in saying that. He probably didn't think about it much at all.

But that only makes those words gouge even deeper into my chest.
％Ｂ
「U-Uh...」
I glance over at Okihara-senpai.
Misa
「...」
Her head's still down.
But her eyes are wide, and her lips are quivering slightly.
It's obvious that those words hit her hard.
all
Event Committee Member D
「Even if they use a big classroom and display lots of fish, there's no point if no one comes―」

％Ｂ
「N-No! But...!」
I shout and glare at him.
Event Committee Member D
「Wha...What...? Did I say something weird?」

Event Committee Member B
「Come on... I don't think you had to say it like that when there's a naturalist club member right there.」

Event Committee Member D
「U-Uhh～」
He looks a little uneasy after getting scolded by another committee member.
Marika
「U-Um... Calm down...」
In response to Shinozaki's words, I swallow down the words I was about to say.
There's no point in getting into an argument about Marinpia Shionagi here.

all
What should we do?
Shuuichi
「All right! Then let's continue this discussion next meeting!」
Event Committee Member C
「Huh? Wait a second, we can just decide on this now―」
Shuuichi
「Oh no, we have to keep to our schedule, so how about we just wrap things up for now? I'm sure Yamashita-sensei has work to do, and I've got a date with my girlfriend!」

Event Committee Member A
「Whaaaaat!? Y-You think you can end a meeting for a reason like―」

Shuuichi
「So anyway, that's the end of today's meeting! Okay everyone, great work today!」

all
Event Committee Member B
「Wha... Are you serious!?」
The tension immediately falls away in response to Shuuichi's words.
It actually has been a while since the meeting started, so the conversation immediately turns to closing talk.

Natsuki
「Looks like we were saved by Nirasawa. You'd probably have been turned down if he hadn't forced the meeting to a close just now.」


％Ｂ
「...That jackass, showing off again...」
all
But Segawa's right.
From the look of things, I'm also sure that it would've ended with us not getting permission to use the old school building.

％Ｂ
「So I guess we've managed to scrape by for now.」
Marika
「We'll have to prepare materials to convince everyone before the next meeting.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah... You're right.」
all
What should we do?
I guess we should talk things over with Okihara-senpai first...
％Ｂ
「...Okihara-senpai?」
Misa
「...」
She's sitting in the folding chair, hanging her head.
It's clear that she's still in shock from earlier.
all
I have Shinozaki and Segawa leave and stay back with Okihara-senpai in the committee room.

The rest of the event committee eventually also goes home, leaving just us two.

％Ｂ
「Uhh... Maybe we should start on our way too?」
Misa
「...」
％Ｂ
「We'll need to think on our plan for next meeting. Don't worry. I'm sure we'll find a way.」

Misa
「...」
％Ｂ
「Now then, let's watch those fish we're so proud of and put together a plan!」

Misa
「...」
％Ｂ
「Okihara-senpai? Senpaaaai?」
Misa
「...Oh! ...Y-Yes...」
She finally looks up with a gasp.
Misa
「Y-Yes... U-Um, I'm... Huh? What was it again...」

She looks confused, and a bit lost.
Misa
「H-Huh...? A-Ahahahaha... I-I'm sorry... It appears I'm a bit...」

I notice her fingers are shaking a bit.
Looks like she's still not over it.
％Ｂ
「Okihara-senpai...」
Misa
「E-Excuse me... U-Umm...」
％Ｂ
「Honestly now... Come on!」
I get up, grab her by the arms, and force her out of the chair.
％Ｂ
「We're going!」
Misa
「Wha...?」
％Ｂ
「To the roof!」
Misa
「The roof...?」
I pull her by the hand up to the rooftop. Ousaka's there, looking through her telescope.

Sora
「...」
She tilts her head in confusion at our sudden appearance.
％Ｂ
「Sorry about this, Ousaka. Could we get some time alone for just a second?」
Misa
「...」
Sora
「...*nod*」
She immediately nods and leaves the rooftop. She must've known from Okihara-senpai's expression that something was up.

％Ｂ
「Phew... Now then.」
I let go of Okihara-senpai's hand and look at her.
％Ｂ
「...How long are you planning on being depressed for?」
Misa
「It's...」
％Ｂ
「Okihara-senpai!」
Misa
「...Huh?」
％Ｂ
「This isn't like you!!!」
％Ｂ
「The Okihara-senpai I know is cheerful, and always smiling, always positive... She's someone that's passionate and always moving forward!」


％Ｂ
「You can't get depressed about something like that... It's just not like you, Okihara-senpai!」

％Ｂ
「You're the experienced lady among us! So come on, let's get it together!」

Misa
「...」
I'm trying to use some overly forceful words to scold her.
It's Okihara-senpai we're talking about here.
I'm sure she's gonna respond with something like, "Yes, you're right!" and smile―

Misa
「Sniff...」
％Ｂ
「Uh...」
Misa
「Hgh... I...I'm... sorry... Sniff...」
％Ｂ
「W-Wait, what...!?」
Tears run down her cheeks.
Misa
「Sniff... B-But... It-It isn't like... I'm... always smil...ing... Sniff... Hgh...」

％Ｂ
「No, well, uh...」
...I didn't expect this.
I can't believe she started crying.
She's sobbing like a little kid.
Misa
「Sniff... And... you said... I'm the experienced... one... b...but... I'm only... a year... older... uuhh...」

％Ｂ
「U-Um... Uh... I'm sorry... I said something rude...」
Misa
「Sniff... A-Auuh...」
％Ｂ
「B-But... you don't really need to worry about it. That was just someone who didn't know anything talking...」

Misa
「...」
％Ｂ
「They don't know anything. They don't know how great Marinpia was as an aquarium. They're just saying random stuff without knowing anything.」


％Ｂ
「I know really well just how great that aquarium was! So you don't need to worry about that, and―」

She interrupts me by slowly shaking her head.
Misa
「What they were saying... is the truth. Marinpia... closed down... due to years of poor business... There was no interest...」


Misa
「That part... isn't... wrong at all. It's something... that everyone thinks... It-It's just that... he just said what was on his mind...」


％Ｂ
「B-But you can't acknowledge that, Okihara-senpai.」
Misa
「But... it's the truth.」
％Ｂ
「That's...」
I want to say she has no reason to cry.
But I can't come up with any words to do so with.
The realization crushes down on me too.
Misa
「It's fine... I already know... everything...」
Misa
「I'm worried that even if we do an aquarium for Tanabata... th-the guests might not enjoy it... No one may come... It makes me so sad...」


％Ｂ
「No, that's not true! I'm sure that lots of guests would come!」

Misa
「That would be nice... but... I'm... starting to lose confidence...」

％Ｂ
「Okihara-senpai...」
I've never seen her so frail-hearted before.
It's a new side to her... but I really don't want to see it.
Misa
「...I'm sorry. I can't be saying something like this when you're all doing everything you can to help with the Tanabata Festival preparations...」


Misa
「E-Ehehe... I'm a failure as the experienced lady of the group, aren't I?」
She finally smiles, but her smile's still a sad one.

all
％Ｂ
「...」
I don't have anything else I can say to her...
All I can do is bite my lip before her.
That night, I decided to look up Marinpia Shionagi on the internet.
The official site comes up right away when I search for it.
％Ｂ
「"We will be closing"... I see.」
There's a lonesome notice at the top of the website about how the aquarium is to close down in May.

The article states, like Okihara-senpai said, that it would be due to an extended period of poor business.

％Ｂ
「Was it really that unpopular? ...I feel like it was pretty full back when we went on a field trip there in grade school...」


I look through the website's gallery of the aquarium interior and the fish they had.

I don't have any specific memories from grade school, but I recognize all of the locations in the photos from back when Okihara-senpai guided me through before.

％Ｂ
「Hm...?」
There's a button in the site navigation menu that says "Guest Comments."

I click on it.
I'm taken to what looks like a forum where sitegoers can directly submit comments.

％Ｂ
「Huh, I didn't know they had something like this. Let's see here...」
"I'm very sorry to hear that you will be closing in May. Thank you very much for all of the wonderful memories."

"I went on my first date with my girlfriend at Marinpia Shionagi. I'm sad that a place that holds such good memories for me is going to be gone!"

"Please reopen one day. I'll always be waiting."
The forums have several comments bemoaning the aquarium's closure.
The most recent comment is from the end of June.
Just a few days ago.
％Ｂ
「What the heck... It was way more popular than people said.」
Okihara-senpai said the aquarium closed because of years of poor business.
That guy from the event committee said it wasn't popular too.
But judging from these comments, I can't believe that at all.

Though I doubt it's a lie or anything, since the aquarium did actually close down.
And I'm sure it's true that business wasn't great too.
But...
％Ｂ
「I wonder just how bad it was...」
Was business really bad enough that it had to close? ...What were their losses like?
What'd their guest counts look like over time?
And what was the cause of all this?
More and more questions pop up in my head.
％Ｂ
「Maybe if we figure out the answers, we could use them to help make the mini aquarium a success.」

And that means Okihara-senpai can smile from the bottom of her heart again!

％Ｂ
「All right... I'll look into it for a bit.」
I begin tapping away at the keys again.
