Shionagi Academy in the early morning.
$$smh_OpenCHK
There are hardly any students around. I'll be able to focus on searching for the key.
％Ｂ
「Dammit... This is the downside to going to a huge school...!」
I'm going to look everywhere I have even the slightest possibility of finding the key.
Which means I'm going to search the entire school.
It'll be rough doing this on my own, but I can't just sit back and do nothing.
I decide to look through spots in the reverse order from yesterday.
Time passes, and more students arrive at school.
I'm getting worried.
It's not like the entire student population knows about the key... Someone might've disposed of it.

【Touko】「Where are you? The old #Nschool building's #Nlocked.」
【％Ｂ】「I had something to do #Non the grounds.」
【％Ｂ】「I have to head to the #Nevent committee office #Nright now, so let's #Nmeet up there.」
【Touko】「Okay. I'll head over #Nnow.」
％Ｂ
「...」
I head toward the event committee office, praying for someone to have turned the key in.
Touko
「Morning. It's really hot today, isn't it?」
％Ｂ
「Y-Yeah.」
I thought she'd be depressed, but she's smiling cheerily at me.
I was worrying about how to cheer her up, but...
Touko
「Are you done with whatever Four-Eyes-kun told you to do? What was it?」
％Ｂ
「Mm, just a minor thing. I think I've gotten to a good stopping point with it.」
Touko
「Oh, okay. You must be tired. Let's take it easy until lunch today.」
％Ｂ
「Uh... You okay? We haven't found the key yet...」
Touko
「It's just the key to a building that's going to be torn down soon anyway. What's gone is gone.」

％Ｂ
「...Isn't it too early to give up? You only lost it two days ago...」

Touko
「I think it might've just been fate. Anyway, didn't you have something to talk to Four-Eyes-kun about? I'll be waiting here, so why don't you go on in?」


Shuuichi
「How's it going? Find the key?」
％Ｂ
「...No, not yet. You haven't gotten any info either?」
Shuuichi
「No. I'll talk to some people today too, so I'll let you know if I hear anything.」
The lost-and-found network that I was counting on hasn't turned up any leads.
So maybe that means she didn't drop it at school...?
％Ｂ
「That'd be great. Sorry for making you do this when you're busy, Shuuichi.」
Shuuichi
「Just pay me back by working hard to make up for it. I think I'd get a lot of use out of having you owe me.」

％Ｂ
「...I'll pay by installments. No interest.」
all
％Ｂ
「...Touko. You listening?」
Touko
「Huh? I-I'm listening! We're talking about our work today, right!?」
％Ｂ
「You all right? You were pretty out of it.」
Touko
「A-Ahaha...! It's nothing! I just didn't get enough sleep last night. Don't worry, okay?」

I can tell the loss of the key's really gotten to her after all from the way she's acting.\n\r

She probably really didn't get enough sleep last night because of the key.
I want to do something for her.
I―
I'll go search for the key by myself.
I'll look for the key together with Touko.
I decided that I would support Touko.
Staying silent while Touko's trying to force herself to give up goes against that vow.

％Ｂ
「All right. Anyway, you're in charge of the old school building again today. I'm gonna go do some stuff outside.」

Touko
「Mhm, good luck. I'll do work while I wait.」
I retrace our steps from two days ago.
I recall as much of Touko's movements as possible and look through every spot where the key could've fallen out from her pocket.

I don't have any idea what the most likely spot it could be is. I'm getting frantic.
It's a relatively big key. I should be able to spot it at a glance...!

％Ｂ
「Wait, that cat...?」
Isn't that the same cat that Touko was playing with downtown a while ago?
I can't really tell cats apart, but I think this one's the same color, at least.
I feel like I remember... Touko feeding him and petting him...
％Ｂ
「Ahhhhh!!」
The cat's got something in his mouth.
An old key with a familiar shape―Touko's key!
％Ｂ
「Stoooop! Give that key baaack!」
I sprint after the cat.
The cat freezes when I begin chasing after him and runs away.

％Ｂ
「I'm not letting you get away! I'm gonna get you no matter what!!」
I'm playing a serious game of tag with a cat for the first time in my life.
The battle moves from the main gates to the school grounds.
％Ｂ
「Wait, dammiiiit! Let go of that keeey!」
Cats are fast...!
I know I'll lose sight of him if he runs toward the hills or somewhere else outside the school.

I need to end this here...!
I have to catch up to do that...!
％Ｂ
「Hahh... hahh...! Dammit, I can't catch up...!」
I can't close the distance at all. It's taking everything I've got just to keep chasing after the cat without losing sight of him as he tries to hide.

If only I had something I could use to scare him from afar...!
％Ｂ
「Gh... That'll work...!」
There are a bunch of volleyballs on the ground. Probably something for some club's Tanabata Festival display.

I change course and run toward the balls.
It's only a distance of about thirty meters. If I do this with everything I've got―I can make it!
％Ｂ
「Goooooo...!」
I apologize in my heart to the club that had gotten these out and to the cat as I heave with my right leg.

I follow the ball's arc with my gaze, praying for it to land near the cat―!
％Ｂ
「...Wha!?」
I kicked exactly according to my muscle memory.
I didn't have any time to focus myself on the kick. I'm not wearing spikes so I couldn't center my balance properly either. It should've been a sloppy shot.

But the ball flies in an unbelievably precise arc toward the cat.

Since when did I have such a great kick!?
Did my placekicking ability level up on its own without me even doing anything!?

The ball veers to the left as it falls.
It falls a bit short of where I was aiming... but it slams into the ground harder than I was expecting too.

％Ｂ
「...He dropped it!」
Something falls from the cat's mouth as he yowls in response and runs away.

I run over and pick up the key.
％Ｂ
「Yeah. This is the key. Thank god I found it.」
I wonder if that cat was carrying it around to a bunch of different places as a toy?
That explains why we couldn't find the key. It was moving around the whole time.
I head over to recover the volleyball I kicked too.
Gotta make sure I put it back where I found it.
Still, though... that was a hell of a kick just now.
I guess it's something like I unlocked my hidden potential when I really needed it?
％Ｂ
「...These things are softer than I thought.」
I press my fingers into the volleyball. They sink in pretty far.\n\r

Huh... I never knew they were this soft.
...I get it. This is why that kick was so impressive.
Kicking a ball this soft would let you get a lot more force and control behind your kick.
I was kicking this with a soccer ball in mind, which is probably how it ended up being such a curved shot.

％Ｂ
「Hmmh... Here I was thinking I could join the national team for a second.」
Either way, I've found the key.
Let's hurry and get this back to Touko.
％Ｂ
「Here. Try not to drop it again, all right?」
Touko
「Wha...? H-How...? This is my key...!」
％Ｂ
「I finally found it. I found a cat holding it in his mouth... I think he was that one that you were playing with forever ago.」


Touko
「...Really. What a rascal.」
Seeing her grip the key tight reassures me.
I knew it. This key... is something irreplaceably precious for her.

％Ｂ
「All right. Let's finish this up. We need to tell everyone that we found it.」

all
I'll tell Shuuichi first and have him let the rest of the committee know.
It'd be great if we could thank everyone directly... but going around to thank them would take an entire day on its own.

％Ｂ
「We should thank Shinozaki and the others too. They'd probably be happier if you told them yourself.」

Touko
「...I don't really know how I should say it, so could you help me?」

％Ｂ
「Sure. Let's think about it together. I'm gonna let Shuuichi know first.」
Touko
「And... I have something I want to tell everyone. So... we should do all this in person.」

I receive Touko's message of gratitude that she thought so hard over.
I've been included in the recipient list, along with everyone else.
【Touko】「％Ｂ-kun has found #Nmy key. Thank you all #Nfor searching for it.」
【Touko】「I want to thank you all #Nin person, and I have #Nsomething important to #Ntalk about. Are you #Nfree for lunch today?」
％Ｂ
「Touko. Let's go look for it together afterward. You're thinking about the key, right?」

Touko
「...No, it's okay. We won't get any work done if we spend any more time looking for it.」

I want to do something for her, but I can't think of any other place it could possibly be.

all
【Shuuishi】「Someone found a key #Nthat looks like the one #Nyou're looking for. We #Nhave it in the #Ncommittee office.」
％Ｂ
「Seriously!? Touko, they apparently found the key!」
Touko
「What!? Really...!?」
％Ｂ
「They apparently have it in the event committee office. Let's go right now and check!」

％Ｂ
「Shuuichi! Where's the key!?」
Shuuichi
「Whoa!? You scared me!」
Now isn't the time to worry about the attention we're getting from the other committee members.
Shuuichi
「Here, isn't this it? It was just turned in as something someone lost. I knew this was what you were looking for. Looks exactly like how you described it.」


％Ｂ
「That's it! Where was it!?」
Shuuichi
「In the courtyard. Apparently a stray cat was carrying it around in its mouth.」

Touko
「A stray cat? ...Maybe it was that one from before.」
As in... the one Touko was playing with downtown forever ago?
Well, that explains why we couldn't find it at all. The key was moving around constantly.

Shuuichi
「An underclassman turned it in because they heard a rumor that someone was looking for a key. I already thanked them for you, so there's no need to worry about that.」


％Ｂ
「That's great, Touko. We found the key.」
Touko
「...Mhm.」
Shuuichi
「What's wrong? You finally found your key, but you don't seem too happy.」

Touko
「Oh, no... That's not true. I'm very sorry for all the trouble.」
Shuuichi
「No need to worry about thanking me, I'll have this guy make up for it. Isn't that right?」
％Ｂ
「...I don't like the looks of that smile. Like I said, I'm paying you back in installments.」
Shuuichi
「Regardless, that's case closed. Feel free to continue working without any worries now.」

％Ｂ
「I can't believe it was 'cause of a stray cat. Of course we couldn't find it.」

Touko
「...I caused lots of trouble. Flower-chan and the others and even people I don't know were helping me... What should I do?」

％Ｂ
「You don't need to think that hard. Just give them a simple "thank you."」

Touko
「...Is that really enough? Isn't there... something else that I should do on top of that?」

％Ｂ
「If you want to do something more, then just tell them. If you wanna thank Shinozaki and the others... I know. How about you make lunch for them or something?」


Touko
「...Is it okay to only do that much?」
％Ｂ
「This kinda stuff's all about the sentiment. It's not like they helped us 'cause they wanted a reward. They were doing it for you.」


Touko isn't used to interacting with others.
Now that I'm looking back on it, the key's disappearance might've been a happy little accident to get Touko to grow more as a person.

％Ｂ
「You should thank them first. Let's send them a message.」

Touko
「Um... How should I word it...? Could you help me think about it?」

％Ｂ
「Sure. Let's go back to the old school building together to think about it, then.」
Touko
「...And one more thing. There's something I have to tell everyone about... This is a good opportunity, so I'll do my best.」

I receive Touko's message of gratitude that she thought so hard over.
I've been included in the recipient list, along with everyone else.
【Touko】「My key has been found. #NThank you all for #Nhelping us look for it.」
【Touko】「I want to thank you in #Nperson, and I have #Nsomething important to #Ntalk about. Do you all #Nhave time today during #Nlunch?」
Natsuki
「So what'd you wanna talk about? Are you two finally getting married?」
Misa
「Whaaat!? Th-The two of you have already progressed so...!? I see... Congratulations!」

all
Marika
「A-Ahaha... Senpai, it's definitely too early for that... Right?」
Rikka
「D-Don't ask me. Though I don't think it's unheard of for people to get married while they're still in high school.」

all
％Ｂ
「Touko. Come on.」
Touko
「O-Okay...」
Touko's nervous. I cheer her on in my heart.
Maybe she knows how I feel. She looks at me, gives a tiny nod, and takes a deep breath.

Touko
「Um, first... I'm sorry. I lost my key because I wasn't careful enough, and I had you all help me look for it... I apologize for the trouble I've caused.」


all
Marika
「You don't have to worry about that. It's great that you found it, Yukimura-san.」

Rikka
「She's right. We haven't done anything you need to formally thank us for.」
all
Sora
「...Ritsu was wandering around with her eyes to the ground the whole time. She kept running into people while she was looking for your key.」

Rikka
「...Hgh. Ousaka-san, I thought I said we were keeping that a secret!?」
Sora
「...Never said I would.」
all
Natsuki
「You were trying really hard too, Misa-san. I saw you asking the other third years to help.」

Misa
「I simply wished to do the most I could... I know very well the pain of losing something precious to you.」


all
Touko
「I'm so grateful to all of you. Thank you all so very much.」
She lowers her head a little.
She keeps her serious expression as everyone smiles at her, and continues.
Touko
「And... there's one more thing I want to talk about. I'm going to be moving again. I think... I'll be leaving Shionagi by the end of August.」


Marika
「What!? That soon...!?」
Natsuki
「Wait, so you're only going to be here for one more month!? Why didn't you tell us this until now!?」

Touko
「It was only decided recently. My dad works for a newspaper company... and he's always had to move around a lot for work.」

Misa
「There is nothing that can be done if it is a matter of your father's work... but it is very saddening. For us, of course, but also...」

all
Everyone looks at me.
They all know about our relationship. It's the obvious reaction.
all
Touko
「So I'll be saying goodbye to all of you soon. Thank you very much for everything.」

Sora
「...We'll be lonely.」
all
Natsuki
「Okaaaay then, I understand! We're going to have fun together every day after the Tanabata Festival, then! Who cares about summer homework!?」


Marika
「You have to do your homewooork...! And we'd be getting in their way...」

Natsuki
「Summer homework's something you do after summer break's over! Having fun with Touko's more important!」

Touko
「Wha, but...」
all
Rikka
「That sounds just like you, Segawa-san. Just so you know, I won't be letting you copy off my homework.」


Natsuki
「Wha, you're kidding! Ahh, but we're going to invite you out every day too, so I don't think you're going to have the time to be doing homework!?」

Rikka
「I won't be there every day. We need to give the two of them time for each other, don't we?」

Sora
「Ritsu's spending nights stargazing with me. She won't have much time to sleep.」
Rikka
「Wha, that's news to me... Geez. Is it that fun for you people to swing me around all over the place like this?」

Natsuki
「It sure is. Right, Sora?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
all
Marika
「Yukimura-san, I know you might be busy with preparing to move, but let's have lots of fun together. I'd be really happy if you could make lots of good memories of Shionagi.」


Misa
「Perhaps we could all go to the beach together? I would like to make the time to go with everyone.」

Natsuki
「The beach, that's great! It's a must-have for the springtime of youth! Misa-san, Touko, you'll be wearing bikinis, right!?」

all
Touko
「...」
Misa
「Natsuki-san, you're making Touko-san uncomfortable. Fufu, I'm very much looking forward to it.」

See? You didn't need to worry, Touko.
Everyone cares about you so much.
％Ｂ
「Come on, let's all hang out together. We're all waiting for your response.」
Touko
「...Mm. It'll only be for a little while longer, but I'll be in your care.」
％Ｂ
「Hey, Touko. Mind if I ask you something?」
Touko
「Mm, what is it?」
％Ｂ
「That key... Why's it so important to you? Do you associate something important with it or something...?」

I've been wondering all this time.
Why does she even have that key to the old school building?
Considering how she was acting when she lost it, I can only think there's something deeper to it.

Touko
「Mmm... I don't really like doing it... but how about I talk about the past a bit?」

all
Touko
「This key's from my mom and dad... I got it from my parents when we moved here to Shionagi.」

％Ｂ
「From your parents? So that means... your parents are from Shionagi?」

Touko
「Seems like it. I didn't know until we moved here, though.」

Touko's moved from place to place throughout her life.
I'm sure her parents would've been looking forward to coming back to Shionagi if it was where they spent their days as students.
Touko
「Do you remember that time capsule from before? I saw my dad's name on that signature card... It surprised me.」


％Ｂ
「Wow, what a coincidence. Oh... So that's why you were acting kinda weird back then?」

Touko
「Ahaha... My dad wrote in, "I'll become a great journalist someday" with his signature. He had a proper dream back when he was my age... and made it come true... It surprised me.」


％Ｂ
「Right, you said earlier that your dad works at a newspaper company.」

Touko
「Mhm. Journalists apparently have to move around a lot for work. They spend maybe two years at most in a city before moving again.」

％Ｂ
「Wha...? So then why's it so soon this time!? You haven't even been here for half a year!」

Touko
「I didn't ask for details, but it seems like it's a special appointment. I don't want to get in the way of my dad's dream... so there's nothing I really can do.」

％Ｂ
「...And you're really okay with that...!?」
Touko
「...Then, 
Ryousuke-kun, 

if your own child told you, "Quit being an architect"... What would you do?」

％Ｂ
「Gh... I...!」
I can't say anything.
It's not the kind of question I could answer... as someone who hasn't shouldered the responsibility of a real job, or raised a child.

Touko
「My dad tries really hard. He's really nice, and he never forgets to think about me or my mom even though he's so busy... I'm really proud he's my dad.」


％Ｂ
「Touko...」
Touko
「And my mom supports him while she works her own job, and she does all the housework too. She's amazing.」

Touko
「I love both of them, and I respect them too. That's why... I can't be selfish.」

It's not that she's given up.
It's more like... she's just accepted moving as something that's completely natural.

Touko
「A person's dreams are really important to them, right? I... can't get in the way or ruin them by being selfish.」


She seems a little sad.
Is it because she's holding different emotions from before in her heart...?
Touko
「It's like everyone's got their own dreams and goals, and they're moving forward... and they're leaving just me behind. That's why I've always wanted a place of my own.」


％Ｂ
「And that's... the old school building?」
Touko
「Mhm. I was a bit happy when the key my dad gave me actually unlocked the door. There was no one else there... It felt like it was just for me. A place that accepted me.」


A quiet place to be alone.
A place where she didn't have to think about her surroundings... That's probably why this place became so precious to her.

Touko
「So when someone else came in here... I was honestly really annoyed. There were times when I thought about never talking to you ever again.」


％Ｂ
「...Seriously? Wait, so was I being kind of a jerk?」
Touko
「Ahaha, maybe. But thinking back on it now... I think that was a good thing. Because we wouldn't be able to be here together like this otherwise, right?」


I wonder what would've happened... if I had chosen not to come here as much, or if she had said, "Never come here again!"

I probably would've helped with the Tanabata Festival preparations as part of the event committee without having anything to do with this building.

And Touko would still be alone now... and she would've moved away without telling anyone.

Touko
「When I lost the key... I got really scared. I started feeling like this old school building would disappear too... Ahaha, though I know that wouldn't happen.」


％Ｂ
「No, I get what you mean. It means this place is just that important to you.」

Touko
「More and more thoughts like that kept popping up in my head. I felt like I was going to lose everything like I lost the key. I started regretting that I became connected with everyone.」


Touko
「When everyone else said they'd help look for it... I started feeling a lot of pressure. Ahaha. I couldn't sleep at all last night.」


％Ｂ
「...」
Touko
「I was really relieved when we found the key... but I got scared again right away. My legs started to shake when I realized that I needed to thank everyone properly.」


％Ｂ
「It's just saying "thank you"... but that's hard for you to do, isn't it?」

Touko
「Mhm... To be honest... I didn't know how I should face the others. I couldn't stop thinking about how I might've been a bother. How maybe they didn't really want to help.」


She may have accepted her relationship with me, but her relationships with the others around her probably haven't really sunk in for her yet.

Even though... those bonds are so much stronger than Touko thinks they are.
If Touko could just acknowledge that... then I'm sure her world would become so much bigger, and more fun.

Touko
「...I don't really know how to say it well, but that's what it's like. Ahaha, I never really liked doing this... Talking about myself.」

What should I do for Touko?
What can I do for her? What can I do in general?
Touko
「...Today's the end of July.」
The Tanabata Festival's in a week.
The deadline for my promise with Touko.
Touko
「Okay, let's head home. Tomorrow's probably going to be busy.」
We don't have much time left, and we have event committee work too.
Time passes even while I'm worrying over what I should do.\n\r
I'm feeling rushed, but I desperately try to maintain my composure and think.
％Ｂ
「It'd be best if we could give form to Touko's bonds with everyone... Maybe we could try writing letters and signing a card like that time capsule...?」


That might be a good idea, but we'd only be able to do that for those of us who are especially close to her.\n\r

I'd have to get a bunch of sheets of signature cardstock too. It's a bit inefficient.
I'd want it to be more like something that only we could do.
I want to present Touko with something so impactful that she wouldn't be able to forget us even if she wanted to.

...Maybe I should ask the others?
I'm sure they'd help. We could think of something before the Tanabata Festival...

％Ｂ
「...That's right, the Tanabata Festival! It might be a lot of work to gather all the materials, but if it works, then...!」


It'd be completely impossible to pull off on my own.
But getting lots of people to help would make it all the more meaningful.\n\r
It's got to be the best plan possible for showcasing our bonds.
I start looking stuff up on the internet.
I need to look into some things.
There's something I can do for Touko... Let's do it the best I can.
