It's the last day of the first semester.
We head back to our classroom for the final homeroom of the semester after the closing ceremony.

％Ｂ
「Man, I can't believe first semester's over already.」
Rikka
「You weren't even here for the first two months.」
％Ｂ
「Sure, but you know... It's already been more than a month since I transferred in. Time really flies.」
Marika
「Oh, hello～」
all
％Ｂ
「Hey.」
Touko
「I don't get to see you two together like this too often.」
％Ｂ
「Right back at you.」
Marika
「Where's Segawa-san?」
％Ｂ
「I remember she was taking lots of photos of the closing ceremony. Maybe she's still in the gym?」

％Ｂ
「You need something from her?」
all
Marika
「Yukimura-san and I were talking about how we should all go have fun somewhere again over summer break, so I was going to ask her about it.」


％Ｂ
「Oh... Sorry, but I dunno if we'll be able to do that until after the festival. She still has to take photos for the astronomy club.」

Marika
「Mhm. We know she's busy, of course, so after the festival's okay. We want Okihara-san and Ousaka-san to join us too anyway.」


％Ｂ
「I'll talk to her about it, then.」
Touko
「You don't have to, if you two want to spend all summer break by yourselves.」

％Ｂ
「No, that's...」
all
Not too implausible, I guess...
But I can't help but feel that if that happened, all we'd do is stay inside and do dirty stuff the entire time...

％Ｂ
「...That's way too unhealthy...! We'll definitely come with you guys!」

Marika
「O-Okay... Got it... I'll talk to you at the committee meeting after homeroom, then.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, see ya.」
all
Shuuichi
「The closing ceremony's over... but, I'll have you all know! We of the event committee know no summer break!」

Event Committee Members A B C
「Yessir!」
％Ｂ
「Y-Yes, sir...」
Marika
「Yes siiir.」
Shuuichi
「We of the event committee must offer all of our time for the sake of the Tanabata Festival!」


Event Committee Members A B C & Marika
「Yessir!」
％Ｂ
「Sh-Shinozaki!!? Y-Yes, sir!」
Shuuichi
「Surely there aren't any of you who have slackened just because it's summer break...?」

Shuuichi
「"It's summer break, so let's go to the beach togetheeer"... None of you are thinking anything naive like that, are you!?」

Event Committee Members A B C & Marika
「No, sir!」
Shuuichi
「And that is why you are event committee members! Rouse yourselves for the coming Tanabata Festival!」

Event Committee Members A B C & Marika
「Sir, yessir!」
Shuuichi
「Dismissed!」
all
Natsuki
「Mmmh... You guys are always so dumb. It's great.」
all
％Ｂ
「H-Hey... What the heck was that?」
Shuuichi
「It's like a traditional ritual for us. We do this every year on the last day of the first semester.」


Marika
「I was surprised because it was so sudden.」
％Ｂ
「You were pretty into it.」
Marika
「Ehehe, it was kind of fun.」
Shuuichi
「Though once summer break starts, we won't have time to rest because we'll be busy with festival preparations. Half of that was to tell people not to get too comfortable, and the other half was just messing around.」


％Ｂ
「You were more into it than anyone else.」
Natsuki
「It's great working with the event committee 'cause I get to see fun scenes like that.」

Shuuichi
「So anyway, what are your plans for break looking like? I'm talking about committee work, obviously.」

Marika
「I'm going to be coming to school almost every day to help prepare the display and take care of the fish. And Okihara-san is too, of course.」


Shuuichi
「What about you
, Ryousuke

?」
％Ｂ
「Natsuki has to get the photos for the astronomy club. She'll have to take them at night, so I'll be with her for sure 'cause it's dangerous for her to be alone.」


Shuuichi
「Think you'll make it in time?」
Natsuki
「I can't say anything since I haven't tried taking the photos yet. But it'd be bad if we don't make it in time, right?」

Shuuichi
「Pretty much. I'm counting on the three of you, then.」
Ryousuke & Marika & Natsuki
「Yessir!」
％Ｂ & Marika & Natsuki
「Yessir!」
Natsuki and I decide to go home together after parting ways with Shinozaki, who said she was going to go check up on the fish.

％Ｂ
「The bus timing's a little weird right now... We might have to wait a while.」
Natsuki
「Let's walk for part of the way, then.」
％Ｂ
「Uh... Seriously?」
Natsuki
「Why not walk every now and then? Summer break starts tomorrow!」
％Ｂ
「I don't really get the logic... but whatever.」
％Ｂ
「...But man, you're really taking photos of everything.」
Natsuki
「Pretty much. I have to take photos the moment I think of it, or else I'll let opportunities slip by.」

She walks in front of me, turns around and starts walking backward as she clicks the shutter at me.

％Ｂ
「Hey, be careful.」
Natsuki
「Don't worry, don't... Bwaaahhh!?」
％Ｂ
「Hey!」
Of course, Natsuki trips over something and starts falling.
I reach out and grab her arm on reflex.
Natsuki
「Safe...」
％Ｂ
「No, not safe... I told you to watch out.」
Natsuki
「Ahaha... But I got a great shot of you desperately trying to save me.」

The image on the camera's screen is a photo of me frantically reaching out to grab her.

Natsuki
「Ehehe... It's a moment that really shows how much you care about me.」
％Ｂ
「Dumbass...」
I smack her on the forehead with a chop.
％Ｂ
「It's fine to get into your photography like that, but make sure you're aware of your surroundings. You're gonna end up really hurt otherwise.」

％Ｂ
「Remember how you fell down the stairs 'cause you were walking backward the first time we met?」

Natsuki
「Right, right. And then you grabbed my boob～」
％Ｂ
「That was out of my con─no, I'm telling you that you need to be more careful.」

Natsuki
「I'll be fine.」
％Ｂ
「On what basis?」
Natsuki
「'Cause I have you now. You saved me just now, didn't you?」

％Ｂ
「...That's just not fair.」
Natsuki
「Thanks for saving me... Chu♪」
She kisses me on the cheek.
％Ｂ
「S-Sure...」
I must be real simple if this is all it takes to get me to forgive her for anything...

Natsuki
「I feel like I'll be able to take any photos I want if I'm with you
, Ryousuke

.」

％Ｂ
「You're thinking too highly of me... Oh, by the way, what kinda cameraman are you planning on being when you're older?」

Natsuki
「What do you mean? A cameraman's a cameraman.」
％Ｂ
「But there's all kinds, right? Like scenery specialists, animal specialists, or modeling types, or journalism types.」

Natsuki
「I could even be a battlefield photographer with you around.」
％Ｂ
「I dunno if I can live up to that level of trust...」
Natsuki
「Mmm... A photography genre, huh... I really just want to take photos of everything... but if I had to say, maybe something like a hyper-multimedia cameraman?」


％Ｂ
「The heck's with that shady-sounding title... That's not any kinda cameraman I've ever heard of.」
Natsuki
「An all-around-specialist cameraman then.」
％Ｂ
「Shadier and shadier.」
Natsuki
「I can't help it. I wanna be a cameraman who can take photos of anything.」
％Ｂ
「Isn't it more professional-like to specialize?」
Natsuki
「Mmh... You have a point...」
Natsuki
「That's a hard question. I can't think of anything right now, but I feel like I'll come across something that really clicks for me someday, so I think I'll have to defer my answer for now.」


Natsuki
「What about you? What kinda architect do you wanna be?」
％Ｂ
「What do you mean? An architect's an architect.」
Natsuki
「Aren't there different kinds of architects too? Like regular buildings, or apartments, or houses, or artsy stuff.」

％Ｂ
「Let me think... I wanna be an architect who could design any kind of building... A hyper-multidesign architect.」

Natsuki
「What the heeeck. Don't just imitate me, geez.」
％Ｂ
「If I'm gonna be serious, I guess I wanna be an architect like Azuma Morio.」
Natsuki
「I understand that one even less.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, come on. You too? Azuma Morio's the most famous architect in Shionagi.」

％Ｂ
「His cutting-edge interpretations and bold perspectives! That patented "Azuma" creativity bringing about designs far exceeding a client's imagination that make him an object of admiration and a goal to architects... A designer among designers!」


Natsuki
「You seem... kinda obsessed. Anyway, I at least get that you're crazy about him.」


％Ｂ
「Hmmh... I guess he's still not too well known to the general public...」
Natsuki
「Oh, that's the bus...」
％Ｂ
「What!? Hey, we're gonna run for it!」
Natsuki
「Huh? Huh?」
％Ｂ
「C'mon, hurry! Natsuki!」
Natsuki
「Yeah, yeah...」
