The clock rings to signal the end of the day.
But today, everyone stops working and starts getting ready to go home, Azuma-san included.

Azuma
「All right. Let's head out for today.」
Firm Staff A
「Sounds good.」
Firm Staff B
「Great work today.」
all
％Ｂ
「U-Uh, what? We're not working overtime today?」
Firm Staff A
「What are you talking about? Today's payday.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, that's right...」
It's an unofficial rule here at the Azuma Architectural Firm.
Azuma
「I won't be able to let you go home at a normal time when we're busy with work. Having payday be the one day every month when you can go home earlier and have a good time'll get you doing better work on the other days.」


Azuma
「What do you think? Wanna go out for some drinks with us?」
％Ｂ
「Oh... Uh...」
Firm Staff A
「Chief, you can't just ask him that.」
Azuma
「Hm?」
Firm Staff A
「He's got his own plans, obviously.」
all
Firm Staff B
「Right?」
％Ｂ
「Y-Yes... I have someone waiting for me.」
We're going to go out to eat somewhere a little nice today, since it's payday.

Azuma
「Oh, do you now? Then just go already.」
％Ｂ
「No, but I'm sure she'll be out late too, and we're just going to go eat dinner somewhere anyway...」

Azuma
「Even more reason to not make your bride wait. All right. I'm gonna call Nishioka and tell her to let Natsuki-chan go home early.」


％Ｂ
「Wha... Please don't! I get it! I'll leave right now!」

I head to the mall where I'm meeting up with Natsuki after being more or less kicked out by Azuma-san.

Natsuki
「
Ryousukeee! 
Ohh! 
Over here!」
％Ｂ
「Thanks for waiting. You got out pretty early.」
Natsuki
「Well, someone called the studio to talk to Sensei about something, and then she suddenly said I was free to go for the day.」

％Ｂ
「...」
Natsuki
「What's wrong?」
％Ｂ
「...That was probably Teacher... I think he must've contacted Nishioka-san because he found out you and I were meeting up...」


Natsuki
「Ahaha, Azuma-san sure is a character. But it's a good thing that he's being so considerate, isn't it?」


％Ｂ
「Yeah, but I feel kinda bad, since it feels like I got in the way of your studio's work.」

Natsuki
「Let's let our bosses be nice to us once a month, at least.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, I guess I'll just accept the good will.」
Either way, the two of us are meeting up here to eat out, since it's payday and all.

Natsuki
「Where do you wanna go, then? Or more like, what do you wanna eat?」
％Ｂ
「Let's see... How hungry are you?」
Natsuki
「Mmm, I kinda don't know if I'm hungry or not? I feel like I could eat if I got started.」

％Ｂ
「Hm... Then how about we go to a bar for once and drink a bit?」
Natsuki
「Mhm, that sounds good. We can just add some food onto our tab once we start getting hungry.」

％Ｂ
「That's what we'll go with, then. Okay, let's get going.」
Natsuki
「Mhm!」
Natsuki hooks her arm around my elbow.
We walk to the bar arm in arm.
Ryousuke・Natsuki
％Ｂ
「Cheers!」
Natsuki
「Cheers!」
％Ｂ・Natsuki
％Ｂ
「Cheers!」
Natsuki
「Cheers!」
％Ｂ
「Ngh, ngh, ngh... Pfaaahhh! This beer's great!」
Natsuki
「Nnh... Gulp... Gulp... Hahhh... Oolong tea's the best!」
Once we sat down at the bar, I ordered a beer and Natsuki ordered oolong tea.

％Ｂ
「Still don't like alcohol?」
Natsuki
「Mmm, it's not like I don't like it, but I get dizzy right away.」

％Ｂ
「When was the last time both of us drank again?」
Natsuki
「Wasn't it back when we submitted the marriage registration? Back when your family and mine got together to celebrate.」

％Ｂ
「Oh yeah, back then... You got totally wasted off your first beer...」


Natsuki got drunk and suddenly started talking with my parents.
She started talking about what she liked about me and went on and on and on about how much she loved me.

That ended up with my parents not really knowing what else to do but smile, and Natsuki's parents panicking.
As for me, I was just sitting there with my face red...
％Ｂ
「Gotta say, I had no idea how to respond to that love confession terrorism of yours back then.」
Natsuki
「Uuuh... I don't wanna think about what I did back then anymore...」
％Ｂ
「You don't even remember it.」
Natsuki didn't remember anything about what she had done while drunk when she woke up the next morning.

％Ｂ
「It's one thing to have low tolerance, but it's amazing that you can get that drunk off of just one beer.」

Natsuki
「I can't help it. I just have a low tolerance. And besides, it's not my fault I was drinking that night. It doesn't even taste good.」


％Ｂ
「But you're the one who said you wanted one...」
Natsuki
「I don't get how beer's supposed to taste good. I can't believe you like drinking something that bitter.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, you hear that a lot from people who don't like it. Beer's not about the flavor. It's about how it feels going down.」

Natsuki
「How it feels going down? It's not like it's soba or something. I don't think that's how you should be thinking about drinks.」

％Ｂ
「I mean, I didn't think it was good when I drank it the first time either.」

％Ｂ
「But it started tasting better to me while I was drinking with other people.」

％Ｂ
「That's when I figured it out. Beer's not about flavor. It's about how it feels going down.」

Natsuki
「You just heard that from one of your senior coworkers, didn't you?」
％Ｂ
「...Yeah, I did. But it really did start tasting better to me. That refreshing feeling when you're drinking it and the carbonation going down your throat's kinda nice.」


Natsuki
「The way it feels going down your throat, huh... Well, if you really think so, then I think I'll try a bit too.」

％Ｂ
「Uh... I don't really think that's...」
Natsuki
「Just a bit. Not a whole glass like last time. Just a sip. I won't get drunk that way.」


I dunno about that...
I kinda don't wanna see what's going to happen if she does get drunk...
Natsuki
「You're not going to stop me from actually drinking some beer after all of that advertising you did for it, are you?」

％Ｂ
「...Fine. Just one sip, all right?」
I hand her my stein that's still more than half full.
Maybe I shouldn't have said anything...
％Ｂ
「You better take just one sip, all right? No more than that.」

Natsuki
「Yeah, yeah. Let's try it, then! Ngh... Gulp... Gulp... Gulp...!」

％Ｂ
「Hey, what the...!?」
Natsuki
「Gulp... Gulp... Gulp... Pfaaahh!」
％Ｂ
「Wh-What the hell!? You said you'd have just a sip―」
Natsuki
「How am I gonna know how it feels going down with just a sip?」
Yeah, but still, I can't believe she drained all the beer that was left in the stein...

Natsuki
「Hmm... I see. I think I might kinda get what you were talking about with how it feels going down.」


％Ｂ
「A...Are you okay...?」
Natsuki
「Hm? What do you mean?」
％Ｂ
「What do I...? I meant, uh... How do you feel?」
Natsuki
「Well, I don't feel anything right now. The world hasn't suddenly started spinning around me like last time or anything.」


％Ｂ
「O-Oh, really...」
Natsuki
「Maybe I got that drunk last time 'cause of some other reason. We were pretty busy around then with renting the house and getting ready to move in and stuff.」


％Ｂ
「Yeah, things were pretty all over the place.」
Natsuki
「I might've gotten drunk quicker because I was a little tired. Maybe I actually have a high tolerance.」

％Ｂ
「Well, that'd be a relief for me.」
Natsuki
「By the way.」
％Ｂ
「Hm? What?」
Natsuki
「Why are there three of you?


」
％Ｂ
「...Uh.」
Natsuki
「Oh, and now there's a fourth one. Now what do I dooo? Which 

Ryousuke 
one of you 
am I supposed to kiiiss?」
％Ｂ
「Kiss...? Uh, wait... Natsuki-san?」
Natsuki
「Uuuuhh～... 
Ryousukeeeeee
Attentioooon
!」
％Ｂ
「Y-Yes!?」
Natsuki
「Why are you so cooool～? ...You're always, always thinking for my saaake～ ...You're so niiice～, and perverteeed, and dependable～ and perverted!」


％Ｂ
「Uh... Are those all compliments?」
Natsuki
「But our baby's definitely going to end up being a boy because you're always so mean to me～」

Natsuki
「Nnnh～ I'm so happy I got to marry yooou～ You're always nearby

, Ryousuke

～ When I go to sleep at night, and when I wake up in the mornings～ Eheheeeh... I'm sooo happy～」

Aahhhh! It's the confession terrorism!
The other customers are smirking at us.
Natsuki
「I think about you all the tiiime～ Even when I'm at wooork～ I always have to stop myself from sending you messages～ ...Are my love waves reaching you? Are you picking up all my lovey-doveeey～?」


％Ｂ
「Uh, um, Natsuki?」
Natsuki
「What is iiit, darling?」
％Ｂ
「D-Darling!?」
She's never called me that before...
％Ｂ
「You're drunk. I'm gonna get you some water.」
Natsuki
「Hehehe, of course I'm nooot～ Excuse meee, another draft beer, pleeease!」

Agh, this isn't good. She's completely drunk already.
all
Natsuki
「I'm hooooome～!」
％Ｂ
「Y-You idiot! Shhhh!」
Natsuki
「Ahaha, shhh～♪」
I've somehow managed to get home carrying the drunk Natsuki.
％Ｂ
「Uhh... Here's the light switch.」
Natsuki
「Nnhh～ ...It's briiight～ Where's thiiis～?」
％Ｂ
「What are you talking about? We're home. You literally just said it.」

Natsuki
「Oh, right～ We're home already～」
％Ｂ
「Here, can you take your shoes off yourself?」
Natsuki
「Nnh～ I caaan't～ Take them off for me～」
％Ｂ
「Ugh... Here, raise your feet.」
Natsuki
「Nooo～ You perv～ You're just trying to get me to do that so you can see my panties, right～?」

％Ｂ
「You're the one who told me to take your shoes off for you.」
Natsuki
「You don't wanna take off my shoes, you wanna take off my panties～ Peeerv～ You're so dirtyyy～ You freeeak～」

％Ｂ
「Oh, come on...」
Natsuki
「But dooon't～ worryyy～ I still love you sooo～ 
much, Ryousukeee～ 
muuuuuch～ 
Ehehe... Mmmh～ Chu, chuuu～ Mmhehe～」

Natsuki
「Nnh～ ...Nnh～? Oh dear... Oh dear oh dear oh dear...」
％Ｂ
「Wha... Watch out!?」
I try to support Natsuki as she suddenly starts to fall over.
But she leans onto me with her full body weight, and pushes me backward into the hallway.

Natsuki
「Kyaah!?」
％Ｂ
「Gueh!?」
My vision goes black for an instant from the impact.
％Ｂ
「Ow, ow... Hey, you okay? You're drunk, so you're gonna get hurt if you're not careful moving a―」

Natsuki
「...Hup.」
％Ｂ
「―round... Uh. What are you doing?」
Natsuki
「Mmm～? I'm taking my clothes off.」
％Ｂ
「...Why would that be?」
Natsuki
「I... wanna have sex now♪」
％Ｂ
「Have se... H-Here!?」
Natsuki
「Yep, here～ Our neighbors might hear if we're too loooud～ ...Hold it in, okaaay～?」


She unbuttons her shirt and pulls her bra upward to expose her boobs.


％Ｂ
「W-Wait a second... We're seriously gonna do it here?」
She strips off her pants and underwear instead of answering me.
Natsuki
「All ready to go～ Okay, let's do it～♪」
％Ｂ
「You're kidding, right!?」
