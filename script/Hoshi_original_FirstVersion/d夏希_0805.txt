The Tanabata Festival is tomorrow. The school's filled with students busying themselves with preparations.

It looks like almost the entirety of the student population's here, even though it's summer break.
％Ｂ
「But things are very quiet here compared to outside.」
Misa
「Yes, because only the naturalist and astronomy clubs are using the old school building. I am very grateful we can afford to go about our preparations in a calm fashion.」

Marika
「Okihara-san, where should I put this tank?」
Misa
「Oh, that one will be placed near the entrance. It is very heavy, so please do not overexert yourself. We can move it together afterward.」


all
Natsuki
「Two pretty girls, pouring their blood, sweat, and tears into preparing for the Tanabata Festival tomorrow. Very picturesque!」

Marika
「Geez, Segawa-san, stop teasing us and heeelp.」
Natsuki
「Sorry, but I'm a grad-alb member right now. I'll get yelled at if I don't preserve this moment as a photo.」

Marika
「Heeey, that's not faaair!」

Misa
「By the way, Natsuki-san, I heard you submitted a photo to the Tanabata Festival photography contest. What kind of photo did you take?」


Natsuki
「Huh!? How do you know about that!?」
％Ｂ
「Whoops, I told them.」
all
Natsuki
「Whaaaaaaaaaat!?」
％Ｂ
「It's not like you need to hide it, right?」
Natsuki
「And it's not like you needed to tell them either.」
Marika
「What kind of photo did you send in?」
％Ｂ
「That's the thing. She didn't even show me. She got it developed at the photography store and just submitted it right after.」

Natsuki
「Because I feel like you guys would just compliment me like crazy if I showed you. Like, "This photo's going to win for sure!" That'd just get me too hopeful.」


％Ｂ
「I won't compliment you then, so show me. You've got the negative, right?」

Natsuki
「Why do you wanna get me down before the results are even out...?」
Fair enough.
Misa
「Could you tell us the title of your submission, if possible?」
Marika
「Mhm, that'll make it easier to find when they put them up on display.」
Natsuki
「M-Mmmh... I guess that should be fine. The title's "A Bridge of Prayers."」

all
％Ｂ
「Ohh, looks like things are moving along pretty smoothly for you guys.」
Touko
「Hey there, you two. There isn't really that much for you guys to do anymore at this point.」

％Ｂ
「My bad, we should've come a little earlier.」
Touko
「You look pretty beat, Camera-chan.」
Natsuki
「Wh-What are you talking about...? I'm only just getting started.」
Touko
「Wah...」
Natsuki
「Hehe... I've finally gotten a picture of you, Touko.」
Touko
「Huh? You could've taken one of me any time if you'd just asked.」

Natsuki
「...Why didn't you tell me that sooner...?」
all
Ousaka's reaching up as high as she can with her small body to try to put a panel up on the wall.

Sora
「Nh... Nnnhh... Nnnhhh...」
What the heck is this cute, fluffy thing... It's kinda cute...
％Ｂ
「Ousaka. Want me to do it?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「Oh, this is one of the panels with Natsuki's photos on it. Leave it to me.」
all
I take the panel from Ousaka and hang it on the wall.
％Ｂ
「Here fine?」
Sora
「...The right side's a little too high.」
％Ｂ
「How about this?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「Huh... So the locations of the panels correspond with the constellations' locations in the sky? That's pretty nice.」

Sora
「...Hmhmh.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, and the Big Dipper's right above us!」
Sora
「...Tou's idea.」
％Ｂ
「Pretty good, Yukimura. I like how it'll probably be fun for the guests to notice it at all.」

Touko
「Hmhmh!」
％Ｂ
「Oh... Right, you showed us those weird mythological stories a few days ago. Are you really going to put them on display?」

Touko
「Oh... Yeah, about that. Fluffyhead didn't really want to change the stories themselves, so this is what we did.」

％Ｂ
「Okay, let's see here... "─The goddess Aphrodite"...」
all
"Aphrodite was one of the twelve Olympian gods, and was known as the goddess of love, beauty, and s×xuality."

"Aphrodite was also known as the goddess of passion, and she gave birth to many children from different fathers even after she married Hephaestus, god of the forge. She loved having s×x."


Natsuki
「It's been censored...」
"Though Aphrodite is known as having been born from foam, this foam was actually created when the titan Cronus killed his father Uranus and threw his g×nitals into the sea. The foam came forth from these g×nitals."
"And so, Aphrodite's father is a p×nis."
％Ｂ
「And it's only one letter at a time...」
"Hephaestus became angry with his wife's rampant affairs, and fashioned a special net and hid it in the bed. After Hephaestus left for his work, Aphrodite naturally invited the war god Ares to her home."


"As soon as the two of them began having ×ex on her bed, Hephaestus' net trapped them both. Having caught the adulterers in the act, Hephaestus showed them to the messenger god Hermes, who had just happened to come by."
％Ｂ
「...You can really tell she didn't wanna censor it from how the censoring's in a different place the second time "sex" comes up...」

％Ｂ
「This is... just barely okay... No, it's not... Hmm... Okay but not-okay...?」
Sora
「...Tou's idea.」

Touko
「Wha... Huh? It-It wasn't, though? It wasn't me, it was Fluffyhead―」

Natsuki
「Touko's acting all flustered for once... I gotta capture this moment!」
％Ｂ
「Yukimura... I think this really only made things more obscene...」

Touko
「S-Stop it... It really wasn't me! I'm telling you, it was Fluffyhead! It was, right?」


Sora
「...」
Touko
「Why aren't you saying anything!?」
％Ｂ
「You guys sure turned out to be a good team...」
all
％Ｂ
「Oh... Hear that...?」
Natsuki
「Sounds like Rikka's playing piano.」
％Ｂ
「She came to school just to play?」
Natsuki
「Let's go take a look.」
Natsuki
「I'll be taking that springtime of youth of yours!」

Rikka
「Wh-What? Segawa-san?」
％Ｂ
「Yo.」
Rikka
「...You too
, Hino-kun

? You're here already?」
Natsuki
「Huh? What are you talking about?」
Rikka
「I just finished recording the background music that the event committee asked for. I thought you came here for that.」

％Ｂ
「Uh, I have no idea what you're talking about...? Wait, the event committee asked for that?」
Rikka
「Nirasawa-kun told me he wanted background music for the old school building to liven it up, because it isn't connected to the school's broadcasting system.」

Rikka
「I wasn't actually planning on helping, but I couldn't just ignore the request after I heard that it was the naturalist and astronomy clubs using that building.」


Natsuki
「...」
Rikka
「Kyah!? W-Wait, Segawa-san! What are you doing!?」
Natsuki
「Aww, Rikkaaa, you're just never honest, are yooou? You should've just told us you were helping out!」

Natsuki
「We could've done lots more stuff together that way!」
Rikka
「That wouldn't happen.」
Natsuki
「Why not!?」
Rikka
「Because I have enough tact to know not to barge into your world.」
％Ｂ
「Wh-What do you mean, our world? We were just doing event committee work, right?」

Natsuki
「M-Mhm, mhm! That's right. We were very serious.」
Rikka
「Sure, we can go with that.」
Natsuki
「Anyway, that's all in the past now... but I'm glad now that you've joined us too, Rikka.」


Rikka
「Wh-Why do you have to take pictures!?」
Natsuki
「I'm making up for all the ones I haven't taken until now.」
Rikka
「
Hino-kun
Hey
! Stop your girlfriend!」
％Ｂ
「Natsuki, you should step back a little and get a few shots that include the piano.」

Natsuki
「Roger that! Great idea
, Ryousuke

!」
％Ｂ
「Nah, you would've come up with the same thing soon enough.」
Rikka
「I...Idiot couple! You two are such an idiot couple!」
all
Shuuichi
「Ladies and gentlemen. We have been able to finish all preparations for tomorrow's Tanabata Festival, thanks to your fervor. Good work, all of you!」


Shuuichi
「But it's still too soon to rest easy! Tomorrow is showtime! Only after safely overcoming the Tanabata Festival tomorrow does our summer break truly begin!」


Shuuichi
「A trip is a trip until you get home! An event is an event until the cleanup ends! I'm counting on all of you for tomorrow!」



Event Committee Members A B C & Marika
「Yessir!」
all
Natsuki
「You guys sure are energetic, aren't you?」
all
Shuuichi
「Oh, and one more thing. This year, we managed to get the naturalist and astronomy clubs to take back their nonparticipation and agree to take part in the festival.」


Shuuichi
「The work done by our new committee members, Hino Ryousuke and Shinozaki Marika, was instrumental in getting them to participate. I want to give them a round of applause.」


Shuuichi
「The work done by our two new committee members was instrumental in getting them to participate. I want to give them a round of applause.」


all
％Ｂ
「Huh? Us?」
Marika
「We didn't really...」
％Ｂ
「Agh, uh, th-thank you very much.」
Marika
「Wawah... This is really embarrassing...」
Shuuichi
「The presidents of both clubs say they want to say their thanks as well. Please, come on in.」

all
Misa
「Please excuse me.」
Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「Senpai... Ousaka...」
Misa
「We of the naturalist and astronomy clubs would like to express our sincere gratitude to the members of the event organization committee for their tireless efforts after our decisions to participate in the festival.」


Natsuki
「Wow, Misa-san... She's as formal as ever...」
Misa
「It is all thanks to the members of this committee that both of our clubs will be able to participate in our school's Tanabata Festival without incident. We have come here to thank you for your service.」


Sora
「...Thank you very much...」
Misa
「And in particular... 
To Hino Ryousuke-san, and Shinozaki Marika-san
To the two of you standing there
.」
％Ｂ
「Wha...?」
Marika
「Y-You mean... us?」
Misa
「We were able to decide to participate only because of your refusal to give up on persuading us to do so. Thank you very much.」


％Ｂ
「Haha... That kinda makes me blush...」
Marika
「Y-Yeah...」
Misa
「And also... Segawa Natsuki-san.」
Natsuki
「Mmm... Fueh? M-Me...?」
Misa
「Your photos have provided beautiful color to our displays. Thank you very much once more for your wonderful photography.」


Sora
「...Mh.」
Ousaka gives us a thumbs-up.
Just like always.
all
Natsuki
「Well, uh... I-I mean... I just took the photos you asked me to... You don't really need to thank me...」

Natsuki
「A-And besides, I don't think I would've helped out as much as I did if 
Ryousuke 
this guy 
wasn't in the event committee... So I guess that means, if he weren't here... I'd be...」


％Ｂ
「They asked you to take photos for them 'cause your photos have the ability to draw people in, right?」

％Ｂ
「That's your own ability. I think you can be prouder.」
Natsuki
「B-But... I don't think I would've been able to take photos like that without you...」

Natsuki
「No, I'm sure. I know I wouldn't have been able to take those photos without you
, Ryousuke

.」

Natsuki
「I was able to feel safe diving for the underwater photos because you were watching out for me... You were worried about my body the whole time.」




Natsuki
「And I was only able to get the star photos because you did lots of research, and you stayed with me all night so I wouldn't have to be scared...」


Natsuki
「So... Misa-san, Sora, if you're going to thank anyone, you should thank 
Ryousuke
him
.」
％Ｂ
「Now wait just a second. It's your photos they were impressed by. I didn't do much.」

Natsuki
「No, you didn't. You encouraged me lots when I couldn't get good photos... I'm really grateful to you myself

,\nRyousuke

.」
％Ｂ
「I'm your assistant. Of course I'd encourage and help you.」
Natsuki
「It might've been only natural for you, but it made me really happy.」
％Ｂ
「I-I was happy to get to help you too, Natsuki...」
Natsuki
「
Ryousuke
Ehehe
...」
％Ｂ
「Natsuki...」
Shuuichi
「All right, dismissed! Good work, everyone!」
all
％Ｂ
「U-Uh?」
Shuuichi
「No need to have to deal with this idiot couple for any longer. Go home early and rest up for tomorrow.」

all
Event Committee Member A
「Great work today!」
Event Committee Member B
「Let's all do our best tomorrow.」
％Ｂ
「Uhh... Were we being an idiot couple just now...?」
Misa
「Yes. Very much so.」
Sora
「...Idiot couple.」
Marika
「Thank you very much for the meal.」
all
Natsuki
「Auuuh...」
I guess we've gone and done something pretty carefree, despite the fact that it's the day before the festival.
