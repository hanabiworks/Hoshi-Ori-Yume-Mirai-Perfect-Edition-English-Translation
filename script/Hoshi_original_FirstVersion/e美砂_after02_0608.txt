「...Uuhhh...?」
I feel like I had a weird dream.
I remember having a dream in general, but I don't remember any details.
I feel like I was in a really relaxing place...
％Ｂ
「Nnh... fuaah...」
I wake up to a pleasant smell.
Misa
「Good morning! The weather is excellent today!」

％Ｂ
「Wha, uh... G-Good morning!」
Misa smiles at me.
I think for a second that I'm at work.
I get up out of bed and give a formal greeting on reflex.
Misa
「Ufufu, what are you being so formal for? Are you still half asleep?」

％Ｂ
「Oh, well, ahahaha... It's 'cause you're so neat and tidy, I just...」


Unlike me with my messy bed hair...
Misa's got her hair done up properly, and she's got makeup on too.
She looks like she's about to go to work.
％Ｂ
「And... why are you in a lab coat?」
Misa
「Th-This is because... I didn't have anything to wear... My suit would be a bit too formal, but pajamas or just underwear would be...」


％Ｂ
「Oh, right... Yeah, 'cause you were cooking.」
Misa
「Y-Yes, exactly.」
％Ｂ
「Uh... I'm sorry for looking like this... Maybe I should at least go shave or something.」

Misa
「It's okay. This is your home, so please feel free to relax.」

Misa
「I just, umm... I wanted you to see me as pretty as I could be in the morning.」

Misa
「My makeup came out very nicely thanks to your skin care from yesterday. I'm perfectly prepared to see you.」


％Ｂ
「Really... I'm glad you feel that way.」

Misa
「But I'm not that prim and proper, just so you know. I'm only wearing a shirt under this lab coat...」

％Ｂ
「Oh, really...?」
Now that she mentions it, I can spot some alluring curves through her lab coat.\n\r

My memories of last night with her come back to mind...
％Ｂ
「Gulp...」
Misa
「No more right now, since we did it lots yesterday.」
％Ｂ
「!?」
Misa
「Ufufufu...」
She's got me figured out...
Misa
「If we do things like that in the morning... I won't be able to stand up straight all day.」

％Ｂ
「Y-Yeah... You're right.」
Misa
「And so... let us eat breakfast!」
％Ｂ
「Wow, you've already made it?」
Misa
「I took the liberty of using the foodstuffs in your fridge. Now then, please wait as I prepare everything.」

Misa
「Oh, but before that... I'll pour some black tea, so please enjoy a cup for the morning♪」

％Ｂ
「Ohhh...」
An elegant fragrance spreads from the tea she pours me.

％Ｂ
「...I don't remember having any black tea here.」
Misa
「Actually, I prepared this myself. This!」

She pulls out a small can.
There's an incredibly girly-looking label on it. Even the packaging looks delicious.

Misa
「I found it at a store, and it has a very nice fragrance. I thought I would love for you to taste it...」

％Ｂ
「Huh... Yeah, it looks pretty legitimate.」
Misa
「Ufufu... I may have forgotten my underwear, but I did not forget this.」
Misa
「Now then, I'll go prepare breakfast!」
all
She runs off to the kitchen, her lab coat fluttering in her wake.
I can't help but smile when I watch her dance around in the kitchen. It's like she's conducting an experiment.

Misa
「Thank you for waiting!」
％Ｂ
「Ooohh!」
Misa
「Today's breakfast is lightly grilled bacon, boiled sausage... and a fluffy omelette!」


％Ｂ
「W-Wow! It's like a hotel restaurant...」
Misa
「It isn't that impressive. And I got some grill marks on the omelette...」

Misa
「But I know for sure I've packed plenty of love into it. Please enjoy this with toast!」

％Ｂ
「Let's eat!」
Misa
「Yes, enjoy... Oh, but before that...」

％Ｂ
「Hm?」
Misa
「I forgot the finishing touch! This!」
She pulls out a bottle of ketchup with a flourish.
％Ｂ
「Yeah, you gotta draw on the omelette with ketchup.」
Misa
「Indeed, an omelette is rather barren without a ketchup drawing on it.」

Misa
「Do you have any requests for a drawing?」
％Ｂ
「I want you to draw your favorite thing, then.」
Misa
「My favorite thing... I see, I see. Then...」

She skillfully manipulates the ketchup bottle and draws on the yellow canvas.

％Ｂ
「Hmm...」
I wonder what kinda fish this is.
Two eyes, a pretty big mouth, and hair...
％Ｂ
「...What's this fish called?」
Misa
「What? ...It isn't a fish. It's my favorite thing... It's Ryousuke-san!」

Misa
「What? ...It isn't a fish. It's my favorite thing... It's you!」

％Ｂ
「Wha... I-Is it... really?」
Misa
「Isn't that what you asked for? My favorite thing...」

％Ｂ
「Y-Yeah... I did. I dunno what to say. Thanks...」

I can't help but be embarrassed.
I was so sure that she'd draw a fish.
I see...
So I'm just that big of a deal to Misa.

That... makes me pretty happy.
Misa
「Could you draw something on my omelette?」
％Ｂ
「All right. I'll draw my favorite thing, then.」
Misa
「I wonder what that could be... I'm very excited!」
She waits, her eyes glittering in anticipation.
I grab the ketchup and carefully draw Misa's face.
It's pretty difficult, but it ended up looking like her... I think.
Misa
「Wow～ It's a very pretty woman～ I wonder what she's like～」

％Ｂ
「A bright and fun person who's really pretty, and loves the ocean and fish... I guess?」
Misa
「How wonderful!」
％Ｂ
「All right... Let's eat!」
Misa
「Yes, I will also eat!」
We clap our hands together and start eating.
Misa
「Aaahhh, it's such a waste to eat such a wonderful omelette...」

Misa
「But it looks delicious... Hamhamh... Aahh～ ...It's so fluffy～」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, it is... This tastes amazing.」

Misa
「The trick is to mix the eggs veeery well before cooking them.」
Misa
「It reminded me of back when I was a university student, because it was like doing an experiment.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, you and experiments go well together. You'd look pretty professor-like if you had glasses on too.」

Misa
「But, my eyesight won't even get the slightest bit worse. Perhaps it's because I'm always looking at the ocean...」

all
We laugh and continue breakfast.
Misa does the dishes again after we eat.
I pull out my sketchbook while I wait, and try drawing out a sketch of the "sea of jellies" that Misa's envisioning.

％Ｂ
「Hmm...」
It... didn't really come out that great...
Misa
「What are you drawing?」
She peers in from behind after finishing the dishes.
％Ｂ
「Some concept art for the "sea of jellies." What do you think?」
Misa
「...Well... How do I say this... I feel it may be slightly bland like this.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah...」
It may be a small hallway, but there's still a lot of space.
The display just ends up getting kinda stale.
％Ｂ
「How about we try putting chairs in the middle of the hall, then?」
Misa
「...Chairs?」
％Ｂ
「You know, 'cause you're always standing at aquariums. And even if they do have chairs, they're usually away from the actual displays...」


％Ｂ
「I think it'd be pretty cool if there were chairs in front of the displays, so you can watch the tanks while sitting...」

I draw some simple chairs into the sketch.
％Ｂ
「And you walk pretty far to get to the big tanks from the entrance, so you can take a break here and watch the jellyfish... So you can kinda prepare yourself for the rest of the stuff.」


Misa
「I think sitting while watching the jellyfish is a very good idea. I feel it would be resting for both body and soul... but...」


％Ｂ
「Something on your mind?」
Misa
「I don't think you would be able to see the tanks while sitting in the center. People would be walking throughout this area... and there would be quite the distance between the chairs and the tanks.」


％Ｂ
「You're right... Then what if we just put the chairs in front of the tanks?」

％Ｂ
「Oh, but then that means the people walking by won't be able to get closer... And the guests would feel rushed to get out of the chairs if there's a lot of people...」


Misa
「It's supposed to be a soothing place, so I would like for it to be comfortable for anyone and everyone.」

％Ｂ
「But... If it's gonna be relaxing, then chairs would be nice, right...」

Misa
「Yes. I think it's a wonderful idea, but...」
all
I draw a few more rough sketches.
I change the positions of the chairs, the placement of the tanks...
But nothing really seems to work.
％Ｂ
「Hmm... This is pretty hard.」
Misa
「Yes, it is...」
This is looking like it's going to take more time than we thought.
I'd like to get a concrete idea together before the day of Misa's presentation... but we'll have to think about this...
