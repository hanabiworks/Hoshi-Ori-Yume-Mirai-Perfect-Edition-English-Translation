「...Zzz... Zzz...」
％Ｂ
「...Nh... Aahh...」
...What? A phone call...?
％Ｂ
「...」
I open my eyes. I'm lying on the floor at the office for some reason.
There's bright morning sunlight shining through the windows.
I look around. Azuma-san's sleeping on the couch.
One of my coworkers is sleeping on three chairs arranged in a row.
％Ｂ
「Oh... right... I stayed at the office last night for the last-minute crunch for the model and fell asleep...」

％Ｂ
「Uh... Where's my phone?」
I look for my phone. I find it on my desk, buried under a pile of paperwork.
％Ｂ
「...It's from Misa.」
【Misa】「Good morning. I stayed #Nthe night at the lab #Nonce again. I just woke #Nup.」
【Misa】「How are you doing? You #Nsaid you were busy too. #NHave you finished the #Nmodel you mentioned #Nbefore?」
％Ｂ
「...Misa stayed the night at work too... I told her to go home when she could, too...」

But I guess I can't blame her...
She's even worse than me when it comes to forgetting about everything else once she gets absorbed in her work.
【％Ｂ】「Morning. I worked #Novernight too, to #Nfinish the model. Your #Nmessage woke me up.」
【Misa】「I woke you up? I #Napologize.」
【％Ｂ】「No, it's fine. I #Nmanaged to finish the #Nmodel, by the way.」
I take a look at the model.
It's shining in the morning light, fully complete.

【％Ｂ】「It's the best one I've #Nmade so far. If I do #Nsay so myself...」
【Misa】「That's very good! #NCongratulations!」
【％Ｂ】「Save those words for #Nwhen we get through the #Ncompetition. There's no #Npoint in finishing the #Nmodel if we don't win.」
【％Ｂ】「But I'm confident we'll #Nwin.」
【Misa】「I understand. Let's #Ncelebrate when you do! #NI'll contact you again.」
【％Ｂ】「Got it. Talk to you #Nlater!」
【Misa】「Yes! I can't wait!」
【Misa】_st_0217
％Ｂ
「Phew... Fuaaahhh... Afhhh...」
I put my phone down and take another good look at the model.
％Ｂ
「...It really did come out great.」
I can't not be proud of myself.
This model looks just that good.
It's genuinely the best one I've made in my life.
％Ｂ
「And I've been working nonstop for a while now too.」
I've been working day and night with no breaks to create this magnum opus of mine.

I know I told Misa to save her congratulations, but I think I should at least take the time to congratulate myself on a job well done for now.

％Ｂ
「...」
It's been three years since I graduated university as an architecture major and started working here at the Azuma Architectural Firm.\n\r
To be honest, I haven't done much for the firm during those three years.
I passed my architect exams... but I haven't had any projects to call my own.\n\r

But I feel like I might've gotten a feel for something this time around.
％Ｂ
「...I guess this means I'm finally half qualified now, then.」
That's probably what Azuma-san would say.
There are still tons of things I have to do and have to become able to do in order to be called fully qualified.

But I swear I'll do work like that one day and get the approval of Azuma-san and my coworkers.\n\r

And when that time comes, Misa and I'll―
Azuma
「Fuaaaaaahhh... Hey... Morning.」

％Ｂ
「Good morning. Should I brew some coffee?」
Azuma
「Please.」
all
I make coffee for Azuma-san and myself.
I'll let my senior coworker keep sleeping.
％Ｂ
「Here you go.」
Azuma
「Mm, thanks. Slurp... Hahhh... Tastes good after a night of work...」

％Ｂ
「Yes, it does... Fhh, fhh... Gulp.」
Azuma
「...Still, this really came out nicely.」
％Ｂ
「Thank you very much. Hearing you say that makes all the hard work worth it.」

Azuma
「But don't get a big head now. I'd say you're finally about half qualified now. You're not an architect until you've built something yourself.」


％Ｂ
「Yes. I understand.」
I smile internally.
I knew he'd say that.
Azuma
「But that aside, good work. Today's Sunday. You can go home. Go rest up in your own bed.」


％Ｂ
「I'll be taking my leave, then. But I actually have a little something to do, so I won't be going home...」


Azuma
「You're a busy man... Well, do what you like. I bet you'll have some paid time off piled up after all this, so go use that up once you've got time to relax.」

％Ｂ
「Yes, I will.」
％Ｂ
「I need to eat some breakfast and wash up...」
I can eat breakfast anywhere, but washing up's gonna be difficult.
There won't be any bathhouses open this early, so I guess I'll have to take a shower at a manga cafe or something...

％Ｂ
「...Hm?」
I check to see who it's from.
It's Misa.

％Ｂ
「Hello?」
Misa
『Good morning. Can you speak right now?』
％Ｂ
「Yeah, it's fine. I just left work. I was told I could take the rest of the day off, so I'm gonna eat some breakfast and then head over to your classroom afterward.」


Misa
『But you only just got done with work, didn't you? You should rest at home today, so you don't overexert yourself.』

％Ｂ
「No, I'll come. I've been there every time so far, so it's just a given for me at this point.」


Misa
『I'm very happy to hear you say that, but...』
％Ｂ
「Don't worry. Besides, you only just got out of work too, right?」
％Ｂ
「And more than anything, I wanna see you.」

Misa
『Ufufu... I understand. I will accede to your wishes then, and will be awaiting you at the classroom.』


％Ｂ
「See you there, then.」
_smh_st_04
％Ｂ
「Now then... Let's get some breakfast.」
Misa
「Hello, everyone!」
Children
「Good morniiing!」
Misa
「Welcome to the "ocean wildlife classroom." Let's all learn together about ocean wildlife today!」


Children
「Okaaay!」
I'm at one end of the marketplace.
Misa puts on a "ocean wildlife classroom" here once a month with her juniors from Shionagi First Academy's naturalist club.

They bring fish tanks and teach kids about ecology and do experiments to have them learn about the ocean and other parts of nature...

It's a volunteer classroom created by her.
all
It all started with the "sea full of stars" we made back when we were in high school.

Misa taught this several times after the Tanabata Festival at school for the students who got interested after seeing the "sea full of stars."

Misa taught the kids about the wonders of the sea and fish with all her passion. Rumors spread, and eventually there were a considerable number of kids participating.


And Misa's passion for teaching didn't go away after she started university either.
She still teaches this classroom occasionally even now.\n\r
She gets a huge number of participants once summer break starts up.
I do what I can to help her out too.
I go catch fish with her on my days off... and I help out at the actual classroom too.

Misa
「Today, I will be showing all of you the hermit crab. Have any of you seen one of these before?」

Boy
「I have! It's a herman crab!」
Misa
「Very close～ Not herman, but hermit crab. They're called that because they like to live alone in borrowed shells.」


There's always a theme for each class, where she shows them the actual living creature and describes it.

Misa
「And as you may know, hermit crabs live in shells. Hermit crabs generally choose spiral shells as their homes, and wear them on their backs.」


Misa
「They do not wear the same shell for their entire lives. Your clothes become tight on you when you all get bigger, don't they?」


Misa
「It is the same for hermit crabs. Their shells become too cramped when they grow. And so they move to a larger shell when that happens.」


Misa
「And so the hermit crab moves from home to home as it grows.」

The kids are completely focused on Misa's words.
And it's not just the kids. Their parents and chaperones are all appreciating her lecture too.

％Ｂ
「I guess she really is a natural at teaching.」
Though I've known that since we were in high school, come to think of it.
all
Female Assembly Member
「This is always so popular.」
A woman approaches me.
％Ｂ
「Hello, Arita-san.」
It's Arita-san, the municipal legislative assembly member that Teacher introduced me to way back during the Tanabata Festival.

She's a local celebrity who's on her third term on the assembly.
Female Assembly Member
「There are just so many people here. You might have to use Shionagi Hall eventually if you get any more people coming.」


％Ｂ
「It'd really end up looking like a university seminar in that case.」
Female Assembly Member
「But you know, that really might not be too unbelievable. Her classroom actually came up as a topic in a meeting the other day... It's really well received right now.」


％Ｂ
「Did it really?」
Female Assembly Member
「This classroom made the local papers before, didn't it?」
％Ｂ
「Yes, it did.」
A local newspaper came by the other day to interview Misa.

Female Assembly Member
「And with this many people, it's becoming a part of the local culture.」
Female Assembly Member
「The ocean's a big part of what makes Shionagi City so attractive. We want both tourists and local residents to know how great the ocean is.」


Female Assembly Member
「So this classroom of hers is perfect for that. It might still be relatively small, but this kind of hard work is very important at the moment, without Marinpia Shionagi.」

Female Assembly Member
「I still remember what she told me back then. She wants as many people as possible to know how wonderful Shionagi's sea is.」


％Ｂ
「Yes... Misa genuinely thinks so. She's been continuing these classrooms all this time, having faith that her hard work will bear fruit.」


And I have faith in Misa too.
That's why I've come to every single one, to do what I can to support her.

Female Assembly Member
「...That hard work of hers might bear fruit faster than she expects.」

％Ｂ
「Wha...?」
She smiles mysteriously.
What does she mean by that?
Misa
「Let's take a short break here. If anyone would like to go to the bathroom, now would be the time. There will be a very interesting hermit crab making an appearance after the break.」


Looks like the classroom's just about halfway done.
all
Female Assembly Member
「I'm going to go talk to her a bit.」
％Ｂ
「Oh... Okay.」
Arita-san approaches Misa and strikes up a conversation with her.
She's whispering something into her ear.
Misa looks surprised, but also excited.
all
％Ｂ
「...I wonder what they're talking about.」
I'm curious...
My guess is that, judging from what Arita-san was just talking about, this classroom might start getting funded by the city.

％Ｂ
「It'd be great if that happened...」
Everyone involved in this classroom, especially Misa, is a volunteer.
There's a limit to what you can accomplish with volunteer activity.\n It definitely wouldn't be a bad thing to have a budget.

％Ｂ
「Oh... Looks like they're done?」
Arita-san steps away from Misa, bows to me once too, and leaves.

Misa grabs her hat and walks over to me.
％Ｂ
「Great work.」
Misa
「Yes, you too. Phew... Today's a bit hot, isn't it?」

％Ｂ
「Here's a towel.」
Misa
「Thank you very much.」
She wipes away her sweat.
％Ｂ
「What were you talking about with Arita-san just now?」
Misa
「Hmm... It's a secret.」
Misa
「It is a matter between women. I'll tell you once the right time comes.」

％Ｂ
「All right. I'll be waiting, then.」
Misa
「Yes, I apologize.」
I'm sure she'll tell me eventually.
Misa
「More importantly, thank you so very much for coming today. Are you feeling okay?」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, I did get a little sleep last night after all. I had breakfast and took a shower too, so I'm in tip-top shape.」

％Ｂ
「What about you, are you sure you're okay? You stayed at the lab overnight, right?」

Misa
「Well... To tell the truth, I'm completely exhausted from a lack of sleep and this heat.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, come on. You're the one overexerting yourself, then.」
Misa
「But I cannot afford to be absent for this classroom. The children always look forward to it... Watching the wonder in their eyes gives me strength.」


Misa
「It makes me want to communicate how wonderful the ocean is all the more.」

％Ｂ
「You're just amazing, Misa. But don't overdo it, all right?」

Misa
「I'm completely fine. I'll simply have to vent to my boyfriend when the going truly gets tough.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, anytime.」
Misa
「And I should be finished with my current research project soon, so I think I will be able to take time to relax again.」

％Ｂ
「I think once we submit our stuff to the competition and finish the presentation, I won't have much else to do either other than wait for the results.」

Misa
「It would be nice if we could relax somewhere together for the first time in a long time.」

％Ｂ
「Oh, that sounds good. It's almost your birthday too... How about we go somewhere to celebrate that?」


Misa
「Really!? That sounds wonderful!」
％Ｂ
「Where do you want to go? If there's anywhere in particular...」
Misa
「To the Republic of Andaman to see the ghost lampfish―」
％Ｂ
「No.」
Misa
「Auuuh... We really can't...?」
％Ｂ
「We can't.」
Misa
「Okay... I'm sorry...」
％Ｂ
「If there's anywhere else you wanna go. Like maybe a hot springs or―」

Misa
「Oh, then! A new species of cave crab was discovered in Okinawa a short time ago! I would love to go see it!」


...That's got nothing to do with hot springs.
Though I expected as much from Misa.
％Ｂ
「Okinawa... That might be pretty nice around this time of year. Teacher told me to go use the paid leave I haven't been using these past few days too... Let's just go!」


Misa
「Wah～! I'm so happy～! Let's go! We must go!」

She's bouncing up and down, her exhaustion forgotten.
She always pursues the things she likes, with all her heart... That part of her hasn't changed since high school.

all
It's just like her...
Misa
「I'm exhausted～」
％Ｂ
「Y-You all right?」
Misa
「A-Ahahaha... I was overflowing with energy while teaching the "ocean wildlife classroom"... but I started feeling tired all at once after it ended...」


This also hasn't changed.
She apparently doesn't feel fatigue at all when she's focused...\n\r
But all of her energy whooshes out of her once she reaches a stopping point.
It's probably that she runs out of adrenaline or something.
％Ｂ
「You should rest at my place. It's close from here anyway.」

Misa
「What? ...Would that be okay?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. I cleaned up the other night 'cause I figured this would happen.」
Misa
「Wah～ ...Even though you were so busy... A kind boyfriend is a wonderful thing to have...」

％Ｂ
「Wanna get going, then?」
Misa
「Well then, I will have to intrude upon your hospitality.」
％Ｂ
「Here, then.」
I extend my hand.
Misa
「Yes!」
She happily jumps forward and grabs my hand tightly.

％Ｂ
「Here, I made some iced coffee.」
I hold out a glass of coffee filled with ice cubes toward her.
Iced coffee can't be beat when it's hot out.
Misa
「It's delicious～! Gulp, gulp... Ahhh, I feel alive again... Pfaahh...」


％Ｂ
「Huh? You drank it all already?」
Misa
「Y-Yes, embarrassingly enough...」
％Ｂ
「Come on, it's not like it's beer.」
Misa
「A...Another, please!」
％Ｂ
「Yes, yes.」
all
She raises her glass, as if she were asking for another round at a bar.
I add some more ice and pour her another iced coffee.
Misa
「Hauh... It's very cool...」
She's drinking it slower this time, using a straw.
％Ｂ
「Looks like the air conditioning's working. Want me to bring it down a little more?」

Misa
「No, this is perfect. It's very comfortable. Your house is absolutely wonderful, Ryousuke-san...」

Misa
「No, this is perfect. It's very comfortable. Your house is absolutely wonderful...」

％Ｂ
「Well, it's not that impressive...」
It's a totally ordinary one-room apartment near the city center. The only real standout thing about it is that it's relatively new.

Misa
「But it's convenient for commuting to work too, isn't it?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, it's just one bus ride... Though I feel like that just leads to more overtime work.」

Misa
「Ufufufu... You work very hard.」
Misa
「My parents' home is far from the city center... It's very inconvenient that the last bus is so early. I've been having to sleep in our lab's nap room because of it...」


％Ｂ
「Being a university researcher sounds rough.」
Misa
「I've gotten used to it. But... I do occasionally miss sleeping in a proper bed.」

Misa
「Like my bed... or yours.」
Misa
「Like my bed... or yours.」
％Ｂ
「It's kinda cramped in this bed, isn't it?」
Misa
「No, it's very comfortable to sleep in that way. I have the most wonderful dreams.」

％Ｂ
「D-Do you now?」
Misa
「Aaahh～ All this talk of sleeping has made me sleepy... If only the bed could be the one to approach me...」

％Ｂ
「Honestly... Here. Misa?」
Misa
「Yes? Nnnh...」
％Ｂ
「Put your arms around me. Squeeze tight.」
I bring myself closer.
She hugs me tight.
％Ｂ
「All right, here we go!」
Misa
「Kyaaaahhh!?」
I grab her by the waist and lift her up.
Misa
「I-I'm being princess-carried～」
It's the classic princess carry.
She's frantically and happily kicking her feet.
％Ｂ
「Huh? Have you lost weight?」
Misa
「Auh... Can you tell? I have. I've been living rather unhealthily as of late... My meals have all been very light.」


％Ｂ
「Now that's not good. You need to eat properly.」
Misa
「I-I know, but... I thought it may be a good opportunity to try losing some weight...」


％Ｂ
「Huh? ...Has that kinda stuff been on your mind?」
Misa
「Yes... Because I'm, well... I'm certainly not on the lean side.」

％Ｂ
「You don't need to worry about that, though. You're great 'cause you're real feminine.」

Misa
「Is... Is that so?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. You're tall... so it's natural to have a proportional weight. You've already got a great figure. I love it.」

Misa
「Wah～ ...Ufufu...」
Misa
「Um, could you spin around once?」
％Ｂ
「Like this?」
Misa
「Kyaaah! ...Ufufufu... This is very fun! I'd like it if you could do it a little more～」


％Ｂ
「All right... Here!」
Misa
「Kyaaah! Round and round～!」
％Ｂ
「But my back's about to give out. I'm gonna lay you down on the bed.」

Misa
「Noooo. I want you to do it mooore.」
％Ｂ
「Nooope.」
all
I slowly stop spinning and drop her onto my bed.\n \n\r

I lie down next to her. I'm dizzy.
Misa
「The world is spinning～」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, figures.」
Misa
「...Oh my. Just where could this soft place be?」
％Ｂ
「It's the 24,800-yen bed I bought at IKEYA.」
Misa
「Oh really now～ I was so sure it was a luxury hotel bed, because it has a very nice smell.」

％Ｂ
「Does it? I feel like I haven't washed my sheets in a while...」
Misa
「But it's very comforting. Sniff sniff, sniff sniff... Aaahhh～」

％Ｂ
「You're drooling, Misa.」
Misa
「A-Aahhh! I-I am so very sorry... It was just so comfortable I...」

％Ｂ
「Honestly... You've literally got loose lips.」
Misa
「Yes, I do... Could you wipe it?」

％Ｂ
「I'll use a tissue, then...」
I reach out toward the box of tissues at my bedside.
Misa
「Nooo... I want you to do it with a kiiiss.」
％Ｂ
「Yes, yes.」
Misa
「Mmm, chu...」
％Ｂ
「Chu, slrp... mmh...」
We press our lips together.
Her lips are cold. Maybe from the iced coffee.
I try to pass my own body heat to her lips.
Misa
「Ufufufu...」
％Ｂ
「Any other requests?」
Misa
「Well, there is one thing I find disagreeable about this bed. Your pillow is slightly too tall for me.」

Misa
「Well, there is one thing I find disagreeable about this bed. Your pillow is slightly too tall for me.」

Misa
「Now if only there were a pillow that was just the right size for me...」

％Ｂ
「Then... here. Use my arm as a pillow.」
Misa
「Wow, how wonderful! A perfect fit... I just love how it smells, too...」


％Ｂ
「Honestly... You're gonna start drooling again if you're not careful.」
Misa
「I apologize in advance～」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, yeah.」
Misa's so mature when she's working.
And she's like a kid when it's just us two.
And she's really cute in both situations.
Misa
「It's as if I'm in a land of dreams...」
％Ｂ
「We'll be able to go to a real land of dreams soon. I'm talking about our vacation plans. Let's plan some stuff out sometime.」


Misa
「Hauh... I'm very much looking forward to it.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. Let's go somewhere you'd love to go.」
Misa
「Yes, a land of dreams... the Republic of Andaman...」
％Ｂ
「Not there.」
Misa
「It's fine, I'll go to the Republic of Andaman in my dreams. Together with you, Ryousuke-san...」

Misa
「It's fine, I'll go to the Republic of Andaman in my dreams. Together with you...」

％Ｂ
「With me?」
Misa
「Yes. You see～ ...Recently, if I haven't seen you in a while, I start seeing you in my dreams.」

Misa
「Yes. You see～ ...Recently, if I haven't seen you in a while, I'll start seeing you in my dreams.」

％Ｂ
「Oh really... So what am I like in your dreams?」
Misa
「The Ryousuke-san of my dreams is very kind and cool... He's a very wonderful person.」

Misa
「The you of my dreams is very kind and cool... He's a very wonderful person.」

Misa
「But he can't hold a candle to the real you...」
％Ｂ
「...Why you cute little...」
Misa
「Ufufu...」
％Ｂ
「Misa...?」
Misa
「Zzz... Zzz...」
％Ｂ
「Mm...」
all
She suddenly stops responding.
I look to see that she's sleeping comfortably.
She's been really busy lately.
I should let her rest.
Wait. I guess the same goes for me too.
％Ｂ
「...Good night.」
I'm tired too. Let's sleep.
I hope... I can see Misa in my dreams too.
