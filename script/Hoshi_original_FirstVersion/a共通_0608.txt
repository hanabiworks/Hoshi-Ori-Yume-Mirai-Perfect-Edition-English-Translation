Natsuki
「Oh, there she is. Heeey, Marikaaa!」
Marika
「Good morning, Segawa-san.」
Misa
「Good morning to you, Marika-san!」
Sora
「...Good morning.」
Natsuki
「Huh? Where's 
Hino
he
? You guys didn't ride the bus together?」

Marika
「Huh? Wait, what～? Where'd he go?」
Sora
「...Over there.」
Misa
「He seems to be staggering a bit.」
all
％Ｂ
「Kh... He...Heavy...!」
Ten liters' worth of food and water is way too heavy!
I've got the juice I bought yesterday, and water for making curry.
My backpack and the bag in my hands are stuffed full of camping supplies.

％Ｂ
「M...My arms... are at their... limit...!」
Natsuki
「What are you doing? What's the point of getting tired before we even go camping?」
Misa
「You seem to be wobbling. Are you okay?」
％Ｂ
「Good morning... I'm okay...」
all
Sora
「...So much sweat.」
％Ｂ
「Hey... Ousaka... Looks like everyone's here.」
Marika
「Looks like we were the last ones here.」
％Ｂ
「I see...」
all
Natsuki
「Then let's get on the bus already, and move to the campground!」
％Ｂ
「Wait... There's something I need to check first.」
Natsuki
「Huh? What? Everyone's here already.」
％Ｂ
「I'm not talking about people. We need to check what we're bringing.」
％Ｂ
「I'm gonna check to see if we've forgotten something. We can still go out and get something at a store if we realize we forgot to pack something.」


Misa
「I see, I see. That would be a very good idea.」
％Ｂ
「If everyone could check to make sure that they've brought everything they were in charge of, that'd be great.」

all
We all open our bags and look through them.
Natsuki
「I'm good.」
Misa
「I also have everything.」
Sora
「...No issues.」
Marika
「I have everything I was asked to bring.」
all
％Ｂ
「I... Huh?」
The curry roux... isn't in here?
％Ｂ
「Huh, that's weird... I know I bought it yesterday...」
Marika
「What's wrong? Did you forget something?」
％Ｂ
「...I can't find the curry roux.」
Natsuki
「Now wait just one second. Curry without roux is just simmered vegetables and meat.」


％Ｂ
「No, I've got the mild roux. I can't find the medium-hot one...」

Marika
「Maybe you left it at home?」
％Ｂ
「They should've both been in the same grocery bag, though... I never took it out of the bag, so it shouldn't be at home...」

Misa
「But we do have the mild roux, yes? That should be enough to make curry, then.」

Natsuki
「Uhh, I don't really know about just mild curry.」
Sora
「...I don't hate mild.」
％Ｂ
「Well either way, I'll go buy it at that convenience store.」
all
I'm pretty sure a convenience store should stock it.
It'll be an unexpected cost, but I'll just suck it up.
Rikka
「...」
％Ｂ
「What? ...Narusawa?」
Natsuki
「Oh, Rikka. So you really did come!」
Rikka
「...It's not like I came because I wanted to.」
all
Marika
「Why are you here, Narusawa-san?」
％Ｂ
「We just happened to run into her while we were shopping yesterday. So we invited her to come along too.」

all
Rikka
「Though I said no.」
She's holding a small white plastic bag.
％Ｂ
「Yeah, but you still showed up. And you even brought extra ingredients. You're totally raring to go.」

Rikka
「What are you talking about? This is yours.」
％Ｂ
「What? ...Mine?」
I look inside the bag that's been thrust into my hands.
％Ｂ
「Oh... The medium-hot roux!? Is this the one I bought?」
Rikka
「You dropped it.」
Rikka
「I wanted to let you know, but I don't know how to contact you... So I came here to give it to you, since you said you would all be meeting up here.」

％Ｂ
「Oh really... Wow, that's great. Thanks.」
Rikka
「Whatever... Anyway, now that you got it back...」
％Ｂ
「Wait a second. You're not just gonna go home now, are you?」
Rikka
「I gave you what you dropped, so I don't need to be here.」
％Ｂ
「Of course you do. You gotta go camping.」
Natsuki
「That's right. You can't just leave now that you've shown up to the meeting spot on time.」


Rikka
「I told you, that was just to give you back―」
all
Marika
「Uh, um～ The bus is here!」
Misa
「It is! We will have to wait an hour if we miss that bus.」

Sora
「...We need to get on.」
Natsuki
「Hurry up, everyone! Sprint to the stop!」
％Ｂ
「C'mon, Narusawa! Hurry!」
Rikka
「...Huh? Huh!?」
Natsuki
「And we're heeere!」
Marika
「Wow... This is so nice!」
all
Misa
「We're surrounded by nature. It's wonderful!」
Sora
「...A good spot to see stars.」
Rikka
「...I actually came.」
all
Natsuki
「Huh? Looks like one of us is lagging behind.」
％Ｂ
「Kh... He...Heavy!」
Natsuki
「What, again?」
％Ｂ
「The water's too heavy! It's ten liters! That's ten kilos!」

And I'm carrying all that on my own.
It was hard enough just unloading everything from the bus...
all
Rikka
「So... Why did you bring water?」
％Ｂ
「What do you mean, why? ...You need water when you go camping.」
Rikka
「But isn't that a water pipe over there?」
all
She points to a shed with a big roof.
I can see a water faucet inside.
％Ｂ
「Oh, come on... You're kidding me.」
And it looks like there's even something like a bathroom next to that...
What was the point of all my hard work then?
％Ｂ
「Now that I think about it, I feel like they had that here when I was a kid, too... I should've done more research.」

Rikka
「I'm surprised you invited other people along without doing the proper research.」
％Ｂ
「Uuuh...」
all
But still, I'm sure we'll all deepen our friendship by having fun eating together.

What's more, we'll be here at a wide-open campground.
Today's looking like it's gonna be fun!
％Ｂ
「Now then, how about we get started making curry!」
Natsuki
「Trying to smooth over the emotional damage from realizing your effort in bringing water was useless, eh?」

％Ｂ
「Whatever! Let's start!」
all
We all start unpacking our ingredients.
We have everything we need to make curry.
Marika
「Wait, aren't we missing something～?」
Natsuki
「Huh? We have carrots, potatoes, onions... and Rikka brought the roux, so isn't this everything?」

all
Rikka
「What about rice?」
％Ｂ
「...Oh.」
There's the curry, but we don't have rice.
It's just sauce at this point.
all
％Ｂ
「Oh, crap.」
What a horrible mistake we've made...
％Ｂ
「What should we do? Won't be filling with just the curry sauce.」
Misa
「Let's see... We could get by if we had bread, but...」

Sora
「We... can't eat curry?」
all
Natsuki
「It's too early to give up! I'm gonna try asking someone if they can come right now!」

Marika
「I'll try asking someone too.」
Marika
「...Okay. No, it's okay. Sorry for asking so suddenly.」
Natsuki
「No dice for me too. They apparently have a match for their club today.」
Looks like Shinozaki and Segawa weren't able to find someone to bring rice.
I guess it'd be hard to find someone who just happens to be free, and would be open to suddenly coming here...

all
％Ｂ
「Worst-case scenario, I guess I could go back and buy some?」
Natsuki
「Speaking of which, weren't you gonna try asking someone to come
, Hino

? What happened with that?」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, I was thinking of asking Yukimura. I tried calling her this morning, but she didn't pick up.」

Marika
「You told her we were doing this, right? Maybe you could try asking one more time?」
all
Sora
「I... want to eat curry.」
Misa
「Yes, since we already went through this much trouble...」
Rikka
「...I don't really care either way. But I'd want to eat it since I'm here anyway.」
all
Natsuki
「Why not try calling her? We'll try some other leads too.」

％Ｂ
「Got it. I'll try asking her... but don't expect too much, all right? Even assuming she decides to show up.」

Marika
「Yeah, I think it's fine. It's not like we want her to come just to bring rice anyway.」

％Ｂ
「I'll call her, then.」
all
_smh_st_01
_smh_st_btn01
_SMH_ST_01
I wonder if she'll pick up...
_smh_st_02
_smh_st_btn02
_smh_st_02
_smh_st_btn05
Touko
『Yes, hello?』
％Ｂ
「Oh, Yukimura? Did you give any thought to what I was talking about yesterday?」

Touko
『Mhm, well, a bit?』
％Ｂ
「You wanna come now? You don't have to if you have other plans, though.」

Touko
『I don't have other plans, but you've started already, right? So I don't really need to come, do I?』

％Ｂ
「We should hang out if you don't have plans.」
Touko
『Mmm... I can't say I really feel like it.』
Hmm... Yukimura still just doesn't seem like she's into it.
I wish I had something more to try to get her to come.
Maybe I'll tell her about the rice problem.
I'll switch tack to a "Please come help us!" strategy.
％Ｂ
「Truth is... we've got a bit of an issue.」
Touko
『An issue?』
％Ｂ
「We're all going to make curry right now... but we forgot to bring rice.」

Touko
『Hmm. And so you'd like for me to bring rice on top of participating?』

％Ｂ
「Yeah. In a nutshell, yeah.」
％Ｂ
「I think it'd be awesome if we got you and rice in a single package.」
Touko
『Don't you think you're being a bit selfish?』
％Ｂ
「I know I am, but I'm just trying to think of an excuse to get you to come at this point.」
Touko
『...』
％Ｂ
「Oh, if the rice is heavy, then I can go come pick you up. I was already considering going back in the worst-case scenario anyway. Still don't wanna come?」


Touko
『...That'd just be inefficient. Fine, I get it. I'll help you.』
％Ｂ
「Seriously!? Thanks! You're a life-saver, Yukimura!」
Touko
『I'll come with rice if you agree to my condition. What's your answer to that?』

％Ｂ
「C-Condition?」
I wonder what it could be. I have no idea what it even could be.
What could Yukimura want from me? ...I can't really imagine anything. I've got a bad feeling about this.

％Ｂ
「What... kinda condition?」
Touko
『Could you do something about those clubs trying to recruit me? It's seriously annoying saying no to them all the time. I can't even nap in peace.』

％Ｂ
「The clubs trying to recruit you? Well, I get why you'd want that... but what could I do?」

Touko
『You have to think of that. I'll bring the rice if you say you'll do something about it.』

...Arghhh, I'll just have to do it!
I'll have all the time to think of ways to solve that problem later!
％Ｂ
「Fine! I'll do something about it, so please!」
Touko
『Okaaay. I'll get ready now and leave, so it'll be just a bit. Oh, and you won't need to pick me up.』

％Ｂ
「You can't seriously expect me to say okay to that. Let me know once you're over here. I'll come get you.」

Touko
『...Mm. I'll see you later, then.』
_smh_st_04
$$smh_OpenCHK
％Ｂ
「So... Yukimura says she'll bring rice.」

Natsuki
「Really!? You've done it
, Hino

! Good on you!」
Sora
「I want to eat curry... soon!」
all
Misa
「Yes, I'm very much looking forward to it! Shall we start doing what we can to prepare?」

％Ｂ
「Maybe we could wait until Yukimura gets here? It'll be more fun if we all do it together.」

Marika
「You're right. We want Yukimura-san to have fun too.」
all
I was pretty worried for a bit, but I'm glad Yukimura was there for us.

All that's left is to wait for her.
The girls each start killing time through conversation.
It's a bit tough being the only guy in a situation like this. It's kinda hard to join conversations.

all
I look around to see Narusawa standing alone, a bit apart from the others.

...Now that I think about it, Narusawa's the only one I don't have contact details for.
I wonder if she'd tell me if I asked.
％Ｂ
「Narusawa, can I ask you something?」
Rikka
「...?」
％Ｂ
「You've got a cell phone... right?」
Rikka
「Yes, I do.」
％Ｂ
「So could you tell me your mail address?」
Rikka
「...」
％Ｂ
「Huh!? Wh-What are you looking so suspicious for!?」
Rikka
「What are you planning on using it for?」
％Ｂ
「Obviously I'd use it to contact you.」
Rikka
「I don't really have anything to contact you over.」
％Ｂ
「Gh... You hate me, don't you?」
Rikka
「...Not really. I'm just saying the truth.」
It looks like she doesn't hate me.
But for some reason... what she said just now really hurt.
％Ｂ
「It'll be more convenient if you have my contact details in case something like today happens again, right?」

Natsuki
「And then once you get her contact info out of her, you're going to send her weird mail and phone calls every night?」


...Segawa had gotten behind me without me noticing. She's smirking.
％Ｂ
「Hey. Don't butt in.」
Rikka
「...Gross.」
％Ｂ
「...Please don't say that like you're spitting on me.」
％Ｂ
「I'm being pretty serious here, Segawa.」
Natsuki
「So he says, Rikka. He really wants to know your contact information.」

％Ｂ
「You...! No...! I didn't mean it that way!」
Natsuki
「So how'd you mean it, then?」
％Ｂ
「...Hm?」
If I don't have any ulterior motives, then I guess it's just I want exactly that?
No, but that has to be exactly what Segawa wants me to say.
But I don't want to deny it either. It'd be like lying.
％Ｂ
「Uhh... Yeah. I really wanna know.」
Natsuki
「Woah, what an intense confession～ And your response?」
Rikka
「I'm very sorry.」
％Ｂ
「I got rejected without even actually confessing!?」
Natsuki
「Now, now. No need to get so down. There are plenty other fish in the sea. Here, just look at all the cute girls we have here today!」

％Ｂ
「*sniff*... You're actually pretty nice, Segawa...」
She's patting me comfortingly on the back. I feel like I might be about to cry.

Though I do feel like this only happened because of Segawa...
Natsuki
「Ahaha. This is just way too pitiful for 
Hino 
him 
at this rate. Couldn't you at least give him your contact info out of pity? And to me too.」


Rikka
「...Fine.」
Narusawa pulls out her smartphone and starts tapping at it.
She holds it out. Her profile is displayed on the screen.

Natsuki
「Ohh! Hohoh, that's quite the cute mail address... I figured it'd just be your number.」

％Ｂ
「No one does that these days. You'll only get spam, and it's not good for security.」

Rikka
「I'm putting it away if you're not copying it down.」
％Ｂ
「Aghh, wait! I'll type it in right away, just one second. Let's see, hmhm...」

all
Segawa and I copy her mail address off of the screen.
Done registering.
％Ｂ
「My turn next.」
I send my own profile to the mail address I just registered.

％Ｂ
「Put me down in your phone, okay?」
Rikka
「If I have time.」
％Ｂ
「...It won't even take a minute.」
Are you that against registering my contact info?
Seems like Segawa's done sending her own details.
all
％Ｂ
「Why don't you exchange addresses with the others too?」
Rikka
「Huh?」
％Ｂ
「You might as well, since we all came here camping together.」
Rikka
「I recall being more or less forced to come.」
％Ｂ
「That doesn't matter, does it? Live in the present.」
Rikka
「...That's true. I can't change the fact that I'm here. Doing something would be more worthwhile. Though your reasoning is just as forceful as Segawa-san's.」


％Ｂ
「That's right. Having fun with the others has to be a better use of your time.」
all
％Ｂ
「Hey, everyone! Come over here for a bit!」
I yell out, waving the others over from their conversations.
It's time to start the great mail address exchange.
all
％Ｂ
「Okay, this is everyone.」
We all exchange addresses.
I've already got Narusawa's address registered in my phone, of course.
This is kinda nice. It's a kind of camaraderie.
％Ｂ
「I'll contact you on LIME later.」
Rikka
「LIME? Why not mail?」
％Ｂ
「Mail's fine, but we've got a group chat. So I was thinking you could be in that group too.」

Rikka
「I see. I've never used it before, though.」
％Ｂ
「Really? I've actually only just started using it myself. I can teach you.」

all
I start by showing her how to install the app.
The download and installation finishes.
Though it really isn't that complex. It's pretty much the same as mail once you register contacts.

Rikka
「I've pretty much got it now. I don't know if I'll ever send any messages, though.」

％Ｂ
「You don't have to be the one to start conversations, but if you could at least reply...」

all
_00cutinBS
Touko
「Hahhhh～ ...Pheeew... I-I'm tired... No more...」
_00cutinBS
I can see a staggering figure off in the distance.
She looks like she's being crushed under her backpack.
Misa
「Oh no! We should go help immediately!」
％Ｂ
「You all right!? I told you to let me know when you got here!」
We sprint over to Yukimura, who looks like she's about to keel over.

％Ｂ
「Thanks a lot, Yukimura. You've really helped us out.」
Touko
「I'm sooo tired. Glug, glug... hafhhh. Water tastes so goood.」

all
％Ｂ
「Now that we've got rice, I think it's time to finally start cooking.」

％Ｂ
「And so there's something we need to decide on first.」
all
Marika
「We need to decide on who's doing what.」
all
Natsuki
「Yes, me! I want to make the fire!」
She excitedly raises her hand.
％Ｂ
「You sure? I was thinking of making the fire, since it's dangerous.」

Natsuki
「Just leave it to me! It'll be easy-peasy once I get serious!」
％Ｂ
「If you really want to that badly, then you can be in charge of the fire, Segawa.」
Touko
「Me neeext. Rice! I want to cook the rice! I brought it, so I can cook it, right?」

％Ｂ
「Yukimura handles the rice, then.」
all
％Ｂ
「For the other stuff...」
We end up with Ousaka cutting the vegetables, and Shinozaki cooking the meat.
all
Narusawa seasons the curry, and Okihara-senpai gets water and acts as an all-around helper.

all
％Ｂ
「I think that's all of the roles. Hm... Wait.」
Marika
「There's one person who doesn't have a role yet...」
％Ｂ
「I completely forgot about myself... Is there anything I can do?」

Rikka
「You literally just said that we divided up all the roles.」

％Ｂ
「I know I did, but...」
It sucks being the only one without something to do.
all
Misa
「Perhaps you could just help everyone with their roles?」

Natsuki
「That's probably fine, isn't it? You can just kinda lend a hand to anyone who you think needs it.」

Sora
「...Helper.」
She points her thumb up at me.
Natsuki
「Okay, let's start cooking!!」
％Ｂ
「Wha, wait...!」
They all go to their respective spots, leaving me alone in the blink of an eye.
I feel like the girls have gotten a lot closer in a short amount of time.
all
％Ｂ
「I can't let myself just sit here either.」
％Ｂ
「I need to support everyone with everything I've got.」
Now then, who should I help?
Ousaka
Shinozaki
Segawa
Okihara-senpai
Narusawa
Yukimura
_00com
_00com
_00com
_00com
_00com
_00com
Guess I'll help Ousaka.
％Ｂ
「Ousaka, I'm here to help with whatever you want.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
She's silently peeling vegetables.
She seems pretty well practiced.
％Ｂ
「Huh, you're pretty good. Are you good at cooking?」
Sora
「...I'm not bad at it.」
I'm surprised. I thought she was only interested in stars.
％Ｂ
「Here, I'll peel some too. There's an extra knife, right?」
all
I grab the spare knife and start peeling potatoes.
Sora
「...You're good.」
％Ｂ
「I'm pretty good with my hands. Peeling vegetables is easy compared to building models.」

Sora
「...Models?」
％Ｂ
「I'm trying to become an architect. So I make model houses from scratch and stuff.」

Sora
「...Wow.」
％Ｂ
「Hm? What?」
Sora
「...You're already thinking about your future.」
％Ｂ
「It's not that big a deal. Is there anything you wanna do, Ousaka? Wanna watch the stars for the rest of your life or something?」


Sora
「For the rest of my life... I think that'd make me really happy.」

It's only slightly, but she smiles.
But still, I wonder what kind of job would let you just watch stars.
Maybe a researcher for space exploration or something?
That sounds... way more impressive than an architect.
all
％Ｂ
「Hup. Like this, I guess?」
I wash the first potato.
I'm satisfied. It's quite beautifully done, if I do say so myself.
％Ｂ
「I'll handle the rest of the potatoes, so you should do the carrots and onions, Ousaka.」

Sora
「...*nod*」
all
％Ｂ
「...All right! Potatoes done!」
I've peeled the potatoes at a reasonable pace.
Next up is cutting these and rounding them so they don't fall apart while they simmer.
％Ｂ
「How are things over there, Ousaka?」
Sora
「...*sniff*」
％Ｂ
「Uh...」
Tears are running down her cheeks.
It's because of the onions.
Sora
「...Stings.」
％Ｂ
「Y-You all right? Wanna trade places?」
Sora
「...*shake shake*」
％Ｂ
「No, you don't have to force yourself. I'll do the rest of the onions, so you just round off the potatoes.」

Sora
「...*shake shake*」
...What are you being stubborn about this for?
％Ｂ
「Uhh... Hey, Ousaka. Just between you and me... I actually love cutting onions.」


Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「What can I say? I just love that crunch when you cut into them. It gets me so excited it makes me wanna cry.」

Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「So can I cut those onions? It's okay, right? Please. I wanna cut up those onions.」

％Ｂ
「I wanna feel that crunch so bad, I can't take it anymore... Hahh, hahh, hahh... C'mon, let me cut them... Let me cut them uuup...」


...What kinda freak am I trying to come off as?
Sora
「...Mm.」
She finally lets me do it.
％Ｂ
「Oh, thanks. Here, you can cut these potatoes, then.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
We trade potatoes and onions and continue working.
all
Sora
「...Shaping complete. How about...?」
％Ｂ
「Uuuh... *sniff*... Hgh...」
Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「Y-You've got it wrong... These are tears of joy... *sniff*... I'm just so happy that I get to cut onions... Hgh...」

Man, this was a stupid character concept.
I'm almost done, so I just need to suck it up...
Sora
「...」
Ousaka pulls a handkerchief out from her pocket.
％Ｂ
「...Hm?」
She brings her face close to mine.
％Ｂ
「H-Hey, Ousaka... That's dangerous...」
Sora
「...No issues.」
She takes her handkerchief and gently dabs at my eyes.
％Ｂ
「Huh?」
Is she wiping my tears?
Sora
「...It doesn't solve the problem, though.」
％Ｂ
「Oh... Yeah... but it helps.」
More importantly... your face... is really close...
Sora
「...」
My heart's beating faster from having her face be so close to mine...
Plus, I smell something really nice, too...
Sora
「...There.」
％Ｂ
「R-Right... Thanks.」
My eyes still sting, but at least I can see again.
I can see the potatoes that Ousaka's finished cutting now.
％Ｂ
「...Hey. What are those?」
Sora
「...Vegetables.」
％Ｂ
「No... I didn't mean that...」
Sora
「Potatoes and carrots.」
％Ｂ
「...Why are the potatoes cut into stars?」
That, and the carrots are cut into crescent moons.
They've been more cut into shapes than rounded.
％Ｂ
「That's pretty impressive...」
Sora
「I'm sure they'll taste good.」
％Ｂ
「You think so...」
Sora
「...*nod*」
Though I feel like those potatoes are gonna crumble and disintegrate into the curry... I wonder if it'll be okay?

I walk over to see how Shinozaki's doing to find...
Marika
「Fueeehh～」
Her standing there, crying!
％Ｂ
「H-Hey, what's wrong? Did you hurt yourself or something?」

Marika
「Oh... No, no I didn't! I'm fine. I've been grating onions this whole time, so...」

％Ｂ
「Oh, it's because of the onions. I got scared 'cause I thought you cut your finger or something.」

％Ｂ
「Huh? But why are you grating onions? Aren't you in charge of cooking the meat?」


Marika
「Yeah, I am. Even cheap meat becomes softer and tastier when you marinate it in grated onions.」


％Ｂ
「Huh～ That's a pretty nifty tip. You must be pretty good at cooking.」

Marika
「Oh, um, you see... I actually learned this from my mom for today. See?」


She pulls out her smartphone and holds it out to me.
It's a detailed set of notes with tips and things to be careful of when making curry.

Marika
「I'm just doing what this says. So it's not that impressive...」

％Ｂ
「No, I bet you put a lot of work into writing all these notes. You're really into this, huh?」

Marika
「Because I want everyone to have something good to eat while we're here. It'd definitely be more fun that way. Everyone's happier when they're eating good food... right?」


％Ｂ
「That sounds just like you, Shinozaki. But I totally understand what you're saying. I'll help out too.」


I'm inspired by Shinozaki's passion to help out with the meat.
We face the grill over the fire that Segawa managed to get started.
Marika
「Okay, then I'm going to grill this marinated meat. Can you help me with that?」

She takes out a small white cube and starts smearing it on the grill.

％Ｂ
「You even brought beef fat?」
Marika
「Yeah. I got wagyu beef fat at the butcher's. Using good beef tallow apparently makes it more fragrant... This is more of my mom's advice.」


Shinozaki looks happy explaining.
Just listening to this makes me feel like it'll come out great.
Marika
「So, first we get a proper sear on the outside to seal the flavor tight into the meat.」

％Ｂ
「All right. I can do that.」
all
％Ｂ
「Whoa!?」
Oil spatters off of the grill just as I'm about to place the meat down on it.
Marika
「W-Wow. Maybe the fire's a bit too hot?」

all
Marika
「Kyah!」
She clutches my upper arm when more oil splatters.
％Ｂ
「You okay? Did you get any burns?」
Marika
「Oh, yeah, I'm fine...」
％Ｂ
「You sure? Let me see.」
Marika
「O-Oh～」
I grab her arm and look closely to check for burns.
Shinozaki's arm might have gotten healthier-looking since she was a kid, but her skin's still surprisingly pale, and her arm itself is slender.

％Ｂ
「...Yeah. Looks like you're okay.」
Marika
「I was just surprised. I didn't get any oil on me.」

％Ｂ
「But we should be careful. You stand over there for a bit.」
all
I lay down piece after piece of meat onto the crackling grill while Shinozaki stays a safe distance away.\n\r

It was loud at first, but it doesn't take long to quiet down.
％Ｂ
「Okay, we should be fine now. It's all good once the water evaporates.」

Marika
「Th-Thanks～ You know... boys sure are amazing.」

％Ｂ
「No, it's not that big of a deal. All I did was lay meat down on a grill.」

Marika
「No, I'm glad you were here.」
％Ｂ
「I'm glad I was helpful... Okay. Does that look good?」

Marika
「Oh, I'll help too.」
We grill the cut faces of the meat, checking the color as we go. It doesn't take long before a nice smell starts wafting around us.

Marika
「...That smells good.」
％Ｂ
「There's no way this isn't gonna taste good. Looks like all that crying you did while grating the onions was worth it.」

Marika
「Yeah, I hope so. My hands smell so much like onions now...」

She sniffs at her fingertips and frowns.
％Ｂ
「Really?」
Marika
「Oh...」
I grab Shinozaki's hand and try sniffing.
％Ｂ
「Sniff, sniff... Oh, you're right. It really does smell like onions.」

Marika
「I-I told you so～ Don't smeeell...」

％Ｂ
「Well, this is fine in a way, isn't it? You smell really tasty right now.」

Marika
「D-Do I? Thanks... I guess it's weird to say thanks, but...」

％Ｂ
「Ahaha, yeah.」
Marika
「Right? Ehehe...」
％Ｂ
「I guess I'll go take a look at what Segawa's doing.」
She volunteered to start the fire, but I wonder if she'll really be okay.

％Ｂ
「It's pretty hard starting a fire from logs, after all.」
I walk over to the fire pit to see how Segawa's doing.
％Ｂ
「How's it going, Segawa? Got something started?」
Natsuki
「Don't worry. I'm about to get serious...」
％Ｂ
「So that means you haven't gotten the fire going yet, then.」
Natsuki
「...It's so strange. Wood usually burns, doesn't it? Are all these logs damp or something?」

％Ｂ
「Looks like you're having some issues.」
all
I sit down next to Segawa and take a look.
％Ｂ
「Ah... I see.」
The logs are just heaped randomly in the pit.
I can tell she's been trying for a while now. There are burnt-up tatters of newspaper and slightly burnt logs nearby.

％Ｂ
「Well... I figured something like this might happen.」
Natsuki
「What the heck... What's that supposed to mean?」
％Ｂ
「There's a trick to it.」
I rearrange the logs in the pit.
％Ｂ
「You need to arrange the logs so there's a gap in the middle to make an open passage for air. Then you put twigs and leaves as kindling in that gap.」


％Ｂ
「And when you light the newspaper, you shouldn't use it unfolded like this. You should crumple it up, and then light it with a match.」

％Ｂ
「Don't get scared and toss it in right away. Wait until the fire gets going a bit, and then put it into the middle of the logs.」


％Ｂ
「That way, the fire spreads to the leaves and twigs first, and then it spreads around to the logs.」

And just like I said, the fire grows after burning the twigs and spreads to the logs.


Natsuki
「Ohhh...」
％Ｂ
「See? It's easy once you know the trick, isn't it?」
Natsuki
「Wow, wow! You're actually pretty good!」
％Ｂ
「Guess I am. I've gone camping a few times before in the past, and I learned how to do this back then.」

Natsuki
「Wow, really. I guess you can't judge a book by its cover.」
％Ｂ
「I should be the one saying that. I thought the exact same thing when you volunteered to start the fire. "Huh, so she can start a fire from wood? Wow. Guess you shouldn't judge a book by its cover."」


Natsuki
「Eheheh, right?」
％Ｂ
「Though you weren't actually able to do that, you know.」
Natsuki
「Eheheh... Right.」
％Ｂ
「Why'd you volunteer if you didn't even know how to do it?」
Natsuki
「Huh? Well 'cause it's like a campfire, and that's like a springtime of youth thing, right? I thought it sounded fun.」

％Ｂ
「...That's not an actual reason. And it's a fire for cooking, not a campfire.」

Natsuki
「They're similar enough. And you wouldn't wanna see one of the others sitting there covered in smoke and coughing, right? So I thought I'd take that job.」


％Ｂ
「...So you were being considerate of the others?」
Natsuki
「It's a self-sacrifice. Camping's all about helping each other out.」
％Ｂ
「I see...」
So that's why...
％Ｂ
「Sorry, Segawa. I was thinking something rude.」
Natsuki
「Huh? What were you thinking?」
％Ｂ
「I was thinking that you volunteered to start the fire 'cause you weren't good at cooking or something and wanted to avoid it.」

Natsuki
「...」
％Ｂ
「I wanted to say sorry for thinking that.」
Natsuki
「Ha... Haha... Ahahaha, y-yeah, right! Yeah, right! There's no way, ahahahaaah!」

...Is it just me, or does she seem pretty nervous?
Natsuki
「H-Huh? Hey... is the fire getting smaller?」
％Ｂ
「Whoops... You got a fan or something? Newspaper works too.」
Natsuki
「Huh? A fan? Let's see... No, I don't. We used up all the newspaper too.」

％Ｂ
「Okay... Guess there's no other option.」
all
I crouch down in front of the fire pit and blow hard.
％Ｂ
「Fhhhhhh!」
The fire grows, and the logs crackle.
％Ｂ
「Fhhhhhh!」
Natsuki
「Wha... Wow!」
The fire's back to its original intensity after a few more times of doing that.
％Ｂ
「Phew... Usually you use a fan or something to send new air in. That was an emergency fix.」

Natsuki
「I'll help too, then.」
％Ｂ
「No, it's fine. You'll breathe in ashes and stuff. It's not something a girl should do.」

Natsuki
「Really?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. Just let me handle this... Fhhhhh! Ungh!? Kaff, cough!?」

Natsuki
「A-Are you okay!?」
％Ｂ
「Y-Yeah... Cough... See? This is what happens... Kaff...」
Natsuki
「Pff... Khhh... Ahahahahah!」
％Ｂ
「Uh?」
Segawa suddenly starts laughing after looking at me.
％Ｂ
「What? ...Is there something weird going on?」
Natsuki
「It... It's because... you... have a beard... Pfff...!」
％Ｂ
「A beard?」
Natsuki
「Yeah. I'll get it off, so don't move... Hehe.」
She extends her hand toward my face.
Natsuki
「Here. You've got ashes stuck to your face, and it looks like a beard.」
She touches right below my nose.
％Ｂ
「Hgh...」
Natsuki
「Oh, sorry. I smeared it so you look like an English gentleman.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, come on...」
Natsuki
「Here, I said not to move.」
She rubs at it with her fingers.
It's pretty nerve-racking having your face touched by a girl...
Natsuki
「Mmm... This should be okay.」
％Ｂ
「...」
Natsuki
「Okay, done. You're good now.」
％Ｂ
「...」
Natsuki
「What's wrong? I said you're good now.」
％Ｂ
「R-Right... Thanks.」
Natsuki
「Nah, no need to thank me.」
Crap... My heart's still hammering away.
％Ｂ
「Now that I think about it, where did Okihara-senpai go?」
I feel like I haven't seen her in a while.
Just where did she go?
％Ｂ
「Heeey, Shinozaki. You see Okihara-senpai anywhere?」

I try asking Shinozaki, who's currently grilling meat.
Marika
「I saw her carrying a bunch of plastic bottles. She might've gone to go get water.」

％Ｂ
「Thanks. I'll go check up on her.」

all
The water's that way.
After walking a bit, I spot her standing and talking in front of something that looks like an administrative building.

She's holding plastic bottles, just like Shinozaki said.
Misa
「I see, I see! So that's why it's this cold!」

I'm pretty sure she's talking to one of the old manager people.
They look like they're having a pleasant conversation.
％Ｂ
「I'll hold those for you, Senpai.」
She notices me when I call out to her, and smiles.
I take a pretty decent number of plastic bottles from her.
Misa
「Thank you very much. I'll be leaving, then.」

all
She gives a polite bow, and we part ways with the old man.
％Ｂ
「What were you talking about?」
Misa
「Well, it seems that this drinking water is water from a well.」

Misa
「That's why it's this cold, despite it being summer.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, it really is crazy cold. I almost thought it might've been stored in a fridge.」

I feel like my fingertips might go numb if I hold them for much longer.
Misa
「And the amazing thing is, it's apparently warmer in the winter. Nature is very mysterious, isn't it?」

She loves aquariums and marine life.
I'm sure she also feels strongly about nature in general.
Misa
「...Actually, would you like to try drinking a bit beforehand, just the two of us?」
She smiles a bit mischievously.
It's a playful expression that seems to say, "Our little secret."
％Ｂ
「That sounds nice. Let's do that. Let's swear not to tell the others.」

Misa
「Of course. It will be just between the two of us.」

We smile at each other furtively.
Little plots like these are fun.
Even though all we're doing is drinking the water a bit before everyone else.
Misa
「Would it be all right if I went first? I am the one responsible for the water, after all.」

％Ｂ
「Yes, of course. You may have the honor of experiencing the first drink.」

Misa
「Hehe... Thank you very much.」
She smiles happily and brings the bottle to her lips.
Misa
「Nkh, nkhnkh... Pfah.」
％Ｂ
「How is it?」
Misa
「It's very delicious! So clear and refreshing! You should also try some

, Ryousuke-san!」
!」

She hands me the still-open bottle.
％Ｂ
「Huh? Uh...」
I hesitate.
Misa
「...Is something the matter? Oh, don't worry, it's meant for drinking. They apparently also run tests on its quality as well.」


％Ｂ
「No, I trust them on that front, but...」
But she just drank from this.
Though it doesn't seem like she herself seems to mind at all. Maybe I'm just too conscious about it...

％Ｂ
「I'll have some, then.」
all
I casually bring the bottle to my mouth, trying to appear not the least concerned.

％Ｂ
「Oh... This is...」
Misa
「How is it? Isn't it good?」
％Ｂ
「This tastes great! I didn't expect water from a well to taste this good!」

Misa
「Isn't it!? It's genuinely delicious.」
Misa
「...Why don't the two of us drink this whole bottle together? As a secret between the two of us, of course.」

She smiles mischievously again as she presses for secrecy.
％Ｂ
「Of course. I won't tell anyone, since we're accomplices.」

Misa
「When we fall, we fall together.」
We smile at each other again.
I feel like sharing in this silly little secret might've let me get closer with Okihara-senpai.

％Ｂ
「Anything I can help with, Narusawa?」
I call out to Narusawa as she prepares the pot.
Rikka
「No.」
％Ｂ
「Pretty blunt, huh? I've got nothing to do while the others are all working.」

％Ｂ
「I feel weird not doing anything. Is there really nothing I can help with?」

Rikka
「Could you go grab the vegetables that Ousaka-san's finished cutting, then?」

％Ｂ
「Sure thing! Leave it to me!」
％Ｂ
「I've got them.」
Rikka
「Thank you. Leave them there.」
She puts a bit of oil in the thick-bottomed pot and starts heating it up.
She's using the fire that Segawa's started.
Segawa looked pretty exhausted when I passed her on the way here... It must've taken a lot of work.

But she had a huge grin on, like she had accomplished something incredible.

％Ｂ
「Anything else I can help with? I'll do anything.」

Rikka
「Nothing really. Why don't you go help one of the others?」
％Ｂ
「I thought of that, but no one has any work for me to do.」

％Ｂ
「I tried asking about each of their situations while I was going around grabbing stuff, but everyone just said, "You should go help the others"...」

Rikka
「Looks like they were just handing you off to each other.」
％Ｂ
「I'm starting to feel like no one needs me...」
Rikka
「And so you came crying to me.」
％Ｂ
「It's embarrassing, but that's how it is. Please, let me help with something.」

Rikka
「I'm more used to doing this by myself...」
％Ｂ
「...I'll go play in the river. Please tell me once you're all finished.」
Rikka
「...Have you ever made curry before?」
％Ｂ
「I've helped my parents before. I can't honestly say I'd be confident doing it all by myself.」
Rikka
「Want to watch me make it, then? You live alone, right? You should at least learn how to make curry.」


Rikka
「The back of the packaging tells you how to make it, but I think it'll be easier to remember if you watch in person.」

％Ｂ
「Oh... Yes, please! I won't get in your way!」
all
I stand in a spot where I won't cause Narusawa any trouble so I can watch her work.
She starts tossing in the vegetables that I brought into the pot.
She suddenly stops partway through.
％Ｂ
「What's wrong?」
Rikka
「Are these... stars?」
％Ｂ
「Looks like it.」
The potatoes are cut into stars.
There are crescent-shaped carrots too.
Ousaka was the one in charge of cutting the vegetables.
It's easy enough to imagine her happily cutting them into astronomy-related shapes.

Rikka
「They'll soften and crumble once we simmer them.」
％Ｂ
「I'd feel a bit bad about that...」
％Ｂ
「Oh, I read something about how photo shoots are done for curry packaging before. I remember something about cooking them separately for those...」


Rikka
「...That's true. We can simmer them separately.」
％Ｂ
「I'll get another pot, then.」
The star potatoes bounce happily inside the pot.
Narusawa adds the meat that Shinozaki was in charge of to the pot that she had been grilling the vegetables in.
She adds in an amber-colored paste.
％Ｂ
「What's that?」
Rikka
「They're onions that I grilled until they were golden brown. I made them earlier.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, are these like a secret ingredient or something?」
Rikka
「More or less. They add a natural sweetness. You can add worcestershire sauce or instant coffee to it to make the flavor deeper too.」


She mixes it a bit and adds water.
％Ｂ
「This is great for learning. You really do know a lot.」
Rikka
「...That's not true. I just learned all this on my own out of necessity.」

％Ｂ
「I feel like I'd just end up relying on instant or premade food.」
Rikka
「It becomes habit after a while. To the point where it feels strange not to cook.」

％Ｂ
「You say it like it's easy, but I think I'd have trouble getting used to it.」

I guess that means she's lived alone for just that long...
all
Rikka
「...」
She neatly removes the lye with a ladle.
Now that I think about it, I've never really sat down and watched a girl cook before.

This is kinda nice.
It's just really girly. Kinda homey...
I end up watching Narusawa for a while, specifically her back.

I come to my senses once the pot starts making bubbling sounds.
She removes the lid from the pot.
Rikka
「You get lumps from the roux otherwise.」
％Ｂ
「What?」
Rikka
「You were looking at me like you wanted to know why I did that. Am I wrong?」
％Ｂ
「No, that was exactly why... Mm, okay. That's good to know. Thanks.」

I was just a bit surprised, since Narusawa's never been the one to start talking on her own before.

Maybe I can view that as her being a little more comfortable around me.
She places the roux in the ladle, and carefully dissolves it into the water while stirring with a pair of long chopsticks.

The delicious smell of curry wafts over to me.
She places the lid back onto the pot, to let it simmer.
％Ｂ
「Hey, Narusawa. You sure there's nothing I can help with?」
Rikka
「Could you taste-test for me, then?」
She scoops up some curry in the ladle, puts it in a paper bowl, and hands it to me.
％Ｂ
「Mm... Slrp.」
Rikka
「How is it?」
％Ｂ
「Let's see... I think I might like it a bit stronger.」
Rikka
「Is that so... Mm... chu...」
％Ｂ
「Uh...」
I'm standing there, mouth agape.
Because Narusawa put her lips on the same paper bowl that I did.
Uh... Is this an indirect kiss?
No, no, no. Wait. I can't let myself get so shaken up over this.
Just look. Narusawa doesn't seem to mind at all.
Rikka
「About this much?」
She hands me the paper bowl again after making some adjustments.
It's the same one as last time.
And of course it is. It'd be a waste to use a new one every time.
The issue is what I see before me.
The imprint of a pair of lips, clearly smaller than my own.
She's holding it so the part where she put her lips is facing out toward me.
If I taste it like this, I'll definitely end up putting my own lips on the same spot.

Is it really okay to do that? Narusawa doesn't seem to care, but still...

Rikka
「What's wrong? It won't taste as good if it gets cold.」
％Ｂ
「R-Right.」
Just taste it like this.
Rotate the bowl first.
It'd be weirder to be all nervous and purposefully rotate the bowl when Narusawa's looking.

Yeah. It'd be absolutely bizarre. Or at least, that's what I tell myself.
I bring my lips closer. My back feels strangely sweaty.
I can see Narusawa's kiss mark right there, coming closer...
An indirect... kiss...
％Ｂ
「...Slurp.」
Rikka
「How is it?」
％Ｂ
「W-Well... Yep, yep! I think that tastes great!」
I have no idea what it tasted like. I was too nervous.
I casually turn the bowl.
I'm a wimp.
％Ｂ
「...Slurp.」
Rikka
「How is it?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, something like this. This is about perfect!」
Rikka
「Do you like it when it tastes like this
, Hino-kun

?」
％Ｂ
「It's 'cause it tastes like my family's curry. It might just be that I'm used to it.」

％Ｂ
「Though I guess we shouldn't cater to just my tastes.」
Rikka
「I think it's fine. We can think of it as the taste-tester's privilege.」
％Ｂ
「Haha, fair enough.」
I'm in higher spirits from hearing how her voice sounds more casual than usual.

Rikka
「I usually don't have others taste for me, so this is new.」

％Ｂ
「I'll taste-test for you anytime you want me to.」
Rikka
「...Are you actually trying to invite yourself over this time?」
Rikka
「...Are you trying to invite yourself over?」
％Ｂ
「Where'd that come from?」
Rikka
「You said you'd taste-test my food for me again.」
％Ｂ
「Conversations are like a game of catch! There's momentum and stuff!」
Rikka
「So you didn't really mean that?」
％Ｂ
「No, of course I did. But I wasn't thinking about forcing myself into your house or anything.」

Rikka
「But you still want to taste-test.」
％Ｂ
「We're back to square one!?」
Rikka
「It's because you keep saying things that I don't know how to respond to. But...」

Rikka
「I'll ask you to do it again if the opportunity arises.」
％Ｂ
「...I wish you could've just said that from the start.」
...Honestly now.
all
I try to clean up, so I can at least help a bit.
But Narusawa's apparently really practiced at cooking. She cleans up as she cooks.

It's over before I know it. There was almost nothing for me to do.
％Ｂ
「I'm done cleaning up, Narusawa... Wow, this is amazing.」
There's another dish that appeared while I was cleaning.
There's a salad full of vegetables now.
Rikka
「It's a side dish.」
％Ｂ
「That sounds great. Living alone means it's even harder for me to eat vegetables. I don't remember anyone bringing all these vegetables, though.」

Rikka
「I bought what we needed over there. There's a direct produce shop.」

She points at a building with lots of baskets lined up in front.
There are banners with "Locally grown" and stuff written on them.
Maybe she felt conscious of the fact that she was the only one who didn't bring anything?
She doesn't need to worry about that. We pretty much forced her to come with us anyway.
Though it'd be tactless of me to say that now.
I should just express my gratitude instead.
％Ｂ
「Thanks. The salad looks great.」
Rikka
「I made some dressing with what we had on hand and some vegetables too.」

Rikka
「This is a Japanese-style soy sauce dressing, and this one's more like thousand island.」

Rikka
「I didn't actually have all of the ingredients I needed, so I could only make approximations, but I think they should taste close enough.」

％Ｂ
「...」
Rikka
「What's wrong? Do you not like those dressings?」
％Ｂ
「No, it's just... Nah. It's nothing. I think they both sound great. I'm looking forward to eating the salad.」

Rikka
「What's that supposed to mean? Saying it like that only makes me more curious.」
I've never seen this slightly disgruntled expression of hers before.
It looks like she's still enjoying the camping trip. I'm so happy.

I walk over to see how Yukimura's doing with the rice.
I find her struggling with the outdoor cooking kit.
％Ｂ
「How's the rice coming along, Yukimura?」
Touko
「...I don't know how to use this. I thought this was going to be the easiest job!」
％Ｂ
「I'll help you. Let's wash the rice first... Oh, this is prewashed.」
Touko
「That's right. That's why I volunteered to cook the rice, because I thought it'd be the least work. Isn't there an electric rice cooker here?」

％Ｂ
「Of course there isn't... And rice tastes better when you cook it in these.」

Touko
「I don't care how it's cooked as long as it's edible. I'm hungry.」
％Ｂ
「The preparation's the fun part. I'm not too confident myself though, so let's look up how to cook it.」

Touko
「Huh? Look it up? ...How?」
％Ｂ
「I'm gonna use my phone. Just a second.」
I start up a web search.
I pick one of the search results and walk myself through how to use the outdoor cooking kit to cook rice.
Touko
「Wow～ That's so useful! I didn't know you could do stuff like that!」
％Ｂ
「...You know your phone can do the same thing, right?」
Touko
「Huh? Really? Mmm... It'll be fastest for someone who knows what they're doing to do this. Okay! I'll leave the rice to you!」

％Ｂ
「...Okay, sure. So you add water up to the line...」
Touko
「I like my rice a little on the harder side. Use a little less water... Oh, I want crispy rice! You can make crispy rice in these, right!?」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, you can. You probably get it from the rice that touches the cooker directly.」
Touko
「I think I'll have a bigger share of that! I brought the rice, and I'm in charge of the rice, so that should be fine, right?」

％Ｂ
「I think it's fine. The rice'll come out great as long as we keep an eye on the heat and time, so let's do our best.」

Touko
「Mmmhehe! I'm looking forward to it!」
She smiles and fixes her eyes on the cooker.
It looks like she's enjoying herself. I'm relieved.
％Ｂ
「Oh, right, I still need to thank you properly. Thanks, Yukimura.」

Touko
「Huh? For what?」
％Ｂ
「For the rice. We would've had to just eat the sauce for dinner if you hadn't come.」

Touko
「Oh, that's what you're talking about. It's not a big deal. I just happened to be in the mood.」


％Ｂ
「It was heavy and a pain to carry, right?」
Touko
「It really was. It was heavy, and it was hot, and I was tired, and I got hungry. I don't think good food's going to be enough to make that worth it.」

％Ｂ
「Talking about the condition from earlier?」
Touko
「That's right. Don't forget, okay? I'm going to have you do good work for me.」

％Ｂ
「Work for you, huh... Can't you just tell them that you don't plan on joining any clubs?」

Touko
「I wouldn't be having a hard time with all this if that worked. Anyway, good luck～」

％Ｂ
「Okay. I'll think of something. Okay, next comes the rice.」
all
We move to the fire pit.
The logs crackle in the fire that apparently took Segawa a lot of effort to start up.

Natsuki
「Sigh... I fiiinally did it! Stoves are amazing! They can start fires with just the press of a button.」

％Ｂ
「Good work, Segawa. We're ready to cook the rice, so we're gonna use the fire.」

Natsuki
「Be careful when you use it, okay? If you put it out, then I'm gonna have to put out your consciousness.」

...That's just terrifying.
all
This fire's the fruit of Segawa's hard work. I should treat it preciously.
％Ｂ
「Set this here... Okay. We can apparently take it off the flame after about twenty minutes.」

all
Touko
「Okaaay. Oh, how are we going to measure the time?」

％Ｂ
「My phone can set timers, so I guess I'll just use that.」
Touko
「I'll leave the rest to you then, okay? I'm going to go explore for a bit.」

％Ｂ
「Wha, hey... Yukimura!?」
She just up and left before I could stop her.
I'm the only one who's actually done anything with the rice!
all
％Ｂ
「It's done!」
The curry that I got to taste-test smells incredibly appetizing.

I taste the completed curry.
％Ｂ
「...Mgmgh.」
Natsuki
「How is it?」
Marika
「I thought it came out good...」
all
Misa
「How does it taste?」
Sora
「...Gulp.」
all
Touko
「This is kinda exciting.」
Rikka
「...He sure is taking his time.」
all
％Ｂ
「～～～～!」
％Ｂ
「It's good!」
all

「Hooraaaay!」
Misa
「Then let's immediately serve everyone else's portions too.」
Natsuki
「And after that, I'm taking photos!」
Marika
「Oh, I want to take one with my phone, too. I'm going to send it to my mom.」
Touko
「I like that idea. I'll do that too.」
all
Rikka
「...Maybe I'll do that too.」
all
Natsuki
「Why don't we just all take a photo and share them over LIME?」
Misa
「That's a good idea.」
all
Touko
「Do you all use LIME?」
％Ｂ
「Do you?」
Touko
「It looks like I have the app, but I don't use it at all. I don't know how to use it, and I don't know anyone's contact details either.」

％Ｂ
「We can tell you ours, then.」
Touko
「Huh, you all use it together? You too, Piano-chan?」
Rikka
「P-Piano-chan!?」
Touko
「You always play piano after school, right? So you're Piano-chan.」

Natsuki
「Just give up, Rikka. I'm Camera-chan...」
Marika
「Ahahaaa～ ...I'm Flower-chan.」
Touko
「Isn't it cute?」
Rikka
「No it's not. A piano's an instrument. You're going to be... uh, uhh～...」

Natsuki
「Exactly. I tried to think of a good nickname for her too, but all I could think of was "Transfer Student."」


Touko
「So anyway. Do you use it too, Piano-chan?」
Rikka
「...I was forced into it earlier.」
％Ｂ
「How about you try it too, Yukimura? It's easy enough to use.」
Touko
「I don't know how to exchange contact information either, so I'll do it if you'll do everything for me.」

Natsuki
「Anyway, let's take a photo first! Let's all take one together first!」

Sora
「...Mgmg... Gulp.」
Natsuki
「Wait, Sora, you're eating already!?」
all
Sora
「...Delicious.」
She gives a thumbs-up with gusto.
all
Natsuki
「...It's soooo good～!」
Marika
「Yeah, it really is～」
Misa
「I've never had curry this delicious before! I'm very moved!」

all
Rikka
「Mhm... Pretty good.」
Touko
「Mmm... Is this one of those things where it tastes better the harder you work?」
％Ｂ
「There's still lots left, so you guys can get as many servings as you want.」
all
Natsuki
「...You just made all of us girls your enemies, you know.」
％Ｂ
「Uh... Wh-What do you mean?」
Natsuki
「Girls are born as diet warriors... Telling us to have as many servings as we want is the same thing as telling us to die.」


all
Everyone's nodding along seriously with Segawa's words for some reason.
％Ｂ
「Uhh... Well... I dunno what to say... Sorry.」
all
Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「What's wrong, Ousaka?」
Sora
「...The stars are gone.」
％Ｂ
「Ah...」
The star-shaped potatoes that Ousaka cut, as expected, had crumbled in the pot and turned into round balls.

％Ｂ
「But look, the moon carrots are still there.」
Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「Don't make that face. We can't do anything about that. It's easy for potatoes to crumble when you cook them.」

Sora
「...There are star-shaped potatoes in the curry on the box.」
She points at the roux packaging.
％Ｂ
「Oh... Well, you see... They usually boil those separately for the box art and then add them in right before they take the photo.」

Sora
「...!?」
Ousaka's head slumps down.
She's clearly crestfallen.
％Ｂ
「Honestly... Here, give me your plate.」
Sora
「...」
I grab Ousaka's plate from before her shocked eyes and open the lid to a small pot that I have beside me.

％Ｂ
「I figured this'd happen, so I boiled them separately beforehand.」

I place some star-shaped potatoes on Ousaka's plate, and add more curry on top.

％Ｂ
「Here. This is what you wanted, right?」
Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「What's wrong? Maybe you didn't want that?」
Sora
「...*shake shake*」
She places a potato on her spoon and eats it in one bite.
％Ｂ
「How is it?」
Sora
「...Mm.」
A thumbs-up.
Looks like she approves.
Sora
「...
Ryou
Mm
.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah?」
Sora
「...Thanks.」
％Ｂ
「Sure thing. You're very welcome.」
all
Marika
「Ahhh... I'm done.」
Misa
「It was absolutely delicious.」
all
Touko
「I think I might've eaten a bit too much.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「Of course we did. Look at how much we ate.」
The pot of curry and the rice cooker are both empty.
I know Narusawa and Yukimura joined in after we had planned everything, but I'm pretty sure we still made more than we needed...

all
Natsuki
「Now then, let's open up some snacks, shall we?」
％Ｂ
「What? Seriously?」
Natsuki
「They say snacks and sweets go in a separate stomach, don't they? It's one of the few absolute truths in this universe.」

...What happened to all that stuff about diet warriors?
Marika
「Wow! Okihara-san, your snacks look so tasty!」
Natsuki
「They do! And they look really high class!」
all
Misa
「I just brought what I had at home. But they are very tasty.」

Sora
「Ahh...」
Misa
「I've brought quite a lot, so please, feel free to have as much as you'd like.」

Touko
「...Is it okay for me to have some too? Even though I pretty much just walked in at the last second?」

％Ｂ
「What are you saying? No need to hesitate.」
all
Natsuki
「But still, it's not fun just eating. Why don't we play a game while we eat? With a penalty for the loser, of course.」


％Ｂ
「You sure love penalties.」
Marika
「What kind of penalty?」
Natsuki
「Tadaaa♪ Super-spicy rice crackers～♪ Whoever loses has to eat one of these super-spicy rice crackers. No water allowed, of course!」


％Ｂ
「What the... Super-spicy rice crackers after curry? ...You're a real demon.」
Marika
「Also, it feels like you brought that specifically to do this～」
Natsuki
「How about it, everyone? Wanna do it? We'll do it, right?」
Touko
「Well, it's not like I hate contests.」
all
Misa
「I would like to participate as well! It seems very fun!」

Sora
「...*nod*」
Rikka
「Fine... I assume you won't let me not participate anyway.」

all
Marika
「But what kind of game are we going to play? It'd be nice if we had some cards or something...」

％Ｂ
「Oh, we'll be fine for that. We don't need anything like that for camping games.」

all
I'm pretty familiar with these kinds of games, as someone who went camping several times as a kid.

％Ｂ
「How about we play the line-up game?」
％Ｂ
「One person plays the guesser, and they have to line up the other players in order according to whatever the rule is for that round. If the order's correct, then the guesser wins.」


％Ｂ
「The guesser can get just one hint from each of the other players. But they can't ask them for any answers, of course.」


％Ｂ
「I think it'll be easier to understand once we actually play a round. We can do a practice round, with me as the guesser, so someone else should give us a rule.」


And so we started playing the line-up game.
％Ｂ
「―And so that's how it goes. Everyone get how to play?」
I lost after everyone figured it out pretty quickly...
Though well, now everyone should be familiar with how the game's played.
Touko
「Mmm... So we need to take everyone here and line them up in order? How about birthdays, then? In order, from January to December.」

％Ｂ
「Birthdays, huh... Okay, sure.」
％Ｂ
「I'll ask everyone one question each, then. I can't ask any questions that'll directly tell me the answer. Make sure you guys don't accidentally tell me any answers, okay?」


％Ｂ
「Now then, first off... Shinozaki.」
all
Marika
「M-Me?」
％Ｂ
「Answer with either yes or no. Your birthday was... February... no, March, right? That's right, it's the same day as Girls' Festival.」


Marika
「Wow, you remembered! I'm so happy～」
Natsuki
「You have to answer with yes or no...」
Marika
「Oh, right. Y-Yes～!」
all
％Ｂ
「Segawa, you next, then. Your first name's got the kanji for summer in it, so I'm really leaning toward July or August.」


Natsuki
「Hmhmmmh, I wonder!」
％Ｂ
「Either way, that puts you after Shinozaki. So I'll go with that, and so my question is: does your birthday month have thirty-one days?」

Natsuki
「...It doesn't.」
％Ｂ
「The months after March with thirty days are April, June, September, and November. I'm thinking June or September...」

all
％Ｂ
「You next, Ousaka. I'll be honest here, you're pretty short. Which means you probably have an early birthday. Am I right?」

Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「Okay, so you're somewhere in the January through March range.」
Touko
「Wow, you're really logicking this out.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, you just kinda slowly work through it like this. The order I've got in my head so far is Ousaka, Shinozaki, and then Segawa. I think I'm about right so far.」


all
％Ｂ
「Next... Okihara-senpai... You're... Hmm... I don't really know. Your name's very ocean-themed, so I'm thinking summer...」


Misa
「Ufufu. What do you think?」
％Ｂ
「Here's my question to you, then. It's currently June. Have you already had your birthday this year?」

Misa
「It is still to come.」
％Ｂ
「Which makes me think summer for sure. I'm a bit lost on who goes where between you and Segawa... so I'll just shelve that one for now.」


all
％Ｂ
「You next, Narusawa. Hmm... Thinking about what I know about you... Since you're a pianist... Hmm.」

Rikka
「Do pianists have some specific birthday in your mind?」
％Ｂ
「No... Not really.」
Rikka
「What?」
％Ｂ
「I just have to think of some place to find hints from.」

％Ｂ
「Oh... I know. You like rainy days?」
Rikka
「...I don't really hate them.」
％Ｂ
「Fufufu. You've dug your own grave. You were born during the rainy season, weren't you? So you're June!」


Rikka
「...!? I-I just said I like rain... That's not a legitimate reason for you to say that!」

Touko
「You know, you getting that defensive is pretty much just telling him he's right.」

Rikka
「Uuuh... What else am I supposed to say?」
all
Touko
「Well, I'll still answer your question without so much as batting an eye. Go on, any question you'd like.」

％Ｂ
「You're winter.」
Touko
「Wait a second, isn't that a bit too careless? Is that because of the "snow" kanji in Yukimura? You know that'd mean that my entire family was born in winter, right?」


％Ｂ
「That's part of it, but there's your first name, Touko, too. If it's got the kanji for transparency in it, I'm thinking winter.」

all
％Ｂ
「And so, from my predictions, Okihara-senpai is summer, Narusawa is June, Yukimura is winter. So if I add these to my guesses from earlier... Let's see...」


％Ｂ
「From earliest to latest, Ousaka, Shinozaki, Narusawa, Segawa, Okihara-senpai, Yukimura... I think. There's a chance I've got Segawa and Okihara-senpai reversed, but I guess it's something like that? How'd I do?」


Marika
「Time to reveal the correct answer, then. Let's each say our birthdays, in the order that you just said. Which I guess means you start, Ousaka-san.」


all
Sora
「...January 5th.」
％Ｂ
「Whoa! I was right!」
Even I'm surprised at how on the mark I was.
all
Marika
「I'm next. I'm March 3rd, which is the day of the Girls' Festival, so you're right so far. Narusawa-san, you're next. Is it really June?」

all
Rikka
「...It's June 29th.」
％Ｂ
「That's right in the middle of the rainy season! I'm starting to get a little scared of my own ability.」

Rikka
「It may be a coincidence, but I'll still give you that one.」
all
Marika
「Segawa-san was next... but this was where you were least confident, right? Let's ask Yukimura-san first, then. Yukimura-san, were you born in the winter?」


all
Touko
「December 10th. You really got it.」
％Ｂ
「All right!」
I gotta say, I'm really amazing!
Touko
「I'm surprised you got so many right.」
％Ｂ
「Well, it's a relatively easy rule. So if I get Segawa and Okihara-senpai's order right, then I win. I'm sure that Segawa's in the summer, so it's all up to Senpai's birthday.」


all
Marika
「Then Okihara-san, when is your birthday?」
all
Misa
「My birthday is July 24th.」
％Ｂ
「Yes! I got it! I knew it was in the summer!」
Misa
「Yes. I have been told by my parents that the kanji for "beautiful sands" that make up my name were picked with summer beaches in mind. I'm very impressed!」


all
Marika
「It's good that you got it right, but isn't July 24th a bit on the edge～?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. It's a bet from this point on. I can only hope that Segawa's birthday's somewhere near the end of July...」

Marika
「So then, Segawa-san, the correct answer is?」
all
Natsuki
「My birthday is...」
Natsuki
「November 30th!」
％Ｂ
「Wha... You, what the...」
Rikka
「It's not even in summer. That's deep in autumn.」
Touko
「More like winter. It's close to mine.」
％Ｂ
「Why's that your name when you were born in November?」
Natsuki
「Not like I was the one who picked my name. Tell that to my parents.」

all
Misa
「Now, now. This game is currently about guessing birthdays. Names don't matter.」

Marika
「That's right. Unfortunately, 
Hino-kun, 
 
your guess was wrong～」

But still, I'm glad I managed to get more right than I expected.
I think that went pretty well for a practice round―

all
Natsuki
「Okay, now then, time for the penalty～!」
％Ｂ
「Wha...!? No, that was a practice round just now!」
Natsuki
「What are you complaining for? I said there was a penalty if you lost, didn't I? It may have been practice, but it was still a game!」


Touko
「How about we call it practice for the penalty?」
％Ｂ
「That means I still have to eat it! Kh... Fine... I'll do it!」

It's just one rice cracker.
Super spicy or not, it's just one―
all
％Ｂ
「Crunch... Crunch, crunch...」
％Ｂ
「...」
Marika
「H-Huh? What's wrong～?」
％Ｂ
「Hgh... ghh... Nghh... Hghhhhhh...!?」
Rikka
「It kind of looks like he's in intense pain.」
％Ｂ
「Ho...Hoooootttt! Wh-What the hell is this!? It's so hot! This is way too hot! It's soooo hot!」


all
Natsuki
「I told you it was a super-spicy rice cracker.」
％Ｂ
「I-I didn't think it'd be this hot! W-Water! Gimme water!」

Touko
「Oh? I thought water wasn't allowed.」
％Ｂ
「Wha... No, seriously! Seriously, please! Senpai! Ousaka!」

all
Misa
「Unfortunately, those were the rules. Ufufu.」
Sora
「...Follow the rules.」
％Ｂ
「Uuuhh... You're all demons...」
all
Natsuki
「Anyway, we've figured out how to play. Let's all try it then. We'll decide the guesser with rock-paper-scissors.」


all
％Ｂ & Sora & Marika & Natsuki & Misa & Rikka & Touko
「Rock! Paper... Scissors!」
all
％Ｂ
「What!? Me again!?」
Marika
「Umm... I'm sorry...」
Misa
「Please do your best.」
all
Touko
「A second super-spicy's gonna be crazy. I'm bad with spicy stuff.」
Rikka
「My condolences.」
Sora
「...Looks hot.」
％Ｂ
「Kh... Y-You don't know for sure yet that I'm gonna lose!」
all
All I have to do is get it right!
This time I'll get it right, and avoid that rice cracker!
Natsuki
「Okay, then the next rule is... I know. How about you guess our heights? Come on, everyone, crouch down.」

Natsuki
「We'll stand up one at a time, so that can be your hint.」

Height order, huh.
Natsuki
「You can choose the order we stand up in.」
％Ｂ
「All right... Then Senpai, you first.」
all
Misa
「Okay.」
I stare intently at her once she stands up.
Misa
「It's strangely exciting, even though all I'm doing is standing.」
％Ｂ
「Thank you very much. Yukimura, you next.」
all
Touko
「Yes, yes.」
％Ｂ
「Then, Segawa.」
all
Natsuki
「Got iiit.」
％Ｂ
「Shinozaki, you next.」
all
Marika
「Okaaay.」
％Ｂ
「Now, Narusawa.」
all
Rikka
「...Is this fine?」
％Ｂ
「Hm... I see...」
all
I think I've got a vague idea.
Marika
「Um... There's still someone who hasn't stood up yet, you know.」
％Ｂ
「Huh? Yeah, but Ousaka's...」
Sora
「...」
Her eyes are just begging me to ask her to stand up.
％Ｂ
「Then... Ousaka.」
Sora
「...Okay.」
Uh huh... Yeah, you're definitely at one end of the scale.
Though I already knew that...
all
Natsuki
「Now then, let's have you line us up in order.」
％Ｂ
「Okay... I'll start, then.」
all
I'm pretty sure of a few of the spots.
I can suss things out more or less by dividing the group into smaller people and bigger people.

But the ones I'm not sure about...
Are Segawa and Yukimura.
％Ｂ
「Which one's taller between Segawa and Yukimura?」
％Ｂ
「Segawa's the problematic one again...」
all
Natsuki
「Who do you think you're calling problematic? How rude.」
％Ｂ
「I can't really tell who's bigger between you and Yukimura.」
Natsuki
「If we're talking boobs, then I think I'm bigger.」
Touko
「You think so? I think I'm the bigger one.」
Natsuki
「How about we have 
Hino 
him 
guess, then?」
％Ｂ
「Excuse me!?」
Touko
「That sounds fun. Okay, let's do that.」
％Ｂ
「Wait, come on... Gimme a break.」
Playing the line-up game with boob sizes is just gonna get me called a freak regardless of whether I get it right or not!

％Ｂ
「You guys can do that privately later...」
all
Rikka
「So who is it, then? What order would you put Segawa-san and Yukimura-san in?」

％Ｂ
「Well, let's see...」
Segawa's bigger.
Yukimura's bigger.
％Ｂ
「I'm pretty sure Segawa was the bigger one...」
all
Natsuki
「Huh? My boobs?」
％Ｂ
「I'm talking about your freakin' height! I don't care about your boobs!」

Natsuki
「You should know, since you've touched them before.」
Marika
「Huh? ...I-I wonder what that's supposed to mean?」
％Ｂ
「H-Hey, Segawa! And Shinozaki, don't get interested in that!」

Marika
「Uuuh... Tell me later, okay～」
％Ｂ
「Hmm... But I also feel like Yukimura's slightly bigger too...」

all
Touko
「See? He says my boobs are bigger.」
％Ｂ
「...No, I'm talking about your height.」
Could we stop talking about boobs already?
all
％Ｂ
「Anyway, my guess is something like this!」
all
Marika
「Let's say the correct answers in order again, then. Starting with Ousaka-san.」

Sora
「...152 centimeters.」
Yeah, she's tiny.
Though I guess she's still over 150.
Marika
「I'm 156 centimeters. Next is... Narusawa-san.」

Rikka
「I'm 167 centimeters.」
Marika
「You're so big～ I'm so jealous～」
Rikka
「Are you? There's nothing good about it, you know.」
Marika
「That's just something you can say because you're big～ Small people like Ousaka-san and me are sensitive about it...」

Sora
「...*nod*」
Natsuki
「But aren't your boobs bigger than Rikka's, Marika?」

Marika
「Y-You think so～? But there's nothing good about them being big...」

Rikka
「...That's just something you can say because you're bigger. You people wouldn't know how I feel.」

Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「Excuse me... Could we please get back to the correct answers?」
I don't really have a place in a conversation that keeps going back to talking about boobs.

all
Misa
「I am 164 centimeters.」
Marika
「Ahhh～ I knew it, you're over 160 too～ I'm so jealous... and you have big boobs, too...」

Just stop it with the boob talk already.
all
Natsuki
「It looks like it's a match between us now.」
Touko
「You're on, Camera-chan.」
％Ｂ
「No, it's actually you guys versus me here...」
Natsuki
「Let's say our heights at the same time, then.」
Touko
「Sounds good. How about on the count of three?」
Natsuki
「Sure. Here we go, then. One, two... three!」
Natsuki & Touko
「160 centimeters! Huh? We're the same?」
Marika
「You two are both exactly the same?」
Natsuki
「I'm 160.3 centimeters.」
Touko
「I'm 160.3 centimeters too.」
Marika
「So you are the same～」
Rikka
「So what happens now, then?」
Misa
「
Ryousuke-san 
He 
predicted that one would be larger than the other, so...」

Marika
「That means he was wrong then, right?」
％Ｂ
「No, wait! Isn't them having the same height cheating?」
Natsuki
「It's not cheating. The possibility was there all along, wasn't it?」

Touko
「That's right. It's your loss because you didn't consider that possibility.」
Natsuki
「Which means it's time for the second penalty gaaame!」
Touko
「Yaaay♪」
％Ｂ
「Fuooooooooohhh!? Seriously!?」
A double dose of the super-spicy rice cracker!? Are you kidding me!?
％Ｂ
「Kh... Fine, I'll eat it! I'll eat it all right!」
all
Marika
「Uh, um... Maybe you shouldn't force yourself?」
all
％Ｂ
「N-No... Rules are rules! I said I'll eat it, so I'll eat it!」

％Ｂ
「Hargh... Crunch...」
％Ｂ
「Gmnhhh!?」
It's still so hoooooottt!
％Ｂ
「D-Done...」
Misa
「It's heroic, in a way.」
Touko
「Mmm, you're definitely a boy.」
Rikka
「This is stupid.」
all
Marika
「H-Hey... Why don't we play a different game? Let's play a game where someone wins, instead of one where it's just one person who loses.」


Marika
「And we can stop with the penalty games, and make it so whoever wins gets to keep all of one type of snack to themselves～?」

Misa
「Y-Yes, that does sound nice... I would also prefer we went with Marika-san's suggestion.」
all
Touko
「It's not as thrilling, but that might be more fun.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「...Why didn't we just do that from the start, then?」
all
Rikka
「You were the one who suggested the line-up game in the first place.」

％Ｂ
「I did, but...」
％Ｂ
「Let's see... How about Indian drawings, then?」
all
Touko
「What's that? I've heard of Indian poker.」
％Ｂ
「It's pretty much that, but with drawings. We pick a theme, and draw pictures that fit that theme. We shuffle them and hand them out.」


％Ｂ
「We make sure we don't see what we've been given, and stick them on our foreheads. And then we each ask each other questions about our own drawings. You have to try to guess what your drawing is based on those answers.」


Touko
「Huh, that sounds fun.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, but does anyone have some pens and paper?」
all
Misa
「I have a notebook for observations. I also have several colored pens and highlighters.」

％Ｂ
「Could we borrow those, then?」
Misa
「Of course. You may rip sheets out of the notebook as well.」
all
I grab the pens and paper from Okihara-senpai and hand them out to everyone.
％Ｂ
「So as an additional rule, let's say you can only ask each person one question. You can ask them all the same question, or you can ask them all different questions.」


％Ｂ
「No asking for what the answer is, of course, and we all need to make sure we don't accidentally give away the answer when we respond.」

Natsuki
「And whoever guesses wrong gets a penalty.」
％Ｂ
「Wha... Again!? I thought whoever wins gets to keep some snacks to themselves!?」

Natsuki
「But we have super-spicy rice crackers left over. It'd be a waste to not eat them, so let's say the people who guess wrong in this game have to finish the bag.」


Touko
「Agh, I don't want to lose... though the risk might make it more fun.」

Misa
「I'm very nervous... but also very excited.」
Rikka
「Those are really spicy, aren't they?」
Natsuki
「You there, you should suck it up and do it, since you already decided to!」
Rikka
「I never decided to...」
Misa
「What will the theme be?」
％Ｂ
「Then... how about animals?」
all
Marika
「Animals, huh... Mmm, what should I draw～」
％Ｂ
「Well, all that matters is that we can tell what animal it is. It'd be kinda bad if whoever answers your questions doesn't actually know what the answer is.」


all
And so first we all need to draw.
I draw a cow.
I've never been terrible at drawing.
I personally think it actually came out pretty nicely.
％Ｂ
「Hmm... Okay. Everyone done?」
Natsuki
「I guess this is good enough.」
all
Marika
「Auuuh... It doesn't look like what I wanted at aaall...」
all
Misa
「I am done.」
all
Sora
「...Finished.」
all
Touko
「Ahaha... W-Well... All that matters is that you can tell what it is, right?」
all
Rikka
「...I'm done.」
％Ｂ
「Then everyone, flip them over so we can't see what you drew, and I'll take them.」
all
I shuffle the sheets and hand them back out.
％Ｂ
「Let's all stick the paper to our foreheads on the count of three.」
％Ｂ
「Everyone ready? Then―」
％Ｂ & Sora & Marika & Natsuki & Misa & Rikka & Touko
「One, two... three!」
We all bring the paper to our foreheads.
Natsuki
「Pff... Khhh...」
Marika
「Wow...」
Sora
「...」
Misa
「Ufufu.」
Touko
「Oh geez...」
Rikka
「...Hmm.」
％Ｂ
「Hm.」
all
I can more or less make a few inferences about what my drawing is already.

If I hadn't been able to spot the cow I drew, then that would mean that my drawing is the cow.

But unfortunately, Segawa's got the cow.
all
And next, Okihara-senpai's most likely drawn her usual favorite. Some kind of marine animal.\n\r

If there were no one here with a fish or something similar...
...But Ousaka's got a fish.
A strangely realistic one, too. Like, it's too well drawn...
So that has to be what Okihara-senpai drew.
all
Which means that my drawing was done by someone other than Okihara-senpai or me, which narrows it down to five people...

all
％Ｂ
「Okay, so we can each ask questions about what animal we've got. Let's go clockwise, starting with Shinozaki.」

Rikka
「So what kind of questions are we even supposed to ask?」
％Ｂ
「Like what you'd think if you saw that animal in real life, or if it's one you could find around here... Well, thinking of good questions is also part of the game.」

Rikka
「So the questioner needs to think carefully about their questions, too.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, but no questions about what they sound like. That makes it too easy. You can ask if they make noise or not, though.」


all
Marika
「Then... Here I go. Umm... Segawa-san. Is my animal one that's often kept in normal households?」


Natsuki
「Yeah. I think it is.」
％Ｂ
「That really narrowed things down right off the bat.」
Marika
「Ousaka-san, do you, or anyone in your neighborhood, keep one of these animals?」

Sora
「...My next-door neighbors do.」
Marika
「Then Okihara-san! Do you normally see people walking this animal around town?」

Misa
「I do not believe people usually walk that animal.」
Marika
「Yay! I know what it is already!」
％Ｂ
「I bet...」
That answer might've been a bit of a dead giveaway.
Marika
「Then Narusawa-san, does this animal bond well with people?」
Rikka
「I think so, yes.」
Marika
「Yukimura-san, is this animal furry?」
Touko
「There are ones that are fluffy and ones that aren't, but yeah, mostly.」

Marika
「Hehe. Then, 
Hino-kun. 
last question... 
Does this animal have a noise that it makes?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah... It does.」
Marika
「Okay, that's perfect! I know what it is for sure!」
％Ｂ
「Don't say what you think it is yet. We'll all do it together at the end. Okay then, Segawa, you're next.」

all
Natsuki
「Uhh...」
all
They all go around the circle asking questions, and they all come to their respective conclusions about their animal.

It's finally my turn.
％Ｂ
「Okay, my turn, then. First off, Shinozaki, does this animal have a cry?」
Marika
「Um... It does... maybe～?」
Wait, what?
Marika
「It might cry like with tears, but it doesn't really have a call or anything... Oh, but it can kinda yell, so... Mmm...」


Wh-What?
What kinda animal makes you that hesitant about your answer?
all
％Ｂ
「Th-Then, Ousaka. Do people keep this animal as a pet?」
Sora
「...Can you even?」
％Ｂ
「Wha?」
Sora
「Some places might have it on display...」
Have it on display?
Like, stuffed and mounted?
Is it some kind of wild beast?
all
％Ｂ
「Okihara-senpai... Does this animal attack people?」
Misa
「I've never heard of such a thing. In fact, it may be an animal that makes people happy.」

Makes people happy?
So it's not a beastlike animal, then?
What is it?
all
％Ｂ
「Uhh... Narusawa, do you think you could eat this animal's meat?」
Rikka
「Don't ask something so scary. There's no way I could.」
％Ｂ
「Uh... Did I say something scary?」
So it's not an animal you eat the meat of, then.
I was thinking maybe a bear or wild boar, but if you can't eat its meat...

all
％Ｂ
「So this next one's the last question... Yukimura. If you were to give this animal a nickname, what would it be?」

Touko
「Well... That's a tough question...」
％Ｂ
「No, it's just a hypothetical. What nickname would you give it, hypothetically?」

Touko
「Yeah, but I think it's already got a name...」
％Ｂ
「Excuse me?」
It's already got a name?
Touko
「Well, if I had to think of one... Wolfgang.」
％Ｂ
「...What on earth is that supposed to mean?」
Touko
「Aghhh, no more! I'll end up giving away the answer if I say any more!」
all
It cries, people don't keep it as a pet, it makes people happy, you can't eat its meat, and it's a "Wolfgang"...

I have noooo idea what it could be!
Natsuki
「Let's see what we think our answers are, then. Marika, you first.」
all
Marika
「Mine is... a cat!」
She checks the drawing on her forehead.
Marika
「I did it! I got it right!」
all
Natsuki
「Yeah, yours was easy too. I'm next. It's gotta be a cow, right?」

Natsuki
「I'm riiight! Hey, who drew this? It's actually pretty good.」
％Ｂ
「I did.」
Natsuki
「What? Seriously? This is great. You could probably join the art club at this rate.」

Marika
「He's always been good with his hands!」
all
Touko
「Huh. Guess you can't judge a book by its cover.」
Rikka
「Hmm... So you're talented at drawing?」
all
Misa
「I think it's very well drawn.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
I'm a little happy at the unexpected praise...
all
...Wait, no. I don't have the time for that.
I still have absolutely no idea what my animal is.
I'll have to face those super-spicy rice crackers again if I don't figure it out.
I need to get it right...
Touko
「Mine's a giraffe, right? It has to be!」
Touko
「Huh? Um... Is this a giraffe? Was I wrong? Is it a horse? An alpaca? Did I get it wrong?」

Marika
「It... is a giraffe... It's supposed to be... It might not look like one... I'm sorry...」

Touko
「Oh... N-No, it does! It's definitely a giraffe! Phew... I'm glad I got it right!」


all
Sora
「Fish. Probably tuna.」
all
Misa
「I think mine is a dove!」
all
Rikka
「Mine's a rabbit.」
all
All of them say their guesses, and they're all correct.
Now if I get mine right, then this round's a wash...
Natsuki
「Everyone's been right so far. You're last
, Hino

!」
％Ｂ
「R-Right...」
all
Crap...
I still have no idea what it is!
What on earth is Wolfgang supposed to be!?
Panda
A cryptid
Mozart
％Ｂ
「Mine is... It-It's a panda!」
It cries tears, it can't be a pet, it makes people happy, you can't eat it, and it's a "Wolfgang"...

It's gotta be a panda!
...Or more like that's the only thing that comes to mind.
Marika
「Then, please take a look at the answer.」
all
I take a look at the drawing on my forehead.
It cries, it can't be a pet, it makes people happy, you can't eat it, and it's a "Wolfgang"...

That has to be some kind of cryptid or something...
％Ｂ
「The only answer that comes to mind's some kinda cryptid...」
Touko
「How about you take a look?」
all
I hesitantly take a look.
It's an unusually realistic drawing of―
％Ｂ
「Wait. Who the heck is this?」
Rikka
「It's Mozart. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.」
％Ｂ
「It's a freakin' person!?」
Rikka
「I drew it because you said any animal was fine. Humans are animals too, aren't they?」

％Ｂ
「You don't need to get all clever for a game like this!」
Plus, this drawing's ridiculously good!
I've seen something like this framed up on the wall of a music classroom!
all
Natsuki
「Well anyway, you're the only one who got it wrong, so you're doing the penalty game.」

％Ｂ
「No, seriously, this isn't fair, this isn't okay...」
Natsuki
「Now then, time for you to chow down on these super-spicy rice crackers!」
...Are you trying to kill me?
％Ｂ
「And what the heck's up with the name "Wolfgang"? Not like it's a person or―」
...Wait a second.
It's not a person... or is it?
Maybe the person who drew this got clever with it and went with the "humans are animals too" shtick?

And if anyone here would do that, it'd be...
Rikka
「...」
Oh. Did she look away just now?
Wait a second, is Narusawa the one who...?
all
Which means that it's a human that Narusawa would draw, and it's a "Wolfgang" that Yukimura would know...

Narusawa plays piano, so if she's gonna draw a "Wolfgang"... Uhh, I'm pretty sure it was...

％Ｂ
「Wolfgang... Amadeus... Mozart!」
Rikka
「...What!?」
all
I grin at her and check the drawing on my forehead.
It's an unusually realistic drawing of―
％Ｂ
「The heck? This is way too well drawn. It's like you grabbed a portrait off the wall of a music classroom or something...」
Rikka
「How did you know?」
％Ｂ
「I got lots of hints. "Wolfgang" was the biggest one.」
Rikka
「So you knew Mozart's full name?」
％Ｂ
「I'm not stupid. I listen to classical music every now and then, you know. Though it's just that my dad makes me listen to it with him, 'cause he likes it.」

Rikka
「Huh... I see... That's unexpected.」
％Ｂ
「Well anyway, we all guessed right, so I guess that means no penalty.」

all
Natsuki
「Then, as a prize for 
Hino-kun 
you 
for answering that so well, a bag of super-spicy rice crackers!」

％Ｂ
「Yaaay, awesome!」
％Ｂ
「Wait, I don't want that!」
％Ｂ
「Hmm... It's pretty late. We should start packing up.」
Marika
「What? Is it time to go already～?」
Sora
「...The stars aren't out yet.」
％Ｂ
「You were planning on stargazing too? We can't stay out too late, can we?」

all
Misa
「It's unfortunate, but it is about time for us to leave.」
Rikka
「Sigh... I'm all covered in sweat.」
all
Natsuki
「If that's the case, then let's go to the hot springs!」
％Ｂ
「What? Hot springs?」
Natsuki
「This place has a hot spring. It's an incredible 300 yen for students to go! There's even an open-air bath!」


％Ｂ
「Seriously!?」
First the water pipes and bathroom, and now there's even a hot spring...
Touko
「But I didn't bring a change of clothes.」
Natsuki
「Well, you'll just have to go without that. Don't you think you'll feel better going home even if it's just washing your sweat away?」


Rikka
「...I'll go. I'll feel all sticky and gross otherwise. And my hair smells like curry.」


all
Misa
「That sounds very fun! I will also join you.」
Sora
「...Agreed.」
all
Natsuki
「Well? We at least have time to go to the hot springs, don't we?」
％Ｂ
「Well... Yeah, I guess it's fine. All right, then let's all go to the hot springs!」

all
Sora & Marika & Natsuki & Misa & Rikka & Touko
「Yeah!」
％Ｂ
「Phew...」
I stretch out as far as I can in the hot water.
％Ｂ
「Fuaaah... Man, this is awesome.」
I can't believe this campground even has something like this... and it's only 300 yen, too.\n\r

It's even cheaper than going to a bathhouse downtown.
％Ｂ
「Plus, I've got the whole place to myself.」
I'm the only one in the men's bath.
Local residents apparently come here by bus and car in the later hours.

％Ｂ
「And I get why. It's cheap, and it's way more comfortable.」

I'd wanna come here again when I have the time.
％Ｂ
「Khh... Hot springs are the best!」
Rikka
『Hey... Did you hear a voice just now?』
％Ｂ
「Hm...?」
Touko
『You sure you didn't just imagine it?』
Rikka
『I wonder... Well, never mind if that's the case.』
It's Narusawa and Yukimura...
I guess I can hear people talking in the women's bath from here.
Marika
『Wow, it's pretty big～』
Natsuki
『Huh, only 300 yen for this? Totally okay with me.』
Touko
『It seems like we're the only ones here. I guess this place isn't that popular?』

Marika
『Wawah, S-Senpai, you need to hide yourself a little more～』
Misa
『Y-Yes, but the rental towels are so small...』
Touko
『You didn't pick a size L?』
Misa
『No... I only realized after the fact...』
Sora
『...』
Marika
『D-Don't worry. You can be like her once you get bigger, Ousaka-san... Okay?』

％Ｂ
「...」
...I feel like I'm overhearing a conversation I shouldn't be able to hear.
It's pretty much like I'm eavesdropping at this rate.
％Ｂ
「I know. There's supposed to be an open-air bath here, right? I'll go over there...」

Looks like that door in the bath leads there.
I get up out of the bath and walk toward the door.
％Ｂ
「Huh? It's locked?」
That's weird.
I heard the open-air bath was usable...
％Ｂ
「Hm? There's a key on the ground here...」
Is it...?
I try slotting it into the keyhole of the door to the open-air bath.
％Ｂ
「Oh... It opened.」
The door opens to reveal the open-air bath.
It's pretty big, too. And what's more, it's empty.
％Ｂ
「Huh... I guess there was a mixup, and someone locked that door by accident?」
Not like there's anyone other than me here, so I doubt it'll be an issue if I go in.
％Ｂ
「There we go... Open air, yeah.」
％Ｂ
「Fuaaah... Normal baths are great and all, but open-air baths are the best part of hot springs.」

％Ｂ
「Sitting in a hot spring, watching the sun set... Man, it's so relaxing...」
Natsuki
「Open-air baths are usually pretty small, but this one's actually pretty big.」

％Ｂ
「Uh...」
So I can hear the women's bath here, too?
And I feel like it's even louder than before...
_00cutinBS
Marika
「But is it okay for it to be this big? I feel like they won't have room for the men's bath at this rate.」

％Ｂ
「...!?」
W-Wait a second!
Why are Shinozaki and the others here!?
_00cutinBS
Touko
「Don't the men's baths have their own open-air bath?」
I-Is this not the men's bath's open-air bath!?
_00cutinBS
Misa
「I inquired about it at the front desk. It appears the open-air bath here is unisex.」
％Ｂ
「...!?」
_00cutinBS
Rikka
「What? Do you mean this is mixed bathing!? Wait, so is he going to come in here too!?」

_00cutinBS
Touko
「There's no way.」
_00cutinBS
Misa
「Indeed. This open-air bath is apparently used in shifts, and it is currently a women-only bath. I was told that the door would be locked from the men's side, so there is no need to worry.」


S-So that's why the door was locked!
Which means that I'm the intruder in this bath... Crap... I'll have no excuse if they spot me...

_00cutinBS
_00cutinBS
_00cutinBS
_00cutinBS
Anyway, I need to hide until they leave!
％Ｂ
「...」
I move behind the rocks, making sure to not make any sound.

Sora
「...」
Misa
「Is something the matter, Sora-san? You've seemed quite glum for a while now.」

Marika
「Are you dizzy from the bath?」
Sora
「...*shake shake*... Everyone has big boobs.」
all
Touko
「Oh, are we talking about boobs? Nah, mine aren't that big.」

Misa
「But, it is as Sora-san says. Yours are all quite large.」

Rikka
「...You're the person I least want to hear that from.」
Touko
「Hey, wanna play the line-up game? The rule is boob size.」

all
Natsuki
「Oh? Should I consider that you challenging me?」

Touko
「Let's settle things from earlier today, Camera-chan.」
Natsuki
「You're on!」
all
...Things have gotten crazy.
I really can't let myself be seen now...
Marika
「What bra size are you, Okihara-san?」
Misa
「Oh, umm... I am an 88E.」
Marika
「E!」
Natsuki
「E?」
Touko
「E...」
E!
Wait. What are we all making that sound for? Not like we're some evil Kamen Rider organization or something...

Touko
「A-Anyway, looks like we know who's the biggest.」
Natsuki
「I'll have to acknowledge that...」
Misa
「Fufu... Th-Thank you very much. What is yours, Marika-san?」

all
Marika
「U-Ummm... I'm an 84C～」
Touko
「Hmhmh!」
Natsuki
「I won!」
Rikka
「...You're not lying, are you?」
Marika
「I-I'm not～ ...It-It's true, okay...?」
Rikka
「Well, fine... Also, this isn't really a line-up game at this point.」


Touko
「That's true.」
all
Natsuki
「Then Misa-san, you decide on the order. Use your judgment as the Boobs Queen.」

The Boobs Queen...
...I'm starting to get a bit excited!
all
Misa
「I wouldn't call myself a queen... However, though it may be presumptuous of me, I will be taking a look at all of you. Could you all please stand?」


Natsuki
「We're standing? W-Well... Okay, sure. Everyone else, stand up.」

all
Right now, on the other side of these rocks, is a dazzling display of boobs-versus-boobs action... Khh... I wanna look too!

Misa
「Hm... I see. Now then, I will be making my predictions based on my own judgments.」

Misa
「The smallest is... I'm very sorry. Sora-san.」
Sora
「...」
Yeah. Saw that coming.
Now imagine if Ousaka turned out to have been hiding huge boobs. That'd have been a real twist.
Misa
「Next... is... Rikka-san.」
Oh... Guess my next guess was right too?
Rikka
「...It's fine... I already knew it...」
Misa
「And Marika-san would be next.」
Marika
「I thought so... I can tell Segawa-san's and Yukimura-san's are bigger just by looking.」

all
Misa
「You remaining two are the difficult ones. It is difficult to place one over the other just by looking...」

Hm... I've touched Segawa's boobs before. I remember them being real soft...

So I guess Yukimura's are about the same as Segawa...
Does having the same height means they have the same proportions too?
Misa
「Let's see... Hmm～ ...To be truthful, it's difficult to judge just from looking. May I touch them a little?」

Wh-What!?
Touko
「Y-You're... going to touch? Uhh... Well, whatever. Not like it'll cost me anything.」

Natsuki
「If Touko's fine with it, then I am too. But you'll have to let me touch yours later in exchange, Misa-san.」

all
Misa
「Now then, Yukimura-san, if you'll excuse me first. Hm... I see... I see～」

Wh-What does she see?
all
Misa
「And next, Natsuki-san... Yes, yes... I see, I see～」

all
Natsuki
「And now it's my turn to touch yours, Misa-san.」
Touko
「Oh, can I touch too?」
Marika
「Um... Me too, then.」
Rikka
「...I would also like to.」
all
Natsuki
「Agh, what the heck!? They're sooo soft!」
Marika
「They are... They're so squishy.」
Touko
「I could sleep like a baby with these boobs as my pillow.」
Rikka
「...I don't know if I could see the keys when I play if they were this big.」
Misa
「U-Um... Please, everyone... If you could do that in moderation...」
Natsuki
「Sora, you should touch too. The boob luck might rub off on you.」

Sora
「...*nod*」
Misa
「Aahn... S-Sora-san, you too...!?」
Sora
「...Marshmallows.」
Misa
「P-Please, if you could... stop now...」
all
Natsuki
「Oh man, we got to touch something real nice.」
Touko
「I think I can see why guys are so obsessed with boobs now.」
all
Marika
「Yup, yup. Me too. I want to touch them forever.」
Rikka
「...So what's the order in the end?」
all
Natsuki
「Oh, right. What is it, Misa-san?」
Touko
「Who was bigger between me and Camera-chan?」
Misa
「Let me see... From what I can tell, it must be―」
It must be...?
Misa
「I believe the two of you are the same.」
Natsuki
「Oh, come on now. Just because we're the same height doesn't automatically mean our boobs are the same size too.」

Touko
「Yeah, that'd be overkill.」
Misa
「Yes, but after looking at them and actually touching them, I do not believe them to be significantly different.」

Misa
「And so, my order is Sora-san, Rikka-san, Marika-san, Natsuki-san tied with Touko-san, and lastly me.」


all
Marika
「Let's reveal the correct answers, then. Okihara-san, you're the largest with a size 88E, right? What about you, Ousaka-san?」

all
Sora
「...76...A.」
Just as small as her height, huh.
But don't you worry, Ousaka.
You'll grow soon enough!
all
Marika
「What about you, Narusawa?」
Rikka
「...82B. Is there an issue?」
No one said there was an issue, Narusawa...
But I get why you're so defensive.
It's just the way things are... The ones around you are just too big.
all
Marika
「I'm an 84C, so it's as you've guessed so far, Okihara-san.」

Marika
「The issue is these two...」
all
Touko
「Wanna go on the count of three again?」
Natsuki
「Sounds good to me. Okay then, one, two... three!」
Natsuki & Touko
「88 centimeters! D! What? Seriously!?」
Marika
「They're exactly the same again...」
Natsuki
「I'm an 88D.」
Touko
「I'm also an 88-centimeter D-cup.」
Marika
「Yeah, you're really the same... You got it right, Okihara-san.」
Misa
「Ufufu. Thank you very much.」
The Boobs Queen sure is impressive...
A perfect analysis.
Natsuki
「I can't believe we're even the same bust size.」
Touko
「So we'll call it a draw for now.」
Natsuki
「Let's do that. We can do this again another time.」
Touko
「You're on.」
Mmm, what a nice story.
But still... they're still in the bath?
I wish they'd start getting out already.
I feel like I might pass out if I stay here for too long...
Marika
「Hauh... I guess I've still got a long way to go～」
Natsuki
「What are you talking about? Size is important, but yours are really nicely shaped and cute.」

Natsuki
「I wonder who's gonna be the lucky guy that gets to squeeze theeese!」
Marika
「Aah!? H-Hey, wait, Segawa-san!?」
Natsuki
「So is it gonna be 
Hino
him
?」
％Ｂ
「...!?」
M-Me!?
Rikka
「What? ...A-Are you two like that?」
Marika
「N-No, we're not... That's not what we're like!」
Touko
「Huh, so you like boys like that, Flower-chan? Well, I can't say I don't understand.」

all
Natsuki
「Whoa there, now that's a line I can't just ignore! So Touko, does that mean you like his type too?」

Touko
「Mmm, I dunno. I don't think he's a bad guy.」
Natsuki
「So then you think you might end up going for him, if the situation's right?」
Touko
「Ahaha. No comment.」
No way... Am I actually pretty popular?
Natsuki
「Oh my, a rival for Marika! What's gonna happen now!?」

Marika
「It-It's not... like I'm...」
Natsuki
「Don't be so passive. Or else he might actually get snatched away from you, you know!」


Touko
「Well, what about you, Camera-chan?」
Natsuki
「Me? Let's see, for me... Well for me, a guy would definitely need to be able to keep up with my pace.」


So I'd have to keep up with Segawa's pace...
That sounds pretty tough...
Though it sounds fun too.
Natsuki
「All right, let's take this opportunity to learn about everyone's preferences for guys!」

Touko
「Ahaha, that's a pretty girly conversation topic.」
all
Natsuki
「Rikka! What kinda guys do you like?」
Rikka
「Wh-Why do I have to answer that question?」
Natsuki
「It's fine, isn't it? So does it have to be someone who's involved with music?」
Rikka
「...Not really... I don't care about that. It's not like music tells you anything about what someone's like anyway.」

Rikka
「If I had to say, it'd be someone who approves of me the way I am... I guess.」
Natsuki
「So someone who's broad-minded? That's a pretty mature opinion. Misa-san, you next.」


all
Misa
「Um? ...Me? Let me see... Someone who's understanding... Is that a satisfactory answer?」

Natsuki
「Do you mean understanding about you?」
Misa
「Myself, but also my interests and research. It would be nice if there were someone who could understand those parts of me... is what I think occasionally.」


Natsuki
「That was a pretty serious answer... Lastly, the school's representative out-of-it girl, Ousaka Sora! And your preferred kind of guy is!?」


all
Sora
「...Someone who likes stars.」
Natsuki
「Your big sister's a little relieved.」
...Same here.
all
％Ｂ
「...More importantly, I'm kinda at my limit here...」
I feel like I seriously might keel over if they don't leave soon...

Marika
「Oh, where are you going, Ousaka-san?」
Sora
「...It's hot, so I'm getting out.」
all
Rikka
「I'm getting out too.」

Misa
「Yes, we do need to start preparing to leave soon.」
all
Touko
「This place is pretty nice. I might wanna come again.」
Natsuki
「We should all come again sometime, then. We'll stay the night next time.」
all
Marika
「Oh, that sounds nice～ I want to try sleeping in a sleeping bag and stuff.」
all
％Ｂ
「...」
Looks like they finally left...
％Ｂ
「Hahhh... That was a close one...」
I should get out while I can...
$$smh_OpenCHK
％Ｂ
「Ahh～ ...So hooott...」
I'm all dizzy from the heat.
I'm looking for somewhere where I can feel the evening breeze, so I can cool off.
I don't see the girls anywhere.
Maybe they're still changing?
？？？／律佳
「Lala～ lalala～ Lala～ lalala～」
I can hear a clear voice singing somewhere.
I look around for the owner of the voice.

「Lalalalala～, la～ la～ la～ la～」
It's Narusawa.
She's sitting on a large rock by the river, with her feet in the water up to her ankles.
Splish... splash... splish!
She occasionally kicks her feet.
It's like watching a kid having fun. It makes me smile.

％Ｂ
「Narusawa. What are you up to in a place like this?」
Narusawa turns around when I call out her name, looking a little surprised.
Her singing stops.
That's a shame.
Rikka
「Just cooling off. I sat in the hot springs a little too long.」
％Ｂ
「Same here. Mind if I sit next to you?」
Rikka
「No.」
Narusawa shifts over a bit so I can also sit on the rock.
I also lower my feet into the water.
％Ｂ
「Phew... That feels real nice.」
Rikka
「What? You sound like an old man.」
％Ｂ
「Well sorry about that. But it really does feel nice.」
Rikka
「Yes, it does. It feels nice.」
Splish... splash...
Narusawa's legs sway in time with the comfortable currents of the clear river water.

％Ｂ
「Where are the others?」
Rikka
「Ousaka-san and Okihara-senpai were still changing when I finished.」

Rikka
「Yukimura-san was goofing off going, "Ahh～" into the changing room fan, and Segawa-san and Shinozaki-san said they'd go to the gift shop while they waited for us to change.」


％Ｂ
「Oh yeah. I remember there was a small souvenir shop or something near the entrance.」
％Ｂ
「You sure you don't wanna take a look?」
Rikka
「I'm not interested.」
Yeah, but I think looking at stuff like that together with everyone is part of the fun of going on a trip.

Though, well...
％Ｂ
「It's great that we got to freshen up in the baths.」
Rikka
「Yes. The open-air bath felt nice.」
％Ｂ
「Right? The view was just amazing.」
Rikka
「What? You were able to go in the open-air bath?」
％Ｂ
「Uh... Oh!」
That's right! I wasn't supposed to be able to get in through the men's bath!
％Ｂ
「Uh, um... N-No.」
％Ｂ
「I couldn't get into the open-air bath from the men's side 'cause the door was locked. I was just talking about how the view must've been nice, 'cause I saw it on a poster advertising that bath.」


Rikka
「Really? You seem suspicious. Like you're hiding something.」
％Ｂ
「I'm not hiding anything! I hope I get to go in the open-air bath next time～ ...Hahahahaha.」

Rikka
「...Well, whatever.」
％Ｂ
「A-Anyway, you have a little sister, right? Is her name Meguru?」

Rikka
「What? ...How did you know?」
％Ｂ
「I saw a poster for her debut album at the CD shop yesterday, and I bought one.」

Rikka
「Ohh... So you saw that. That's right, Meguru is my younger sister. She's one year younger than me.」

％Ｂ
「There were some songs that I knew too, and it was a pretty comfortable listen. Oh yeah, and I was a little surprised that there was a recording of "A Fragment of Emotion" too.」


Rikka
「I think that's probably because that's a piece my mom composed.」
％Ｂ
「What!? Your mom composed "A Fragment of Emotion"!?」

Rikka
「She did. She currently lives together with Meguru in Salzburg.」
％Ｂ
「Salzburg?」
Rikka
「In Austria. It's a big city for music, and it's famous for being Mozart's birthplace.」


％Ｂ
「Mozart...」
The name evokes conflicting emotions in me after what happened earlier.
Rikka
「Something you want to say?」
％Ｂ
「I have completely and utterly lost!」
％Ｂ
「Still, they're in Europe? That's pretty far. How long have you been living alone for?」

％Ｂ
「So they're in Europe? That's pretty far. How long have you been living alone for?」

Rikka
「Since a little before I started high school. Though my life didn't really change, since my parents were always busy with Meguru before that.」


％Ｂ
「You weren't lonely?」
Rikka
「I'm used to it.」
She says it like it's not a big deal.
Maybe that's part of why Narusawa seems so mature...
Rikka
「Ousaka-san and Okihara-san should be done changing by now, don't you think? Let's go.」

all
Narusawa moves to stand up...
But her foot catches on some moss on the rock...
Slip...!
Rikka
「Wha...」
And so she begins to fall.
％Ｂ
「Narusawa!!」
Rikka
「Kyahhh!!」
％Ｂ
「Ghhh... Hahhh～ You... all right?」
I tried to pull her close, but I couldn't fully fight gravity. I'm completely soaked.

Though I did manage to protect Narusawa's head from the rocks directly below.

Rikka
「Oh... I-I'm sorry.」
％Ｂ
「This is nothing. Sorry I couldn't stop you from falling.」
Rikka
「No, that's... You too...」
％Ｂ
「Are you hurt?」
Rikka
「No... Nothing hurts. How about you?」
％Ｂ
「I think I'm fine.」
From what I can tell, it's just that my leg's a little red from when I hit it against a rock when I tried to grab her. It doesn't look like I even have any scrapes.

％Ｂ
「Haha... Man, we're soaked. But still, this feels nice.」

Rikka
「It does, hehe...」
Narusawa laughs at my laughing.
This feels pleasant. My warmed-up body's being cooled down nicely.
Rikka
「Hey
, Hino-kun

...」
％Ｂ
「Hm?」
Rikka
「Thank you.」
She seems embarrassed, almost ticklish.
I've never seen such a soft smile from Narusawa...
And it's more than enough to get my heart hammering away in my ribcage.
Rikka
「
Hino-kun
...
?」
％Ｂ
「Uh, y-yeah...」
Crap... What is this?
I'm sitting in a river, but my body's getting all hot again.

I can't look at her in the eye. I look down―
％Ｂ
「...Bhh!」
And my body gets hot again for another reason.
Narusawa's white one-piece dress is sticking wetly to her body, outlining her pale-blue bra and underwear, as well as her pale white skin.


D-Don't look don't look don't look don't look...!!
The more I scream at myself in my head, the more my gaze locks on to her body.\n\r

I can't help but recall what I heard in the hot springs.
Rikka
「...What's the matter?」
Narusawa notices me acting weird, and looks down to follow my gaze...
Rikka
「...!!」
And turns bright red.
She's so red I can hardly believe that this is the same cold, calm, expressionless Narusawa that I know.

Rikka
「D-Don't look!!」
She covers her chest and crotch with both hands.
But she can't completely hide herself.
I can't stop myself from staring at her while she does that.

I didn't know Narusawa made faces like that...
It shouldn't be surprising at all that she does, but it's just so interesting to me. I feel like I got kinda lucky.

Rikka
「Didn't I tell you not to look!?」
％Ｂ
「R-Right! My bad!」
I frantically avert my gaze.
I can see a group of girls walk this way on their way home.

％Ｂ
「Sorry! You'll just have to bear this!」
I cover her with my body, trying to hide her.
They might be girls over there, but I doubt she'd want strangers to see her like this.

Rikka
「What!? 
Hino-kun... 

Hey...! B-Bear it? How am I supposed to...!?」

Rikka
「What are you getting on top of me like that for!? What are you thinking!?」
％Ｂ
「I know what you're thinking, but there are certain circumstances...」
Rikka
「What circumstances!? Is this a guy thing!? I'm going to scream!」

％Ｂ
「I kinda wish you wouldn't, or more like, it'd be great if you could be quiet for a second. I don't want us to stand out.」


Rikka
「You want me to be quiet so we don't stand out... What, so you can hide your crime!? There's no way I'm going to just do what you say!」

％Ｂ
「You're pretty mixed up right now... C'mon now, let's get the calm and collected Narusawa back.」

Rikka
「I thought you were a stalker, but you're actually a sex offender! You freak! Hurry up and get off of me!」

％Ｂ
「I'm pretty sure you won't like what'll happen if I move.」
Rikka
「I'm pretty sure I won't like it more if you don't...! Huh? Is that people talking?」
Looks like she's finally noticed that people are drawing closer.
Rikka
「Uh, um... Wait, are you trying to protect...」
％Ｂ
「I'm glad you've figured it out so quickly. Stay still. I'll try to make it so people can't see you.」

Rikka
「O-Okay.」
I can hear the voices get closer.
Eventually, I can hear them right behind me.
Camping Woman A
「Hehe. Hey, look at that.」
Camping Woman B
「That's so booold～ Look at them, holding each other in a place like that～」
Camping Woman C
「Aaaghh! Salt in my wound...! Give me back my peaceful trip to forget about my heartbreak!」

Camping Woman A
「Come on now. You have to be happy for other people's love. Being prejudiced is only going to make it harder to find new love.」

Camping Woman B
「I think I'll get my boyfriend to squeeze me reeeal tight when I get back～ Be careful not to get sick, you two～」

％Ｂ
「Phew... Looks like they didn't see. Here.」
I stand up, look away from Narusawa, and hold out my hand to her.

Rikka
「...Thank you.」
She grips my hand a little hesitantly.
I pull hard to help her stand up.
I take off my hoodie and hand it to Narusawa as she wrings the water out from the hem of her dress.

％Ｂ
「I'm pretty sure there was a dryer at the hot springs, so put this on until we get there. The sleeves are wet, but the rest should be fine.」


Rikka
「...Thank you.」
％Ｂ
「Haha.」
Rikka
「What's so funny?」
％Ｂ
「I was just thinking about how you've only been saying thank you for a while now.」
Rikka
「Because I'm grateful. Of course I'd say thank you.」
％Ｂ
「You're right. But it's still funny.」
Rikka
「What's that supposed to mean?」
She looks kinda sulky.
This is a new expression too.
I feel like I've gotten to know a lot about Narusawa in just one day.
％Ｂ
「Anyway, come on. Hurry up and wear this, before anyone else shows up.」

Rikka
「...Thank you.」
％Ｂ
「You're welcome.」
Rikka
「...」
Narusawa puts one of her arms through the sleeves of my hoodie, and then stops.

％Ｂ
「Something wrong?」
Rikka
「This... smells. Is this your smell
, Hino-kun

?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, 'cause I was wearing it. But it's better than nothing, right?」
Rikka
「I didn't mean it like that... It just made me hesitate a little.」

％Ｂ
「Does it really smell that bad!? I'm so sorry!」
Rikka
「I told you, I didn't mean it like that. It's just that... I had this strange thought, that it was like wrapping you around me.」





％Ｂ
「...」
She may not have meant to do it, but now I can't help but feel strangely conscious.

My skin feels a little hotter than before.
Rikka
「It's so big... It smells like sweat. Like a guy.」
She grumbles and complains while she puts it on, but her expression is soft.

％Ｂ
「Narusawa, time to sprint over there before we catch a cold!」
Rikka
「Wha, wait a minute! Geez!」
She follows after me after a bit of a delay.
I slow my pace to match hers.
The wind feels good against my flushed cheeks.
The smell of nature fills up my body.
Natsuki
「―And so what happened, exactly?」
％Ｂ
「I just told you, didn't I? The two of us slipped and fell in the river.」

Natsuki
「Uh huh, the two of you both, I see... You just fell in, did you?」

The questioning's continued even after we dried our clothes.
Marika
「You tried to save Narusawa-san, right? I think that's incredible...」

Natsuki
「And Marika praises him again...」
all
Misa
「But still, trying to save a girl without paying heed to your own safety! I don't think that would be an easy thing to do!」

Sora
「...*nod*」
all
Touko
「Would you save me if I were drowning too?」
％Ｂ
「Of course I would.」
I answer without hesitation.
I don't even have to think about it. If there's someone in trouble in front of me, then I'd wanna help as much as I'm able.

Touko
「Hmm～ I think I'll go there now, then.」
Marika
「Y-Yukimura-san, where are you going!? You can't do it on purpose～!」

Touko
「That so? That's a shame. It sounded fun.」
Misa
「It's dangerous. At times, nature gently surrounds us within her gentle bosom, but at times she can show the extent of her fury.」


Misa
「We don't know what may happen if we don't remain vigilant in interacting with her.」

％Ｂ
「Now, now, Okihara-senpai. I'm sure Yukimura wasn't serious about it either.」

Touko
「...But I was.」
Misa
「Touko-san!」
Touko
「Agh! Jellyfish-senpai got mad!」
％Ｂ
「After I went and backed you up, too...」
all
Okihara-senpai starts explaining to Yukimura what kind of mindset she should have when interacting with nature.

％Ｂ
「Narusawa. You don't have any chills or anything?」
Rikka
「No, I don't. Thanks to you.」
％Ｂ
「Okay. That's good, the―aaacchoo!! Ughh... *sniff*」

Sora
「A cold?」
Marika
「What? ...You caught a cold!? Oh no, that's not good～」

％Ｂ
「Haha. This'll blow over with a good night's―acchoo! Aaacchooo!」

Rikka
「Hehe, geez... Why are you worrying over me when you're like that? Here.」

She giggles and holds out some tissues.
It's a cute package of flower-patterned tissues.
I gratefully accept them and blow my nose. They're scented. I can smell a gentle floral scent.

％Ｂ
「Uuhh... *sniff*... Thanks. I'm ashamed.」
Rikka
「You don't have a fever, do you?」
％Ｂ
「!」
She places her delicate hand against my forehead.
It feels cool and nice.
Narusawa closes her eyes and places her other hand on her own forehead, comparing the temperatures.

Rikka
「Mmm... It... doesn't look like you have a fever.」
％Ｂ
「Y-Yeah... I'm fine.」
Natsuki
「Pff. But your face is tomato red instead.」
％Ｂ
「Shut up.」
Natsuki
「And Rikka, why'd you do that? Did you fall for him hard after he saved you?」

Rikka
「No, I didn't. I just feel responsible, because it's my fault this happened.」
％Ｂ
「...Acchoo!」
It's a bit painful to hear her deny it flatly.
...Though it's not like I really wanted her to say yes anyway.
Natsuki
「But you're worried about him, right?」
Rikka
「Yes, I am...」
Natsuki
「That's great～ Looks like you've still got a chance
, Hino

.」
％Ｂ
「What?」
Rikka
「S-Segawa-san!」
all
Rikka
「Th-That's not what I meant
, Hino-kun

. I'm worried, but it's because I feel responsible, and...」

％Ｂ
「Haha, I know.」
Rikka
「...」
Narusawa looks a little conflicted when I laugh in response, and looks up at the sky.
％Ｂ
「Either way, I'm glad nothing happened to you, Narusawa.」
Rikka
「...Thank you.」
all
Natsuki
「Fu, fu, fuuuh! Oh my, look at you being so nice to all of us girls～」

％Ｂ
「That's not true.」
Natsuki
「Oh, it is. You're so passionate about helping out with Sora and Misa-san's clubs, too. Trying to put together a harem or something?」



Marika
「A harem!?」
all
Sora
「Harem... It means for many women to be around one man. It perfectly describes us right now.」


Marika
「I know what it means... Wh-What? ...Really? You want to make a harem...?」

％Ｂ
「No, of course not! I just want one girlfriend to treasure!」

all
Natsuki
「Is that so... I definitely thought you'd have preferred the harem.」
Rikka
「I wouldn't want to be just one out of many.」
Natsuki
「Oho. It seems Rikka's more of a monopolizer than I thought～」
Rikka
「N-No I'm not... That's not what I meant.」
all
Sora
「One lover. Common sense.」
Marika
「Oh, okay... Yeah, it's best to be with the person you like.」
％Ｂ
「More importantly, we need to hurry, or else we're gonna miss the last bus.」
all
The campground's in the mountains, so there aren't that many buses per day. They stop operating before the sun sets.

If we miss the last one, we'll have to sleep outside, since we didn't bring any tents or anything.

Looks like Okihara-senpai's just about finished lecturing Yukimura, too.
Yukimura looks absolutely exhausted, even though it was only for a few minutes.

Touko
「No more... I wanna go home already!」
Misa
「Yes, that sounds like a good idea. Now that Touko-san has gotten an understanding of the greatness of nature. Hehe.」

Okihara-senpai smiles radiantly, looking incredibly satisfied.
all
We meet back up in front of the hot springs after changing.
Everyone looks refreshed. Looks like they all enjoyed the open-air bath.
Sora
「...I want to come again.」
Marika
「Yeah. Let's come again together.」
Natsuki
「The hot springs felt nice, too. We could try staying the night next time!」

Sora
「I want to see the stars.」
Rikka
「I'm sure they're very clear out here.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. We could all go stargazing together.」
all
We all look up at the sky as the bus trundles along homeward.
I spot a particularly bright star up in the indigo sky.
％Ｂ
「What's that one?」
Sora
「Vega, which is in the constellation Lyra. It's a summer sky first-magnitude star... It's also called Orihime's star.」

Misa
「Orihime and Hikoboshi... The stars from the story of Tanabata.」
Marika
「They can only meet once a year, right? ...I feel so sorry for them.」
Rikka
「If you think about it as them always being able to meet once a year on a certain date, no matter what, then it might not be too bad.」

Marika
「You think so? ...If I had a lover, then I'd want to see him every day...」

Rikka
「Oh, well aren't you romantic, Shinozaki-san?」
Marika
「Huh? Oh, uuuuh～ ...That's not true～」
Misa
「No, I think it's a very wonderful thing!」
Natsuki
「As for me... Hmm～ I dunno, since I've never really thought about it.」
Touko
「Hey, which one's Hikoboshi?」
Sora
「Altair... Alpha Aquilae is around there.」
She slides her fingertip from Vega toward the southeastern quadrant of the night sky.
％Ｂ
「Orihime and Hikoboshi...」
I wouldn't wanna be in a situation where I could only meet someone once a year...
But I do want to fall in love, and I want to have a lover too.
I don't just want someone who's cute. I want a girlfriend to really love.

It's been a week since I transferred here...
My surroundings have changed.
I've made new friends.
I feel like if I wanted to change things, then I could change almost anything.
I wonder what my school life from this point onward is going to be like.
The traditional date for Tanabata is in two months... It'll be my first Shionagi Tanabata Festival in a long time...
―I wonder who I'll be spending it with.
Maybe...
Maybe it'll be with someone out of these six―
