Despite it being the weekend, the market's pretty empty in the morning.
Shinozaki and I walk side by side through the streets.
％Ｂ
「Where are you gonna buy your swimsuit?」
Marika
「Well～ There's a place that sells really cute ones just a little past here... but I think they might be a little too cute for me...」


％Ｂ
「That's not true, is it? I think something like that'd look good on you.」

Marika
「Y-You think so～? Then could we go see if you're right?」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, of course!」
Marika
「Oh, it's this store.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, this one... Oh. This one.」
all
It's a really girly-looking storefront. I guess it's what I'd expect from a store that's supposed to sell cute swimwear.

And of course, all of the customers are girls.
Marika
「Um... I-I'm sorry. I guess it's a bit hard for you to go in?」
She's not wrong... Or more like, it's ridiculously hard to walk in.\n \n\r
I can even see a few of the female customers glance suspiciously over at me even though all I'm doing is just standing in front of the store.

Marika
「M-Maybe... we should go somewhere else?」
％Ｂ
「But you wanted to buy one here, right?」
Marika
「Yeah, I did... but I still think the ones here are too cute for me...」

％Ｂ
「That's not true. I'm sure they'll look good on you.. Okay! Let's go in!」

Marika
「Y-You sure?」
％Ｂ
「I'm fine, I'm fine. It's not like there's a sign that says "No men allowed" out front or something. There's nothing to worry about.」


％Ｂ
「C'mon, let's go!」
Marika
「Okay♪」
all
％Ｂ
「S-So tired...」
Shinozaki really took her time deciding on what to get, and I ended up trapped in that fancy, girly store for almost an hour.


It was just me in there alone while Shinozaki was using the changing rooms.
I was the center of attention while I was waiting in the store.
I learned today that looks could probably literally kill.
％Ｂ
「Well... I think I've seen a lifetime's worth of Shinozaki in a swimsuit thanks to that, though.」

％Ｂ
「...Hm?」
I sense someone behind me.
And of course, it's...
Marika
「Th-Thank you for waiting～」
Shinozaki, from the changing rooms.
It's pretty crowded here today, but it looks like she managed to change without incident.
Marika
「W-What do you think～? Does it... look good on me?」
She seems nervous in her new swimsuit.

To me, it looks like she's shining.
Forget just calling her cute or pretty... She seems brighter than the summer sun to me.

％Ｂ
「Don't worry! That looks great on you!」
It isn't flattery.
She tried out lots of different swimsuits, and this one looked the best on her.

Marika
「Oh, then, then, um...」
％Ｂ
「Y-Yeah. It looks good on you, and uh... You look cute.」

Marika
「W-Waaah～ ...Thanks... I'm glad I picked this one, if you think so... and I really like it too.」


Marika
「I'm glad you came with me to pick it out. You have really good fashion sense too. Probably because you're so good at art.」

％Ｂ
「Y-You think so? Either way, I'm glad you like it.」

She's just so cute.
That new swimsuit, and that smile just for me.
I feel like I might melt away just watching.
Marika
「There's lots of people here, though.」
The newly opened beach is filled with families and couples.
It seems even more crowded because of all the tarps laid out, further limiting where we can walk.

all
Girl
「Yaaaay! It's the ocean!」
Thud!
Marika
「Oh... I-I'm sorry...」
％Ｂ
「You all right? Be careful, it's way more crowded than I thought it'd be.」
Marika
「O-Okay...」
It feels strangely dangerous here.
With how crowded it is, I feel like we might lose track of each other the moment we let our minds wander.
％Ｂ
「...」
It wouldn't be good if we got separated.
...All right!
％Ｂ
「Shinozaki. Here.」
Marika
「Oh...」
I reach out and take her hand.
％Ｂ
「'Cause we don't wanna get separated... Uh... O-Or maybe you don't wanna?」

Marika
「N-No! I'm totally fine with it! Y-Yeah, you have to keep an eye on me, after all... I'm more at ease this way...」

％Ｂ
「Right? We'll stay together this way, so...」
Marika
「Yeah... We'll definitely be together... Yeah.」
Shinozaki squeezes my hand.
Her hand is even smaller and daintier than I thought.
It's so soft.
％Ｂ
「It's... kinda weird, huh? We never walked around holding hands like this back when we were kids.」


Marika
「Yeah, since I was always in bed. We almost never got to walk around outside together.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah.」
Marika
「I'm kinda happy. I'm getting to do something that I never got to do back then...」

％Ｂ
「Something you never got to do back then?」
Marika
「Oh, n-no, that's not what I mean! Or it is what I meant, but... How should I say it... Never mind.」


％Ｂ
「O-Okay?」
When she said "something she never got to do back then"... does she mean walk holding hands like this?

Just what could that mean?
Maybe it doesn't mean anything, since it would've been between two kids?
Or maybe...
Marika
「Oh, m-maybe this spot?」
She comes to a stop.
We've walked a long way, and come up to a spot that seems a lot less crowded than the central area.

％Ｂ
「All right. Let's lay our picnic sheet down here, then.」
all
I pull the tarp out from my bag and lay it down.
Shinozaki places our bags and our sandals on the four corners.
It's some well-coordinated teamwork.
％Ｂ
「The sun sure is strong. Maybe I should go rent a beach parasol or something?」

Marika
「But did you see how expensive they were～?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, I did... but I'm just worried, you know? Did you make sure to put on sunscreen today?」

Marika
「Yeah, I did. Oh... but I don't know if my back's completely okay...」

％Ｂ
「What? Want me to do it again?」
I say it a little jokingly, because I did end up doing it once before.
Marika
「Oh, u-umm～ ...Then I might ask you to again... maybe.」

She nods bashfully.
％Ｂ
「Uh... You sure?」
Marika
「Y-Yeah. Since I've asked you once before...」
I can't help but feel self-conscious when she's acting like that.
Marika
「Then... please...」
all
She turns her back to me.
Once again, I find myself nervous again when facing that pale, vulnerable back.
％Ｂ
「Uhh... Ready?」
Marika
「Yeah... Be gentle, okay?」
I-Is that what you say at a time like this?
Do people normally go, "Be gentle, okay?" when they have someone put sunscreen on for them?

That's just making me even more self-conscious.
％Ｂ
「...」
I paint her back with sunscreen, trying as hard as I can not to think about what I'm doing.

％Ｂ
「Like this?」
Marika
「Ahaha, that tickles a bit～」
％Ｂ
「M-My bad.」
Marika
「Hehe... You don't need to apologize.」
Marika
「But you know, we've been doing a lot of this kind of stuff. With the sunscreen, and me washing your back.」

％Ｂ
「You've got a point. Like a bare-skin kinda relationship, or...」

I immediately stop myself after idly saying what came to mind.
But Shinozaki definitely heard that.
Marika
「Y-Yeah...」
She's red all the way down from her ears to her neck.
Marika
「B-But we really do end up in swimsuits together a lot. We even met again for the first time at the pool...」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, you're right. Maybe that's just our fate... or something.」

Marika
「Wh-What do you mean by fate?」
％Ｂ
「Huh? Well, I dunno specifically...」
Crap. I feel like this conversation's only getting weirder.
％Ｂ
「I-I'm done.」
Marika
「Th-Thanks...」
％Ｂ
「...」
Marika
「...」
％Ｂ
「...A-All right! Now that you're good on sunscreen, let's go swim!」

Marika
「Y-Yeah! Y-You're right!」
It'd be a waste to just sit here in silence after coming out to the beach.
I jump up to my feet and yell.
all
％Ｂ
「All right, now let's go out and...!」
Grumble～～～
Marika
「Y-Your stomach...」
And so, my stomach growls just as I'm trying to get things going.
...What terrible timing.
Marika
「Are you hungry?」
％Ｂ
「...Seems like it.」
I didn't notice because I was so nervous.
But I guess it is almost noon already.
We were at the marketplace for a while, after all.
Marika
「Well, it's a bit early, but do you want to have lunch?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, let's do that. Let's go to one of the beach houses, then. You can get whatever you want. My treat.」


Marika
「What!? R-Really?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, I've got money saved up from my part-time job from before I moved back here. And besides, I wanna thank you for making food for me the other day.」

Marika
「W-Waaah... Then I think I'll accept～ ...Th-They all look so good～」

Shinozaki's looking at the line of beach houses with excitement in her eyes.
％Ｂ
「All right! Then let's just go to all of them!」
all
Marika
「Sorry I couldn't really decide... You ended up buying a lot...」

％Ｂ
「It's fine. I wanted to try a lot of different things too.」
We got yakisoba, grilled corn, and grilled squid.
Shinozaki wasn't really able to narrow it down to one thing, so I suggested we share all of it.

％Ｂ
「Oh yeah, this yakisoba's great!」
Marika
「And this corn's nice and fragrant♪ Here, try some～」

She holds out the corn cob that she was eating.
I can see her bite marks on it.
Isn't this, uh...
Shinozaki also realizes when she notices me hesitate for a moment.
Marika
「Oh, right... Th-This is kind of embarrassing, isn't it?」
％Ｂ
「Y-Yeah. But it's too late for that now.」
Marika
「Y-Yeah... We already bought it... and we want to try them all...」
％Ｂ
「Okay! Then let's say we won't care about stuff like that, just for today!」
Marika
「O-Okay, yeah. We're sharing, after all. Then I'm going to have some yakisoba too♪」

％Ｂ
「And I'll have some corn!」
The two of us bite into each other's food.
％Ｂ
「Oh, this really is good!」
Marika
「Wow, this yakisoba's great right off the bat～! It tastes really authentic.」

％Ｂ
「It's some B-tier gourmet place called Yuunagi Yakisoba. Their red miso flavoring's apparently a big deal.」

Marika
「Beach houses must put a lot of thought into their foods. The flavor's soaked into the noodles. It's so good～ Everyone's happy when they're eating tasty foods.」


％Ｂ
「Then you'd definitely be able to make people happy. Your food's great.」

Marika
「Huh? ...You think so?」
％Ｂ
「I was pretty bummed about breaking my foot, but I considered myself pretty lucky for getting to eat lots of your food.」


Marika
「You're praising me too much. Ehehe... but it makes me happy～ Oh, the yakisoba... it's so good...」


She blushes a bit, and then eats a mouthful of yakisoba to hide her embarrassment.
％Ｂ
「You know you've pretty much finished that plate, right?」
Marika
「You're right!? I'm sorry. I was planning on leaving some...」

％Ｂ
「No need to hold back. I can just go get another one. Want me to get more for you too, if you've still got room?」

Marika
「I-Is it okay? Ehehehehe... Then I'll take you up on that offer～ I think I'll have some more.」


all
Marika
「Excuse me, miss! Some Yuunagi yakisoba, please! And oden, and grilled squid, and shaved ice too!」

％Ｂ
「That's a ton of food...」
I wonder if we'll be okay eating that much...
Marika
「I ate too muuuch...」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, saw that one coming.」
We may have shared it all between the two of us, but I'm pretty full too.
Marika
「My belly's all round...」
％Ｂ
「Hm? Really?」
Marika
「W-Waaah～ ...I'd like it if you didn't look～」
She frantically covers her belly.
％Ｂ
「Sure, but I don't think you'll be able to hide it wearing a bikini. Plus, I don't think it's really sticking out that much.」

Marika
「I'm doing my best to suck it in～ ...It'll pop out if I let my guard down...」

％Ｂ
「F-Fine, I get it. I won't look too much.」
Marika
「Don't do it, okay?」
But I just can't take my eyes off of her.
She's telling me not to look, but I can't stop myself from watching her every movement.
Marika
「Oh... I know. Let's try this.」
She shows me some tickets she got at the beach house.
You apparently get one per every 500 yen spent. It's like a lottery ticket.
We spent about 2,000 yen, so she has four tickets.
Marika
「I wonder what you can get～」
％Ｂ
「Let's see... Whoa! First place gets a trip to Hawaii! That's crazy...」

Marika
「That's amazing～ Let's try our best to get it♪」
Marika
「But... what should we do if we get it? ...Do we go together?」

％Ｂ
「Well... if we win that, then we'll have to go...」
Marika
「Y-Yeah, right...?」
Marika
「But what should I tell my mom and dad～? The two of us, going on a trip together...」

％Ｂ
「Y-Yeah, that's true... Uhh, what would you tell them...?」

Marika
「It's a real problem～」
all
Beach House Employee
「You two, how about you think about it after you pull a lot?」
We've been called out in exasperation while we're lost in thought.
％Ｂ
「...That's true. Okay, let's give it a try.」

Marika
「You can go first, then.」
all
Shinozaki hands the employee a ticket.
It's one of those typical crank-handle wheel things where colored balls come out.
％Ｂ
「All right. Hawaii, first try!」
I grip the handle and start spinning it.
A trip to Hawaii!
Together... with Shinozaki!?
％Ｂ
「White! White, as in the color of Hawaiian clouds...!?」

Beach House Employee
「Group 5, a beach ball!」
％Ｂ
「Ghhh...!?」
That would've been all too convenient...
Marika
「But wow! We still won a beach ball!」
all
％Ｂ
「Just wondering, but how many possible outcomes are there?」
Beach House Employee
「There's five.」
So that was the worst one...
％Ｂ
「...Shinozaki. Sorry. You mind if I give it another go?」

I can't let it end here.
I've got my pride as a man!
Marika
「Yeah, you can! Good luck!」
She hands over another ticket.
all
％Ｂ
「All right! This time for sure!! ...Rraaaaaghhh!!」

％Ｂ
「Noooooooooooooooo!!? How could it possibly be white!?」

Beach House Employee
「Group 5, a beach ball!」
Marika
「Wow～ Now we have two beach balls♪」
％Ｂ
「Don't be happy, Shinozaki! Those are duds!」
Marika
「Want to try again?」
％Ｂ
「Y-You sure? But I've already done it twice.」
Marika
「Yeah, it's okay～ It'd make me happy if you did it until you were satisfied.」

％Ｂ
「Shinozaki... Are you an angel?」
Marika
「It-It isn't that big of a deal... Hehe... One more, please!」

Shinozaki hands over another ticket.
all
I can't let myself fail this time!
I can't let myself let Shinozaki's kindness go to waste!!
It doesn't have to be Hawaii!
Please let it at least be one higher! "Group 4, a Beach House Meal Ticket"!!
％Ｂ
「Let's do this! Rrrraaaaghhh!」
％Ｂ
「Aaaaaaaaaaaaghhhhhh!! Beeeeeeeeeeeach baaaaaaaalll!!」

The heartless white orb rolls there before me.
％Ｂ
「H-How could this happen... It's all over... This has to be the curse of that beach ball...」

Marika
「Curse? Did you do something to a beach ball before?」
％Ｂ
「I wanted to try flying through the sky in a hot air balloon back in grade school, so I tried using a beach ball.」

％Ｂ
「But the fire that I was using to heat up the air spread to the ball, and it just... It smelled so bad... That beach ball must've cursed me...」


Marika
「I think it's great that you had dreams like flying in a hot air balloon～」
％Ｂ
「Don't try to comfort me...」
Marika
「Don't be so down. There's still one more ticket♪」

％Ｂ
「Huh? Still one more? ...But if I use that, then you won't get to do it even once.」

Marika
「I'm okay～ Here, use one more if you want to try again.」

％Ｂ
「Shinozaki...」
You're such a wonderful woman...
all
Beach House Employee
「You've got yourself a real good girlfriend there, mister.」
％Ｂ
「Huh? Girlfriend?」
Marika
「G-Girlfriend? I'm not...」
Beach House Employee
「So what will it be?」
％Ｂ
「...I'm fine. Shinozaki, you should use the last one.」

Marika
「Are you sure?」
％Ｂ
「It's not sharing the moment if it's just me using them all, is it? I think it's meaningful 'cause we're doing it together.」

Marika
「Oh, okay... You're right! I'll try it too, then!」

Shinozaki hands over the final ticket.
％Ｂ
「Put your all into it, Shinozaki!!」
Marika
「Yeah, I will～! ...Hup!」

She spins the wheel.
And the color is...?
％Ｂ
「Whoa!? It's not white!!」
Marika
「It's blue! What's that mean～?」
Could this be... 
the blue of Hawaiian seas!?
all
Marika
「Yaaay! We did it～」
％Ｂ
「I thought we won a trip to Hawaii for a second...」
Marika
「Ahaha, yeah, me too～ But a watermelon splitting set sounds fun too.」

Shinozaki won the group 2 prize: a watermelon splitting set.
A watermelon, a stick, a blindfold, and a plastic sheet.
％Ｂ
「It's still pretty impressive that you got a second-place prize. But there's a crazy difference between this and the first-place one.」

Marika
「That's not true, it's great! I think I might've used up a lot of my luck～ But I'm glad I got to use it when I was with you.」


Marika
「I think I'll live out the rest of my life quietly.」
％Ｂ
「No, you don't need to decide that after winning some watermelon splitting set... Anyway, let's try it!」

Marika
「Okay!」
all
I lay down the plastic sheet and set up the watermelon on top.
％Ｂ
「You try it.」
Marika
「Huh? M-Me?」
％Ｂ
「We don't have another one of these, so it's over once it's split. You should do it, since you're the one who won it.」

Marika
「I'll do my best, then!」
She puts on her game face and grabs the stick.
％Ｂ
「I'm gonna blindfold you, then.」
Marika
「Okay.」
I place the towel over her eyes and tie it off from behind.
％Ｂ
「Gonna spin you around now～」
Marika
「Wa...Waaah...」
I spin her around on the spot a few times.
There's no real point in being mean to her here, so I stop her so she's directly facing the watermelon.

％Ｂ
「All right, we're good.」
Marika
「H-Here I go then, okay?」
She starts walking.
And she's immediately forty-five degrees off course!
After I purposefully had her face the watermelon!
％Ｂ
「Shinozaki, no! More to the left!」
Marika
「Huh? The left? Okaaay.」
％Ｂ
「Too much, too much! The ocean's that way!」
Marika
「Wh-Whaaat!? Then is it this way...?」
％Ｂ
「The beach houses are that way!! Oh god, don't swing the stick there, you're gonna kill someone!! This is pretty much terrorism!」


Marika
「W-Wawawah... Th-Then, this way?」
She finally turns toward the watermelon.
％Ｂ
「Th-That's it! That's the right way! Walk straight ahead, slowly... Slowly now, you hear?」

Marika
「Slowly... Slowly... Kyaaahh!?」
all
Craaaash!!
She trips over some sand and falls.
Marika
「Ow, ow...」
％Ｂ
「A-Are you okay? How do you trip when you're walking that slowly?」

Marika
「People aren't made to walk with their eyes clooosed... Auuuh～ I got sand in my mouth～」

％Ｂ
「You have a point, but still. Here, wipe your mouth with this towel... Be careful so you don't trip, okay?」


Marika
「O-Okay!」
She stands back up and carefully, carefully starts walking again.
She's moving at turtle levels of speed.
I'm worried that the sun might set before she gets there at that rate... but eventually, she makes it to the watermelon.

％Ｂ
「Right there, Shinozaki! You're facing exactly the right way, and you're at just the right spacing!」

Marika
「O-Okay! Here I go then... Hup!」
Ponk.
Shinozaki swings the stick down, and it makes an utterly hilarious sound as it bounces off the watermelon.

Marika
「I hit it! Is it split?」
％Ｂ
「Uh... Well you hit it, but it's not split...」
Marika
「Whaaat, whyyy? One more time, then! ...Hup!」
Plunk.
The stick makes direct contact with the watermelon.
But it bounces off again, leaving the watermelon unscathed.
％Ｂ
「Th-Think you could hit it a little harder?」
Marika
「But I'm hitting it as hard as I can～」
Plunk... Plunk...
She hits it over and over, but it does nothing.
Shinozaki... You're so weak...
You can't even break a watermelon.
Marika
「Uuuuh, it's not breaking～ ...Could you help me～?」
％Ｂ
「Guess I have to...」
It'd be just too pitiful to watch this.
I place my arms around her from behind so we're both holding the stick together.
Actually, this position we're in is pretty questionable...
I can see her soft cleavage right before my eyes.
％Ｂ
「H-Here we go then.」
Marika
「Okay!」
The two of us lift the stick and swing it down hard.
all
Marika
「Oh... Did it split?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, it split.」
That's what's supposed to happen, yeah...
Clap clap clap clap!
all
％Ｂ
「Hm?」
I suddenly hear applause. I look around to see that there are suddenly a gaggle of kids around us.

Marika
「Huh? Kids?」
Shinozaki looks taken aback once she takes the blindfold off too.
Girl A
「Congratulations!」
Marika
「Congratulations? For what?」
Girl B
「You guys got married, right?」
Marika
「What!? Married...!?」
％Ｂ
「Wh-Why are we married?」
Girl A
「Because that was the first teamwork thing.」
％Ｂ
「Oh...」
Now that she mentions it...
I could see how that could look like a married couple cutting their wedding cake.
Though it was a watermelon instead of a cake...
Girl B
「Congratulations on getting married!!」
Marika
「N-Nooo～ This wasn't us getting married... It was watermelon splitting～」

Girl A
「But you do that by yourself.」
Marika
「Well... that's true, but...」
Shinozaki's smile looks a little strained.
Marika
「...I know! Want to all eat the watermelon together?」
Girl B
「I want soooome!!」
Looks like she's decided to change the subject by offering them food.
Marika
「Is it okay if we give them some?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, of course. Not like we could've eaten all of this by ourselves anyway.」

Marika
「Yeah, since we're full already～」
％Ｂ
「Okaaay! Then how about we all play soccer after eating watermelon! 'Cause we've got three beach balls!」

Girl A
「I wanna plaaaay!」
Marika
「Ahaha, it's cute how they're so honest～ How about we eat the watermelon, then?」

Girl B
「Okaaaaay!!」
all
Girl A
「Bye, Onii-chan, Onee-chan!」
％Ｂ
「Yeah! Be careful on your way home!」
Marika
「Bye-bye! See you again♪」
By the time we part ways with the children, it's almost sunset.
Marika
「We ended up playing with them a lot～」
％Ｂ
「I'm beat. Kids have infinite stamina.」
Marika
「They're just so energetic～ Ehehehe.」
％Ｂ
「Ahaha...」
Marika
「...」
Silence suddenly descends after we laugh together.
We had forgotten about it while the kids were around... but we can't help but get self-conscious once it's just the two of us.

％Ｂ
「It's 'cause they were talking about marriage and stuff...」
Marika
「Huh? Marriage?」
％Ｂ
「Oh, uh... Those kids earlier...」
Marika
「Oh, yeah... K-Kids just have the wildest imaginations! And I can see how they came up with that idea...」

％Ｂ
「Y-Yeah, I know... Ahaha...」
Marika
「Aha, ha...」
Silence again.
The sky's getting gradually more yellow. Sunset is close.

％Ｂ
「W-Wanna go home now?」
Marika
「Y-Yeah, we probably should...」
Marika
「Thanks for today. It was so much fun.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. Same for me.」
Marika
「...」
％Ｂ
「...」
We're walking side by side, but we can't keep a conversation going.
Even though we were so excited on the way here. What could've changed since then?

Marika
「U-Umm～ Which way's... the bus stop, again?」
％Ｂ
「That way. Looks like everyone else is going home too, so don't get separated from me, all right?」

Marika
「You're right... We'll need to be careful. I don't come here too often, so we should make sure not to get lost.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah...」
She smiles a little bashfully.
I silently grab her hand that's idly swinging at her side.
Marika
「Oh...」
％Ｂ
「...It's better this way, right?」
Marika
「Ye...Yeah!」
She smiles, and squeezes my hand.
And I grip her hand back.
Marika
「...」
％Ｂ
「...」
It's weird.
All that's changed is that we're holding hands now, but I don't mind the silence anymore.\n\r
We're just walking along silently, but I'm somehow satisfied.
Marika
「...」
I wonder what Shinozaki's thinking.
Is she thinking the same thing?
Eventually, the bus stop appears in our line of sight.
％Ｂ
「...」
Marika
「...」
％Ｂ
「...」
It'd be nice if we had to wait for a while for the bus.
That way, I'd get to be like this with Shinozaki for longer.
Marika
「Oh...」
But the bus comes right away.
Marika
「The bus is here...」
Am I just fooling myself into thinking she sounds disappointed?
Maybe she feels the same way I do. Maybe she wants to be together for a while longer?

Am I just deluding myself into thinking that?
all
Shinozaki lets go of my hand as she hurries toward the bus.

％Ｂ
「Gh...」
I grab her hand again. Tightly.
Marika
「Oh...」
She turns back toward me, unable to pull her hand away.
I'm just standing there, silently holding her hand.
Marika
「U-Umm～」
As Shinozaki hesitantly begins to say something...
The bus drives away without us on it.
Marika
「...The bus... left.」
％Ｂ
「Sorry...」
Marika
「N-No... I don't really mind... I-I was just thinking, "What happened～?"」

％Ｂ
「...There's something I wanna talk to you about.」
I hadn't intended on saying it.
But if I'm gonna say it, then now's the time.
My heart begins racing.
The sound echoes through my bones, all the way to my ears.
Marika
「Talk to me... about what?」
％Ｂ
「Um, well...」
I take a single breath.
％Ｂ
「I like you, Shinozaki.」
My confession's so simple that even I think it's anticlimactic.
Marika
「Wha...?」
Shinozaki looks at me as if she didn't hear me, but then her eyes widen in surprise.

Marika
「Huh? Was that... Um...」
％Ｂ
「I like you, Shinozaki. So... I want to go out with you.」

Marika
「...」
She's struck dumb.
She seems honestly surprised. Her mouth is open, but there's no sound coming out.

all
％Ｂ
「I know it might seem sudden, but it's not something I thought of on the spot...」

％Ｂ
「...Huh?」
I find myself also lost for words.
Because...
Marika
「Sniff... Hgh...」
Shinozaki's crying.
％Ｂ
「Wh-What's the matter? Why are you...」
Marika
「I'm so... Hgh... Sorry... Sniff...」
％Ｂ
「Shinozaki...」
Does this mean I've been rejected?
I wasn't so full of myself that I was confident I'd get a yes once I confessed...\n\r

But was it really bad enough to make her cry?
Marika
「I'm sorry... Hgh, nh...」
％Ｂ
「No... I'm sorry too... for saying something like that out of the blue... Sorry.」
Shinozaki whips her head from side to side as she cries.
all
Marika
「Fueeeeeeeehhhh...」
And Shinozaki cried for about thirty whole minutes after that.
％Ｂ
「You really sure I don't need to walk you back?」
Marika
「Yeah... It's okay.」
She nods. Her eyes are still red.
My heart aches again when I see those eyes.
Because I'm the one who made her cry.
％Ｂ
「Well... Thanks for today.」
It was so fun, but I completely ruined everything at the very end.\n\r

But there's nothing I can do about that now.
all
％Ｂ
「...Later then.」
Marika
「U-Um!」
She stops me as I'm about to walk into my house.
％Ｂ
「Hm?」
Marika
「...Yes.」
％Ｂ
「...Sorry?」
I have no idea what that was for.
Marika
「...It's my response.」
％Ｂ
「Response?」
Marika
「Huh? You didn't... forget, right...? When you asked, um, me out...」

％Ｂ
「...Huh?」
Logic fails me.
My mind's filled with question marks.
％Ｂ
「I thought... I was rejected?」
Marika
「Whaaat!? Why would you think that!?」
％Ｂ
「What do you mean, why... 'Cause you started crying... and it was really bad, too...」
Marika
「Th-That was... because I was surprised. Really surprised...」
％Ｂ
「That's all?」
Marika
「That's all? ...I was really surprised, you know. I didn't think that you liked me, Hino-kun...」


Marika
「That's all? ...I was really surprised, you know. I didn't think that you liked me...」


Marika
「That's why I got so surprised that I couldn't stop crying...」
％Ｂ
「I totally thought I got rejected...」
Marika
「There's no way I'd reject you... because I've always, always...」

Tears well up in her eyes once more.
％Ｂ
「Shinozaki...」
When I saw her tears earlier, my heart had been a pitch-black abyss. But now, it's shivering with emotion.

％Ｂ
「Um... Can I say it again? What I said before. I wanna say it properly.」

Marika
「...Yeah. I want to hear it.」
％Ｂ
「Then I'll say it.」
％Ｂ
「I like you, Shinozaki. I... want to go out with you.」

Marika
「...Yes. A-And I... ever since we were kids... have always liked you too, Hino-kun... You, and only you...」


Marika
「...Yes. A-And I... ever since we were kids... have always liked you too... You, and only you...」


She nods over and over while crying.
％Ｂ
「You're crying too much. Your parents are gonna be worried if you go home looking like that.」

Marika
「I'm sorry... It's not... stopping at all...」
％Ｂ
「You're such a crybaby, Shinozaki.」
I wipe the tears away from her cheeks.
Shinozaki jumps, and looks up at me.
％Ｂ
「Oh...」
I'm shocked at how close she is.
Her face is right there in front of me.
Shinozaki's staring right into my eyes, close enough that I could feel her breaths.
Marika
「...I... love you.」
She speaks.
And then raises her face a bit, still facing me.
％Ｂ
「Shinozaki...」
My mind is blank.
I just feel like this is the natural thing to do.
I gently place my lips over hers.
Marika
「...」
I don't know how long we were like that.
Maybe it was just a second. Maybe it was for a minute.
My mind went blank. I had no sensation of time...
The two of us were just standing still, with our lips pressed together.
