We're all going to the campground tomorrow.
Well, the more the merrier... so I'm gonna try inviting Yukimura along too.

_smh_st_01

_SMH_ST_01
％Ｂ
「...Huh? She's not picking up.」
There's no answer, even after trying for a while.
If the dial tone's ringing, then her phone shouldn't be out of juice again...

％Ｂ
「Oh well... Guess I'll leave a message.」
_smh_st_05
_smh_st_btn02
...Does Yukimura even check her messages?
It might be a good idea to call her again later.
％Ｂ
「We're all gonna hang out together tomorrow. You wanna come with? I'll call again later.」

_smh_st_04
I hope this can be an opportunity for her to get to know Shinozaki and the others better.

...And me too, of course.
％Ｂ
「Right, I should get ready too. I should go shopping!」

It's important to be prepared if you want to have a safe and fun camping experience.

$$smh_OpenCHK
So I'm gonna go to the big marketplace grocery store instead of the nearby small shops.

We're all supposed to bring some kind of food.

I'm in charge of bringing drinks and curry roux.
I volunteered myself, since I wasn't about to leave the heavy and cumbersome drinks to any of the girls.

％Ｂ
「I'll just buy a bunch of the big bottles. Mineral water and oolong tea of course, and...」

There are lots of different kinds of carbonated drinks. I could see people having lots of different preferences.
％Ｂ
「Guess I'll ask people over LIME.」
【％Ｂ】「Got a question for you #Nguys.」
【Marika】「What is it?」
Shinozaki responds immediately.
【％Ｂ】「I'm headed toward the #Nsupermarket on 1st #Nright now. Any requests #Nfor drinks for tomorrow?」
【Sora】「Plum soda.」
【Marika】「I like plum soda too. #NBut isn't that a #Nseasonal thing?」
【Sora】「Comes in cans.」
【％Ｂ】「Uhh～ Cans are bulky, so #NI dunno about those.」
【Sora】_st_0313
【Misa】「Perhaps orange juice? I #Nrecommend a straight-#Nproduced variety!」
【％Ｂ】「Straight-produced?」
【Misa】「It's a way of making #Norange juice not from #Nconcentrate, so one can #Nfully enjoy an all-#Nnatural taste!」
【Marika】「That's the kind that #Nthey sell in bottles at #Ngift shops, isn't it?」
【％Ｂ】「I think bottles may #Nalso be difficult.」
【Natsuki】「It's gotta be ginger #Nale! Ginger ale, no #Ncontest! Ginger ale #Nginger ale ginger ale #Nginger ale ginger ale #Nginger ale ginger ale」
You're scaring me! Why do you like ginger ale that much!?
【Sora】「If we want soft drinks #Nthen cola is good.」
【Marika】「It might be nice to #Nhave a sports drink if #Nwe're going to be #Nactive.」
【Natsuki】「Aquarius.」
【Sora】「Pocari.」
【Marika】「Ahaha... Everyone wants #Nsomething completely #Ndifferent.」
【Natsuki】「Maybe we should just #Nlet the person buying #Nthe drinks handle it?」
【％Ｂ】「You sure?」
【Sora】_st_0310
【Marika】_st_0109
【Misa】_st_0220
【％Ｂ】「Got it. I'll handle it.」
【％Ｂ】_st_0307
％Ｂ
「Phew.」
$$smh_OpenCHK
So I guess the gist of it is that people want soft drinks, fruit juice, and sports drinks.

As for the exact variety... I'll just see what's cheap once I'm there.
I resume walking.
％Ｂ
「Oh. This song...」
I've heard it before.
Where was it again...
Right, I remember.
It's "A Fragment of Emotion."
It's the theme song for Shionagi's Tanabata Festival. I heard it lots back when I was a kid.

I stop, reveling in the nostalgia. I take a look at the CD shop to see...

％Ｂ
「Narusawa Meguru?」
There's a poster with a photo of someone playing the piano, and the name of her debut album.

She seems different, but her facial features strongly resemble Narusawa.
Now that I think about it, I remember hearing her sister also plays piano...
％Ｂ
「Wait, what!? Narusawa's little sister's a professional pianist!?」
I'm so shocked I say it out loud.
I take a close look at the small print outlining her profile on the poster.

She's won many impressive awards.
She's from Shionagi City. Her mother is apparently a pianist known as Narusawa Sayaka.
I already heard from Shinozaki and Segawa that Narusawa's mother is a pianist.

It doesn't say anything about Narusawa herself on here, but this has to be her sister.

％Ｂ
「3,000 yen...」
％Ｂ
「...I've gone and bought it.」
It might be because I've been listening to Narusawa play piano lately.
Well, it won't be a bad thing to immerse myself in some fine arts for once.
I'll enjoy the CD once I'm home. I start heading toward my destination again.

？？？／律佳
「...」
...Flutter.
A girl with long hair catches my eye as she walks past me.
A sweet citrus scent tickles my nostrils.
all
％Ｂ
「Oh...」
_00cutinBS
That was Narusawa just now.
I grab a basket at the entrance as I follow after her.
Natsuki
「Ohh, hoh～ She's cute in her casual clothes too... Those refined lady types sure know how to score their points～」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, they do...」
_00cutinBS
％Ｂ
「Wait. Segawa!?」
Natsuki
「You're late. I was tired of waiting.」
％Ｂ
「I don't remember saying we should meet up...」
Natsuki
「I was already heading this way when you mentioned it on LIME. I figured I might as well wait for you.」


Natsuki
「And so here, take these.」
all
％Ｂ
「...Excuse me?」
...Thunk.
The basket in my hands grows heavy from the huge number of potatoes she just threw in.

Natsuki
「Potatoes. That's what I'm in charge of.」
％Ｂ
「That's not what I meant. Why'd you put it in my―」
Natsuki
「Come on, let's go.」
Segawa starts walking.
％Ｂ
「Sigh... Couldn't you at least listen to me?」
_00cutinBS
Natsuki
「She picks the bargain brands without hesitating... but she doesn't touch the weird imported ones... She's unexpectedly housewifeish...」


％Ｂ
「Isn't that normal if you live alone?」
Narusawa's walking a ways ahead of us.
We're not observing her, but she stands out, so we can't help but notice what she does.

_00cutinBS
Natsuki
「Oh, she grabbed a cheesecake cup! Those are so good...」

％Ｂ
「Huh. So Narusawa eats sweet stuff.」
_00cutinBS
Can't say I really expected that.
_00cutinBS
Natsuki
「Mmm, judging by the food and daily necessities, it looks like she really does live alone.」

％Ｂ
「Of course she does. Her family lives overseas, right?」
Natsuki
「I dunnooo～ You can't really be sure, you know? She might live with a lover or something.」

％Ｂ
「I wouldn't wanna find out that a classmate of mine lives with a lover in a place like this. I wouldn't know what to think of her when I see her next.」


Natsuki
「Doesn't stealing a girl away get you fired up?」
％Ｂ
「It does not.」
all
And also...
％Ｂ
「Hey, Segawa...」
Natsuki
「Hm? What is iiit?」
％Ｂ
「I dunno if my arm can take this much longer.」
We put some bottles in the basket when we got to the food aisle.

In case you're wondering, Segawa picked ginger ale for the soft drink, and wouldn't take no for an answer.\nEven though the cola was 20 yen cheaper...


And as a result...
The basket has about ten liters' worth of bottles and a pile of potatoes in it.
I feel like my right arm's about to tear off.
Natsuki
「Do your best, man.」
％Ｂ
「If you really wanna help, then at least hold half of the potatoes...」
Natsuki
「Honestly now. Fine, let's go check out already. It looks like Rikka's just about to go herself anyway.」

all
％Ｂ
「Oh, wait a second. I need to get curry roux first.」
I go over to the aisle with seasonings and dried goods and take a look at the options.
％Ｂ
「How spicy do we want it?」
I like it on the spicy side, but I have to take account of the girls too, so maybe somewhat milder?

Natsuki
「Why not just buy two different levels of spiciness? I hear mixing them turns out pretty good, and if people don't like it spicy then we can make a pot of just mild curry.」


％Ｂ
「Good idea. Let's do that.」
I toss a box of mild and a box of medium-hot curry roux into the basket and carry them to the register.

_00cutinBS
Natsuki
「She's brought her own bag... Rikka's looking more and more like a housewife.」
_00cutinBS
％Ｂ
「She's just saving money... And why didn't you bring any, Segawa? You knew about this, right?」

I didn't think I'd be charged for bags.
I tried to be as cheap as possible, so I have a single, completely full bag.
Natsuki
「I've never needed a bag 'cause I only ever buy juice or snacks here.」

％Ｂ
「I see... Oh!」
all
We step through the automatic door to see Narusawa standing there.
Rikka
「What do you want?」
She might've thought we were following her because we were watching her shop.

％Ｂ
「We didn't really need anything from you... Sorry. I was just curious.」

Rikka
「Curious? I was just doing some grocery shopping.」
％Ｂ
「I know, but...」
Natsuki
「Seeing a girl the same age shopping for groceries is a pretty lub-dub moment for a guy, you know?」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, it... I mean, no, Segawa.」
％Ｂ
「I'm seriously sorry.」
Rikka
「It's fine. It's not like I'm mad anyway.」
Rikka
「So you're out shopping together with Segawa-san
, Hino-kun

? If you're on a date, you two should focus more on enjoying yourselves than on caring about what I'm doing.」

We just ran into each other.
I guess... you could call this a date?
％Ｂ
「We just happened to run into each other.」
Natsuki
「Now that's mean. I waited for you to show up.」
％Ｂ
「That's 'cause you wanted me to hold your stuff.」
Natsuki
「That's not true, you know. Though I did feel like you'd do it without complaining.」

Natsuki
「That's not true, you know. Though I did feel like you'd do it without complaining.」

...She's got me figured out.
％Ｂ
「I guess... you could call this a date?」
Reasons aside, it was just the two of us shopping.
Natsuki
「That's true. I waited for 
Hino
him
, so I guess you could call it that.」

Natsuki
「You wanna join us on our date, Rikka?」
Rikka
「I'll have to decline.」
Natsuki
「Oh no. You've been rejected.」
％Ｂ
「Pretty sure I wasn't the one who got rejected just now.」
Rikka
「...I understand very well now that the two of you are very close.」
all
Narusawa sighs, looking bored. I should tell her what we're actually here for.
％Ｂ
「We're gonna go camping tomorrow. So we're here buying food.」

Rikka
「Camping?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. I joined this committee called the event organization committee.」
％Ｂ
「My job's to help out clubs that can't participate in the Tanabata Festival because they don't have enough members.」


Natsuki
「But we don't really know each other because we've only just met. So that's why we're going camping!」

Rikka
「I'm sorry. Maybe I'm stupid or something. I don't get the logic.」

％Ｂ
「Don't worry. I had no idea what was going on when it first came up either.」

As to why it has to be camping if we want to deepen friendships... That's something only Segawa knows.

Natsuki
「When you go camping, you all become better friends by cooking together and sitting around a bonfire.」

Natsuki
「Friendship! Fire! Cooking! That's camping!!」
％Ｂ
「...Sounds like the three main ingredients to a shounen manga.」
Natsuki
「Oh, right, Rikka. You come too!」
Natsuki
「And let me take photos of you! Your formidable stealth capabilities make it so I have the least photos of you out of anyone.」


Rikka
「It's for the graduation album, right? I don't need any photos of me.」
Natsuki
「You might be fine with it, but I'm not. Having any missing fragments of our memories would be a stain on my dignity as a grad-alb committee member.」


Rikka
「Sigh... Fine. Go ahead.」
Narusawa wearily turns to face Segawa.
Natsuki
「Hmm? What are you doing?」
Rikka
「Hurry up and take a photo.」
Natsuki
「Ngaaaaaahhh! Noooo! You don't get it! Photos aren't something you just take!」

Natsuki
「It's a moment, frozen in time, with the mood, the subject's impression, the ambiance just oozing out! It all combines into a single photograph!」

Natsuki
「I don't wanna just take a photo of the one person who ended up not being in a group photo and add it on later to the top-right corner or something! Get it!?」


Rikka
「Your analogy is impossible to understand.」
％Ｂ
「I also kinda feel like I get it, but I don't.」
Natsuki
「You definitely need to also go, Rikka. I'm gonna capture your best moments over and over, and teach you how incredible photos can be.」


Rikka
「I don't want to learn.」
％Ｂ
「Come on, Segawa. You shouldn't try to force her like that.」
all
％Ｂ
「Hey, Narusawa. You sure you don't wanna come with?」
Rikka
「Why would I? I don't have anything to do with the event organization committee, and I'm not in any clubs either.」

Hmm... She just doesn't seem interested.
Try a little harder.
I dunno if I should be too persistent...
％Ｂ
「We decided to do this in the first place 'cause we all don't know each other that well. The committee and club stuff comes second.」

％Ｂ
「I was hoping it'd be great if we could be better friends, since we sit next to each other and all. What do you think?」

Rikka
「...」
Rikka
「...I'm sorry.」
％Ｂ
「Okay. But you're always welcome to show up if you change your mind.」

It probably wouldn't be good to just keep hounding her.
％Ｂ
「Anyone's allowed to come. You can show up if you end up feeling like it.」
I tell her where and when we're meeting up tomorrow.
Rikka
「If I feel like it.」
％Ｂ
「That's good enough for me. Later then.」
Rikka
「Yes. Goodbye.」
She then walks away and enters a nearby pharmacy.
Natsuki
「She's gone. She should just come.」
％Ｂ
「I'm sure she has her reasons.」
Natsuki
「Reasons, huh... Well, I guess we can just have fun by ourselves.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. Oh, do you mind if I try to invite another person?」

Natsuki
「Sure you can. I'm all for walk-ins!」
％Ｂ
「Got it. I'll see if I can get in contact with her.」
Natsuki
「Okay, it's all you! I'm looking forward to tomorrow!」
all
％Ｂ
「Ahh... It's so heavy... I need to take a break...」
A nice wind blows through the park during the evening, probably because we're in a coastal area.
I'm just kinda walking around after finishing shopping, enjoying the cool air, when I spot a familiar silhouette.

_00cutinBS
％Ｂ
「Is that... Yukimura?」
She's crouched down by some shrubs... What's she doing?
_00cutinBS
I get a little closer.
I couldn't see it earlier because it was hidden in Yukimura's shadow, but there's a little ball of brown fur at her feet.

Touko
「Meow～ Good boy～ ...You're such a friendly cat, aren't you?」
She's petting a cat and cooing to it, apparently oblivious to my presence.
Touko
「How does it feel? Does it feel nice, meow～? I can give you some snacks if you're hungry～」

I think I'll just keep watching for a bit.
You probably don't get to see this side of Yukimura that often.
Touko
「Do you have a family? And are you a boy? Or are you a girl?」
Touko
「I see, I see, so you're a boy～ I hope you can find a bride soon～」

...She's having an actual conversation!
Can she understand cat language!?
Touko
「Hehe, you're so cute. You've got this nice, straight tail that looks pretty cool.」

Touko
「Ahaha, are you embarrassed? Your whiskers and nose are twitching, you know.」

Touko
「The round ones are cute, but slender ones like you are nice too. And you have these pretty tiger stripes too.」

Touko
「Meow, meow-meooow.」
...Wow, Yukimura.
She's totally just having a normal conversation with a cat.
Touko
「Ahahah! Here, heeere～ It feels good here, doesn't it? Meooow～」

Touko
「Meow meow meooow, meow, meooow. Hehe, you have little white socks on your feet. You're sooo cute.」

What a strange sight.
Yukimura and a cat before me, bathed in the light of the setting sun. It has this warm, nostalgic feel to it.

Touko
「Huh?」
％Ｂ
「Oh...」
I accidentally make a sound when I step forward without thinking.
The comfortable mood shatters when the cat and Yukimura notice me.
Touko
「...Were you watching just now?」
％Ｂ
「...My bad.」
Touko
「Spying on people isn't really nice, is it?」
％Ｂ
「I-I didn't mean to! It was just hard to call out to you, 'cause I feel like you don't act that way that much!」

Touko
「Well, it's fine. Not like I care what people think about me.」
％Ｂ
「...Sorry about that just now. Looks like the cat ran away too... I'm so sorry.」
Touko
「...Come on, don't apologize so seriously. You'll make me feel bad.」

Touko
「It's fine, I don't mind. Anyway, what are you doing here?」

％Ｂ
「I'm on the way back from shopping... Oh, right. I called you this morning. I left a message. Did you listen to it?」


Touko
「Nooope. I don't really know how to do it.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, come on... So you don't know anything about tomorrow then, right? It's a good thing I ran into you here, then.」

Touko
「About tomorrow? What are you talking about?」
％Ｂ
「We're all gonna go camping tomorrow. I was wondering if you wanted to come with.」

Touko
「...Why?」
％Ｂ
「Why...? 'Cause it'll be more fun with more people?」
I don't really understand why Yukimura asked.
Do I really need a reason to invite someone to hang out?
％Ｂ
「You can make some new friends, too. Everyone's great, so you don't need to worry or anything.」

Touko
「Mmm... I don't really feel like it. I've never done anything like that before, and I'm more the kinda person that just does whatever alone.」


％Ｂ
「We're all gonna make curry together. Don't knock it 'til you try it.」
Touko
「Huh. Well that certainly sounds like it could be fun.」
％Ｂ
「...You don't sound sincere about that at all.」
Touko
「Is that so? If you think so, then I guess that's how it is?」
％Ｂ
「It's not like you have something to do tomorrow, right?」
Touko
「Not really. You'll have to ask tomorrow's me if I'm doing anything.」

％Ｂ
「Just come with us, then. Segawa said she'd welcome walk-ins too.」

Touko
「Yeah, but still... I don't think I will, since I wouldn't be any kind of useful if I showed up. Later then.」


％Ｂ
「Agh, hey!? Yukimura!?」
all
She's gone.
She was kinda unapproachable about it, in a different way than Narusawa.
％Ｂ
「We'll be waiting for you tomorrow! Let me know, all right!?」
％Ｂ
「And... Yukimura never contacted me.」
I haven't gotten any mail or calls since then.
What should I do... Should I try it one more time?
Call her one more time.
Just keep waiting.
Let's try calling her just one more time.
_smh_st_01
_smh_st_btn01
_SMH_ST_01
I hope she picks up this time...
_smh_st_02
_smh_st_btn02
_smh_st_02
_smh_st_btn05
Touko
『Yes, hello?』
％Ｂ
「Oh, you picked up... Wait, were you asleep?」
Touko
『Mmm... Yeah, I was... So did you want something?』
％Ｂ
「Did you think about whether you'd come camping with us tomorrow?」
Touko
『...I already said I wouldn't, didn't I?』
％Ｂ
「The goal's to become better friends. You should come have fun with us. It won't just be making curry... Hey, Yukimura?」

Touko
『...Zzz... Zzz...』
...Dammit. She's asleep.
I doubt she'd remember if I kept talking like this anyway, so...
％Ｂ
「Good night. I'll call you again tomorrow morning.」
_smh_st_04
I'll try inviting her one last time tomorrow morning.
And if she still says no, then there's nothing more I can do.
％Ｂ
「I hope she decides to come...」
I already told her in person earlier, so it might not be a good thing to be too in her face about it.

％Ｂ
「I guess there's nothing else I can do. I'll just hope she's contacted me by morning.」

But still... is Yukimura the type that doesn't look at her phone on weekends?
I feel like normally you'd realize someone called when you see the notification or the voicemail.
％Ｂ
「...No, I doubt it.」
I think about when I exchanged contact information with Yukimura the other day.
I wouldn't be surprised if she didn't care about her mail or call history at that rate.
I guess I'll try contacting her one more time tomorrow morning.
And if she still says no, then there's nothing more I can do.
％Ｂ
「...I hope she comes.」
I open the window and lie spread-eagle on my bed.
It's still not exactly summer. The wind's cold.
％Ｂ
「I guess this wind'll get warmer too, soon enough.」
Once that happens, it'll be time for fans and air conditioning.
The stars sure are pretty.
I can see each and every one, way clearer than back in Kanagawa.

I can also just see way more of them in general.
I can understand why Ousaka's so obsessed with them.
I never really thought about it back when I was a kid... but the stars really are beautiful in this city.

Maybe I should ask Ousaka for some constellations to be on the lookout for over LIME.
Send her a message.
Figure it out myself.
Let's see...
【％Ｂ】「I'm looking at the stars #Nright now. Are there any #Nconstellations that are #Neasy to spot?」
I wonder if she'll respond...
【Sora】「The spring constellations are still visible at this time of year.」
Oh, there's a reply!
Spring? Can't say I really know of any spring constellations off the top of my head.
I guess I'll ask her how I should go about looking for them.
I start to type.
But then...
【Sora】「The Big Dipper is in the #Neastern sky. If you followwhere its handle points, #Nyou can see two first-#Nmagnitude stars next to #Neach other.」
She continues on before I could even ask.
Even I know the Big Dipper.
【Sora】「The first is Arcturus, #Nwhich is in Boötes, the #Nherdsman constellation. #NThe second is Spica, #Nwhich is in Virgo.」
【Sora】「If you look at those two, you can see another brightstar to the right.」
【Sora】「That one's Denebola, a #Nsecond-magnitude star in #NLeo. Arcturus, Spica, and Denebola make up a #Nformation called the #NSpring Triangle.」
More and more messages fly in, without so much as a pause to let me respond.
It looks like Ousaka's habit of becoming talkative when it comes to stars is just as apparent over LIME.

【Sora】「Arcturus and Spica are #Nalso called the Married #NStars, because of their #Norange and blue-white #Ncolor, respectively.
【Sora】「It's a bit hard to see, #Nbut you can see the #Nsecond-magnitude star in #NCanes Venatici near the #Nend of the Big Dipper's #Nhandle.」
【Sora】「If you connect that star #Nwith the Spring Triangle, it forms the Great #NDiamond.」
I look up at the stars while keeping track of the incoming messages... and I can actually see the especially bright stars that she's talking about, among the countless others.

No new messages. Looks like she's done.
I can finally respond.
【％Ｂ】「You're amazing, Ousaka.」
【Sora】「?」
【％Ｂ】「You don't just know about stars. You're good at #Nteaching others about #Nthem too.」
【Sora】「I'm happy you understood.」
【％Ｂ】「It was really easy to #Nunderstand. Just a #Nsecond.」
Let's see. Let me switch out of the LIME app for a second.
And then turn on the camera.
_starphoto
I wonder if it'll come out okay...
Hm... It's kinda hard to get the focus right when you take photos of the night sky.
$$smh_OpenCHK
...It's a little blurry... but I'm sure Ousaka will get it.

Let's see now, switch back to LIME...
Paste in the photo I just took...
【％Ｂ】「It's this, right?」
【％Ｂ】_st_0401
【Sora】_st_0310
I'll also reply with a stamp.
【％Ｂ】_st_0308
【％Ｂ】「Teach me more about the #Nstars sometime.」
【Sora】「No problem.」
【Sora】「It's a promise.」
Looks like she's back to the usual Ousaka now that we're not talking about stars.
I can't help but smile when I see the disparity in our conversation.

【％Ｂ】「Let's do it under a real #Nstarry sky together next #Ntime.」
【Sora】_st_0307
I flip my phone screen off after seeing Ousaka's reply stamp.
She really loves the stars.
She's good at teaching others about them, too. I hope we can find something that makes use of those parts of Ousaka's skillset for the Tanabata Festival.
I catch sight of that CD while I'm thinking.
It's the one I bought earlier today. Narusawa Meguru's classical music album.
No, I should try figuring it out myself first.
It's just a guess, but I have the feeling that Ousaka's looking up at the stars at her own place right now.
I wouldn't wanna bother her.
％Ｂ
「Let's see... Constellations are just what you get when you connect bright stars, right?」
％Ｂ
「There's an orangish one and a bluish one. Wonder what those ones are...」

％Ｂ
「...Wait, are those Mars and Mercury? Hm? Can you see those without a telescope?」

％Ｂ
「...Phew.」
I give up on thinking about it.
There's an entire sky's worth of stars before my eyes.
That's enough for me.
％Ｂ
「Time for a change of pace.」
％Ｂ
「How about I enjoy a bit of culture with some fine art appreciation?」
I place the CD in my stereo set.
Narusawa Meguru's debut album begins playing.
Chopin, Liszt, Rachmaninoff... Even I know their names, at least.

I'm not familiar enough to know pieces by their titles, but some of them sound familiar.

And the last track of disc two... the bonus track, is "A Fragment of Emotion."

$$smh_OpenCHK
％Ｂ
「...Maybe I should've been a little more insistent on having her come.」
I'm thinking back to when I talked to Narusawa today.
In the week that I've been at that school... Segawa's still pretty much the only person other than me that I've seen trying to talk to her.

I've never seen Narusawa try to talk to anyone either.
Segawa told me to keep on trying to strike up a conversation with her...

％Ｂ
「But even if she didn't, I'd still wanna be friends with her, since we got to know each other and all.」

I roll over in my bed.
The melodies from the CD seem different somehow from Narusawa's piano, but also similar... I think.

％Ｂ
「Oh... I should've asked.」
About whether Narusawa Meguru is Narusawa's sister or not.
％Ｂ
