It's a bright, sunny summer day.
A huge crowd of people files into the Shionagi Culture Hall beneath the clear blue sky.
％Ｂ
「Ohh... Wow. It's a full house.」
There are so many people in the waiting hall and lobby that I feel like they might not all fit in the concert hall.
Shuuichi
「There you are. I've been looking for you.」
％Ｂ
「Shuuichi. You came.」
Shuuichi
「Yeah. Segawa, Shinozaki, and the others are all over there.」
all
We sent out invitations for Rikka's first recital to everyone who's helped us out until now.
Azuma
「So the seats are ordered with seat number 1 in the very back. Which means I'm up pretty far in front...」

％Ｂ
「Oh, Teacher. You came too.」
Azuma
「How could I miss Rikka-chan's big moment in the spotlight? The other staff should be somewhere around here too.」
％Ｂ
「I'll go say hi to them before the recital begins.」
all
Shuuichi
「You seem happy.」
％Ｂ
「'Course I am.」

A recital is a symbol of a pianist's status.
The venue organized this event in the belief that Rikka would bring in an audience all on her own.

I'm as happy as I would be if it were me up on stage. Because I've been watching over all of Rikka's efforts all this time.

The concert hall's lights dim, and the stage lights up.
Rikka comes out in her dress, bows to the audience, and begins her performance.

It's an all-Tchaikovsky program.
It's a callback to the contest where she won first place in the piano section, and the grand prize.

There's no place for words once she begins playing.
Rikka speaks to the audience through the piano, and the audience answers her with applause.
It's an extravagant time that flows gently and comfortably alongside her melody―
After playing through the entire program, Rikka stands up and exits the stage.

Unending applause.
It's the signal for an encore.
Rikka re-emerges and begins her encore performance.
But the applause still doesn't end after that.
Rikka re-emerges once more, and bows to the audience without playing. She exits the stage once more.

The applause still continues.
Rikka walks back onto the stage.
She's holding a microphone.
It's not every day a pianist speaks to the audience during a recital.
Rikka
「Thank you all very much for attending my very first recital today.」

Rikka
「I think I may be the one most surprised that this many people have come to listen to my performance.」

Rikka
「I am able to stand here today... I am able to do what I am now doing because of all of the many people who have supported me.」

Rikka
「There was a period of time when I, after being discouraged, had given up on becoming a professional pianist.」
Rikka
「On a day a little cooler than today... A day when summer was only just beginning. I met a certain man on such a day. The man who would become my beloved husband.」


Rikka
「Meeting him greatly changed my fate. The friends I made during my years as a student and the memories I made then still live on as an irreplaceable part of my sound today.」

Rikka
「It is thanks to them that I was able to decide to pursue my dreams once more.」

Rikka
「In my discouragement, I found something truly important, and was able to grow greatly as a pianist.」

Rikka
「As someone who had been bemoaning a lack of talent, I found that that discouragement was the greatest gift I could have possibly received. I now truly believe so from the bottom of my heart.」

Rikka
「I have received guidance from many kind people, including my mother, my father, Aoyagi-sensei, and Schiele-sensei. Thank you all so very much.」
Rikka
「Meguru, Natsuki, Marika, Sora, Misa, Touko, Nirasawa-kun, Ishizuka-san, Asakura-san―」

She lists off the names of everyone she's indebted to.
She packs her feelings into each and every name.
The list goes on and on, a name for every month, every year of her efforts.
Rikka
「―Thank you very much for coming today. Thank you very much for supporting me.」

Rikka
「And the person I love more than anyone else, who always supports me from by my side―」

Rikka
「The crystallization of Ryousuke's and my love is swiftly growing within my belly.」

Rikka
「The crystallization of our love is swiftly growing within my belly」

―That's right. Rikka's intuition was exactly right back then. My child is currently in her belly.

Rikka
「I am very happy right now. I have been allowed to walk a very wonderful path in life. My world is overflowing with happiness.」


Rikka
「"I am glad I did not give up on becoming a pianist"... I am living out a life in which I can believe that from the very bottom of my heart.」

Rikka
「I am still inexperienced both as a pianist and as a mother, but I hope you will all continue to watch over me warmly in the future.」

She bows, and the concert hall fills with applause.
Rikka
「My final piece is one with which I would like to express my gratitude to him, to our future children... and to everyone who has supported me.」


Rikka
「Please allow me to play this piece for you.」
Rikka bows again, to be greeted by thunderous applause.
Rikka
「...」
She closes her eyes. She slowly takes deep, deep breaths.

％Ｂ
「Oh...!」
It's...
The piece Rikka's been putting together all this time.
It's finally complete.
Each and every piece of the cascade of sound is one of Rikka's footsteps along her path.
The time she spent with us.
Her memories of everyone.
Happiness, sadness, joy, pain... all become bliss.

Her smile says everything.
This is her story.
The story of a ridiculously awkward, incredibly kind, demanding crybaby who gets lonely all too easily.

She sought out connections―
She took our hands, and was able to form a ring. That's the kind of story this is.

A very happy... and warm sound.

This is her...
Communicating all of herself.
Her melody resonates.
Far, far away, to the rest of the world―
