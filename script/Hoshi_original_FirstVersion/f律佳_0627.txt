I sit down at my seat and wait, my heart pounding.
I'm gonna get to see Narusawa for the first time in a while today.
I know for sure because she contacted me this morning.
Even I know I must be in it deep if I consider two days "a while," but it really feels like I've been waiting forever.

And so I ended up getting to school a lot earlier than usual today.
％Ｂ
「Oh!」
The person I've been waiting for walks in, with her silky black hair waving behind her.

Rikka
「Oh... Hehe.」
She smiles gently as soon as our eyes meet.
And that's when I know coming to school today was worth it. More than worth it.
％Ｂ
「Morning.」
I felt like it would've been weird to mention her feeling better.
Rikka
「Good morning.」
An incredibly pretty and kind smile.
It's a weapon of mass destruction. I stop thinking for an instant.
％Ｂ
「Oh, right. Here, these are the notes for the stuff we covered while you were out.」
％Ｂ
「I tried to write neatly, but let me know if there's anything you can't read.」
I hand her a few notebooks.
Rikka
「Thank you. I'll be borrowing these for a bit, then.」
She accepts them, and smiles again.
Narusawa's been smiling a lot more lately, and my heart's been pounding a lot more lately too.
Rikka
「...」
She's staring at my face for some reason.
I think my blood might start boiling from my temperature spiking upward.
％Ｂ
「Wh-What? Agh, I don't have bed hair or anything, do I!?」
I thought I was being pretty vigilant, but...
Rikka
「Oh, no. That's not why! Umm... Well...」
Rikka
「...Nothing.」
％Ｂ
「Seeing you avert your eyes as you say is only making me more curious, miss.」
Rikka
「It's really nothing. Don't worry about it.」
all
She turns back to her desk and starts copying my notes.
I am sooooooooooooooooo curiooooouss!!
I sprint out from the classroom, to the bathroom.
％Ｂ
「...Hm... Hmm...?」
...There's nothing particularly weird about how I look.
％Ｂ
「Oh... Crap.」
The bell rings for lunch break, and that's when I realize that I've forgotten to buy lunch for today.

Not good, I'm gonna have Narusawa's music lessons again starting today too...

％Ｂ
「My bad, Narusawa. I'm gonna go buy lunch real quick, so could you go to the music classroom ahead and―」

Rikka
「...」
She stares at me intensely.
It makes for a nice scene to have a pretty girl glaring at you, but it's also really intimidating.
％Ｂ
「Did I perhaps do something to anger you?」
Rikka
「What? Why do you ask?」
％Ｂ
「'Cause you look really intense.」
Rikka
「N-No, I'm not angry. This is... um... because I was nervous...」
％Ｂ
「Nervous?」
Rikka
「You... didn't buy lunch today, right?」
％Ｂ
「Oh, yeah. That's why I was gonna go buy some right now...」
Rikka
「...I'm glad. I was so focused on making it that I completely forgot to ask you...」

Rikka
「Let's go to the music classroom.」
％Ｂ
「Huh? But my lunch...」
Rikka
「You won't need to worry about that.」
She kinda forcefully leads me to the music room.
Rikka
「...Here.」
％Ｂ
「...」
She looks up at me and blushes as she holds out something. It's what looks like an elliptical box, wrapped in cute-looking fabric.

Judging by the context and from what I can tell about what she's holding out to me, the object before me must be what is commonly known as a "lunchbox."

I understand, but I can't comprehend.
Rikka
「I thought I could thank you for back when you made the rice porridge for me. Because you seemed jealous of Nirasawa-kun before when he had one.」


％Ｂ
「Wha, oh... Ohh～」
I'm more happy that she remembered something so trivial than I am surprised.

Rikka
「...Maybe you don't need it?」
Her face falls. Her expression is worried, and sad.
％Ｂ
「I do! I need it! I would love to have it! Thank you so very much!」

I accept it with both hands, as if formally accepting a business card.
Rikka
「Hehe, you're being too formal. It's nothing too fancy, so I'd like it if you didn't expect much.」

％Ｂ
「Oh, no! I feel like it'd be a waste to eat a handmade lunchbox from you. I almost wanna use it to decorate my room.」
Rikka
「Geez, there wouldn't be any point in making it if you don't eat it. I tried putting in as much as I could think of that a boy might like. I hope the seasoning's to your tastes too.」


％Ｂ
「If you made it, then anything's delicious.」
Rikka
「I hope I can hear you say the same thing after you eat it. Hehe.」
％Ｂ
「Then you mind if I dig in?」
Rikka
「Go ahead. Enjoy.」
all
I sit down next to her and unwrap the lunchbox.
％Ｂ
「Ohh, this is crazy!」
The words come out on reflex.
Fried chicken, mini ground beef steaks, bacon-wrapped asparagus... The contents are pretty meat-heavy.

But there are lots of vegetables worked in too, and the vivid red, yellow, and green is a real feast for the eyes.

Aaahhh... Just thinking about how Narusawa made this for me's getting me emotional!

％Ｂ
「Let's eat, then.」
I grab chopsticks.
％Ｂ
「Ngh, ngh... Gulp! This fried chicken tastes amazing!」
Rikka
「It isn't that special. I seasoned the meat and fried it normally. Do you like fried chicken?」
％Ｂ
「I like meat dishes in general, like ground beef steak and ginger pork.」

％Ｂ
「Khhh～! ...This fried egg's just a bit sweet, and so fluffy. I think I might like this even more than my mom's!」
Rikka
「Hehe...」
I look up from the food to see her watching me with a smile on her face.

Her expression nearly makes me choke on the food I was eating. I somehow manage to swallow it down.
Rikka
「Oh... I'm sorry. It's hard to eat when I'm watching, isn't it?」
％Ｂ
「No, it's fine. I was just thinking about how something like this happened before.」

Back when I ate those muffins at her place.
Rikka
「I was just thinking you really look like you're enjoying it. Seeing you that happy makes cooking it all worth it.」

％Ｂ
「'Cause I really am enjoying it.」
all
And I give the exact same uninteresting answer.
I can't just say that.
I wanna tell her more about how I really feel.
％Ｂ
「...A-And it's food that you made for me, so I think it tastes even better 'cause of that.」

I-I said it...! I've said it...!
It was pretty embarrassing and to be honest I think my voice cracked a bit, but I did manage to spit out how I felt.

Rikka
「...」
％Ｂ
「Narusawa?」
Rikka
「...Okay... Thank you...」
She opens and closes her mouth noiselessly, and then gives a short response.
She swiftly goes red all the way up to the top of her head.

％Ｂ
「A-Ahaha. Your food's seriously amazing. You put a ton of effort into this. How long did this take you?」


Narusawa's just too cute. I need to change the subject, or else I'm gonna end up confessing to her on accident at this rate.

Confessing to her while I'm throwing food down my gullet would just be too dumb. I wanna avoid that.

Rikka
「...It wasn't that much work. I just woke up a little earlier... In fact, I had so much fun making it that it was even easier than usual...」


％Ｂ
「O-Oh, really.」
Is she just talking about making the lunch?
Or maybe it was 'cause she was thinking about me... Is that too conceited of me to think that?

Rikka
「Oh, I know. Do you have any plans this weekend?」
％Ｂ
「Not really. What's up?」
Rikka
「Would you like to come practice music at my house? You weren't able to practice these past few days because I stayed home from school.」

Practicing music at Narusawa's...
So that means I'll get to be together with her even on the weekend.
％Ｂ
「I'd love to, as long as you're okay with it.」
Rikka
「Hehe. I wouldn't say you can't after inviting you. What time works best for you?」
We figure out when I'll be coming over.
...It's weird. I feel lots of different things welling up in my chest. I'm starting to feel full.\n\r

Even though I've got a lunch that Narusawa made for me right here in front of me.
But every single bite of Narusawa's cooking is still delicious.
