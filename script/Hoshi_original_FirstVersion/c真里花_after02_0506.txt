Marika
「Wow, it's so heavy!」
Marika looks shocked when she picks up the savings box.
％Ｂ
「Well it's been half a year since then. I've saved up a lot over the days.」

Marika
「Are they all 500-yen coins?」
％Ｂ
「They're not, but there should be a lot of them in there. I think there's a few bills in there too.」

I made a new account at the bank to save up too.
Our ceremony's not going to be particularly lavish, so I'm pretty sure I've got plenty enough funds now.

Marika
「You've been budgeting this whole time, after all～ Hehe... It's so close.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, it really is.」
We've more or less decided on the date too.
It's going to be sometime at the beginning of August.
Things are going to start getting really busy now that we're only three months away.
Marika
「Oh, speaking of which... Do you have the time to look at dresses with me?」
％Ｂ
「Next week, was it?」
Marika
「Yeah. If you're busy with work, I can go with my mom...」
％Ｂ
「No, I'll go too. It'd be a waste if I only got to see you all pretty in your dress for the few hours of the ceremony.」

％Ｂ
「Let's find the best dress for you together.」
Marika
「Okay! I'll try on lots of dresses for you!」
％Ｂ
「I'm looking forward to it.」
Marika
「We'll need to decide on invitations, and figure out the seating... Oh, and we'll need to decide on who's going to make speeches and ask them to do it. And then we'll need to do guest gifts...」


％Ｂ
「There's no end to the stuff we need to do, huh?」
And Marika's even apparently attending some kind of cooking class too now. She seems way busier than I am.\n\r

She apparently wants to bake cookies as guest gifts.
％Ｂ
「Well, there's nothing for us to do today, so let's relax for once.」
Marika
「You're right. We definitely need to take breaks.」
We've already been talking about going out together someplace for a day during a long weekend.

％Ｂ
「We could've gone on a trip or something if we had the money...」
Marika
「But we need to save for now. So...」

％Ｂ
「Yeah!」
We've already decided on where we're going.
And that would be...
Marika
「Let's go hiking!」
Marika
「We're heeere!」
Marika yells out beneath the refreshing blue sky.
It's the familiar sight of the Shionagi City campground.
We haven't been here in a while, but nothing's really changed.
all
％Ｂ
「There's a lot of people here for the long weekend.」
There are various people all relaxing and enjoying the early afternoon.
Families playing with pets and flirting couples.
It just feels nice to be here.
Marika
「It's totally different from that first time we came here in high school. We had the place to ourselves back then.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, 'cause it was the off-season. But remember how it was crazy crowded the next year?」

Marika
「Yeah, because it was summer break. We stayed the night that time, right? ...The stars were so pretty～」

We reminisce over good memories.
％Ｂ
「This really kinda takes me back.」
Marika
「Yeah, same for me. It was so fun.」
Marika smiles at the nostalgic location.
And I feel the same way.
％Ｂ
「It's so weird. I didn't think things would end up this way back then.」

Marika
「I know, right～ We had only just met again back then... and we were just friends.」

％Ｂ
「But now we're, well...」
Marika
「Mhm... Yeah.」
Marika
「We're... going to be together.」
％Ｂ
「...Yeah.」
It's kinda embarrassing to say it out loud.
The backs of our hands touch.
Marika
「Oh...」
I grab her hand tight.
Marika goes red for a second...
Marika
「Ehe...」
And then her face melts into a smile.
Marika
「Oh, there's some space over there. Let's put down the picnic blanket♪」
％Ｂ
「Oh? You're right. Let's set up camp, then.」
Marika
「Yeah! This is our spot, then. So let's put down the...」

％Ｂ
「No, wait a second.」
Marika
「Huh?」
％Ｂ
「First we need to thoroughly check the ground for bumps.」

％Ｂ
「And if there's any big rocks or anything, we need to move them. It'd hurt when we sat on them otherwise.」

Marika
「You're sooo smart～! I'll help out too, then.」

％Ｂ
「Oh no, this is a man's job. You could get hurt if there's any glass shards or anything.」

all
％Ｂ
「And it'll be over real quick. Hup... Hoh, hoh, hoh...」

Marika
「Wow, you're right～ It really was quick!」
％Ｂ
「It's all good now. Let's lay down the sheet...」

Marika
「Oh, I'll hold the other side～」
all
We lay down the picnic blanket together.
We put down our bags on top so it won't get blown away by the wind.
％Ｂ
「All right, setup complete! C'mon, try sitting.」

Marika
「Okaaay... Wow...! The ground's so soft～!」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, the grass is pretty long. Ooohh... You're right, this is soft. I feel like you could bounce on this.」


Marika
「Ahahaha... Like this, maybe～」
She bounces down stiffly with her butt still on the sheet.
Marika
「Oh, b-buuut... This position's a bit～」
And she turns red for some reason.
％Ｂ
「What's wrong?」
Marika
「Umm... I'm sitting directly on the ground... s-so if I let my guard down too much... Umm... You might be able to see my panties...」


％Ｂ
「Oh～ ...No, I think you don't need to worry about that? I don't really think you could've seen them earlier.」


Marika
「That might be true, but... I don't think it's okay～」
Marika
「Since my body doesn't belong to just me anymore...」
％Ｂ
「Well, uh...」
Her saying it that way makes me blush a bit.
But I'm also happy that she's thinking about it that way.
％Ｂ
「Okay, then let's put up a thorough defense! I brought another blanket to drape over our laps if we wanted. You can cover your lower body with this.」


％Ｂ
「Plus, it's still a bit chilly this time of year.」
Marika
「Wow～ You're amazing! Thanks!」
She quickly wraps the blanket around her lap.
And then she quietly sits down on the picnic blanket.
Marika
「Then... would you like to eat lunch right away?」
％Ｂ
「Oh yeah, for sure! This place takes a while to get to, so I'm super hungry.」

Marika
「Then, umm... It may not be much, but...」
She hesitantly takes out a big boxed lunch from inside a bag.

％Ｂ
「Oh come on. Your boxed lunches are totally a big deal. They're the best-tasting thing in the world.」

Marika
「I-I think... that's saying a bit too much～」
Marika
「But I tried my hardest to make it.」
％Ｂ
「Then give it here, tall and proud.」
Marika
「Y-Yes! Umm... Here's the boxed lunch I packed all of my heart into for you～」

She slowly holds it out to me.
Marika
「I would be very happy... if you liked it...」
％Ｂ
「Thanks, Marika. I know it's gonna be good. There's no doubt.」

Marika
「Ahaha... You haven't even eaten it yet. But it'd be nice if you thought that way about it.」

％Ｂ
「Then let's dig in!」
Marika
「Yes, please do.」
all
We put our hands together and open our lunchboxes.
％Ｂ
「Whoaaaa... Th-This is amazing...」

Marika
「Whaaat? I think it's normal.」
％Ｂ
「No, it's amazing in a normal way...」
Marika's boxed lunch is a normal boxed lunch.
Molded rice balls, fried chicken, rolled egg, potato salad, broccoli, and mini tomatoes...

But it feels incredibly extravagant.
％Ｂ
「It's the decorations, maybe? I don't think I've ever seen such a delicious-looking boxed lunch...」

Marika
「A-Ahaha, I think you're overreacting～」
％Ｂ
「No, this is number one for sure.」
Marika
「But hearing you say that makes all my work this morning worth it. I had my mom check it too, and got her seal of approval.」

％Ｂ
「Then there's no doubt.」
Marika
「Yeah. I wanted you to eat something tasty. So what do you think about the taste?」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, I'll start with the egg... Ohhh, it's great!」

Marika
「It might just look like regular rolled fried egg, but it's actually seasoned. I hope it's nice and fragrant.」

％Ｂ
「This tastes crazy good. And this fried chicken's got this kinda richness to it too... Is this expensive meat or something?」


Marika
「Too bad, it's thigh meat that was on sale～」
Marika
「But I had it marinating in a soy sauce mix since last night. It makes it more savory while removing any bad smells.」

％Ｂ
「There's so much work that goes into each and every thing...」
Marika
「And also～ I'm really proud of the kinpira too.」
％Ｂ
「This? Oh yeah, the flavoring's great... Wait, Marika. You haven't been eating at all.」

Marika
「A-Ahaha～ ...You're right.」
Marika
「I just can't help but watch when people are eating. Especially when they're enjoying their food...」

％Ｂ
「Then I wanna watch you eat too.」
Marika
「Oh, okay... Then I'll have some of the kinpira too...」
％Ｂ
「Here. Enjoy.」
I grab some of the kinpira and hold it out toward her mouth.
Marika
「Ehehe～ ...It's kind of embarrassing.」
％Ｂ
「What are you saying at this point? Especially since we're gonna...」

Marika
「Y-Yeah, you're right... I can't say stuff like that. Yep, yep... I shouldn't be embarrassed anymore.」

％Ｂ
「That's right. Just pop it into your mouth.」
Marika
「Then I'll have some～ ...Amh, amh...」

Marika
「Oh, it's good～! It's flavored really well～」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, it's got kind of a nostalgic taste to it.」
Marika
「Does your family flavor theirs the same way?」
Marika
「Does your family flavor theirs the same way?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. Probably 'cause they're from Shionagi too.」
Marika
「Oh really～ I have to ask about making miso soup sometime... You like it a little on the stronger side, right?」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, I guess if I had to choose.」
Marika
「What kind of miso do they use?」
％Ｂ
「Uhh... I'm pretty sure it's red miso.」
Marika
「Maybe it's a mixed miso～? I need to remember this!」
She's noting down my tastes.
Seeing her do that makes my heart throb. I feel so incredibly content.

all
Marika
「Ahhh～ ...This is paradise～」
We lean against each other after eating.
Marika brings her shoulder against mine, and I accept her weight.
Marika
「Please allow me to borrow the use of your shoulder～」
％Ｂ
「Sure thing. You can use it as much as you want.」
Marika
「I am depending on you, My lord...」
％Ｂ
「Don't you think that's kinda too formal?」
Marika
「Whaaat? Then what should I say? Like... "My husband"?」

％Ｂ
「Just call me what you always do.」
Marika
「Oh, right～ You're right. Ahaha... There's no need to go out of my way to change it.」

％Ｂ
「But you know, just talking like this is pretty fun too, isn't it?」
Marika
「Yeah. It's so exciting discussing our wedding ceremony and stuff.」

％Ｂ
「I'm looking forward to looking at the dresses next week too.」
Marika
「Ehehe, me too. Oh, right. I need to make sure I don't forget the innerwear...」

％Ｂ
「Hm? What's innerwear?」
Marika
「Bridal innerwear. It's underwear for when you wear a wedding dress. You have to buy it especially for this.」


％Ｂ
「Huh, I didn't know they had stuff like that. So it's specifically for wedding dresses?」
Marika
「You know how your figure's more visible in those? So it's to make sure you look better for that, too.」


％Ｂ
「Hmm... Are we gonna look through those too?」
Marika
「What? We'll just look at those... I'm not going to show you me wearing them, you know～」
％Ｂ
「What!? Really...」
Marika
「Why are you so surprised? It's underwear...」

％Ｂ
「I know... but I see your underwear all the time.」

Marika
「It-It's different! You only wear bridal innerwear when you're wearing a wedding dress.」


％Ｂ
「I won't get to see it, then? That's a shame.」
Marika
「That's right, you'll have to be okay with that. Bridal innerwear's like supplementary underwear anyway, so I don't think it'd be interesting to see either.」


％Ｂ
「Mmm～ I'm sure it'd be cute, though.」
Marika
「A-Ahaha～」
％Ｂ
「But thinking about it, there's still a lot to do. We need to write the invitations, and we haven't figured out where we're living yet, and we need to get furniture together too...」


Marika
「Yeah, there really is a lot. But for today...」
％Ｂ
「...Yeah. You're right. Let's just take it easy.」

Marika
「Yeah!」
