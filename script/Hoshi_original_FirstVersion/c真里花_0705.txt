Saturday―
The mood in the classroom is solemn. This is where the Saturday meet-up is.
Everyone's diligently turned toward their desks.
I think this'll be able to get me to focus.
I say hello to the teacher in charge, pick a random seat, and sit down.
％Ｂ
「Okay! Time to focus!」
I didn't end up getting much done at home.
I couldn't stop thinking of unnecessary things while I was studying.
I kept checking LIME over and over.
And so I've ended up with only the weekend left to study.

I was wary when I came here, but this sharp tension looks like it'll be just the thing to help me concentrate.

％Ｂ
「...Hm?」
I thought the guy next to me looked familiar. It's Shuuichi.

Shuuichi
「Hm? Oh, it's you.」
％Ｂ
「Right, I forgot you weren't doing so hot for tests.」
Shuuichi
「That goes for both of us now that we're both here. I bet you came here because you couldn't focus.」

％Ｂ
「H-How'd you know?」
He guessed exactly right.
Shuuichi
「It's easy to tell why you can't focus.」
％Ｂ
「Wha...」
I'm stuck speechless as he smirks knowingly.
What does he know? It can't be...
Shuuichi
「I bet you can't even study, 'cause the sight of Okihara-senpai and Shinozaki in their swimsuits is burnt into your retinas.」

％Ｂ
「...What? Swimsuits?」
Shuuichi
「Don't bother playing dumb. I know how you feel! Getting caught up over those kinds of carnal thoughts is just a part of being a man.」

Shuuichi
「I know I've gotten plenty crazed myself in the past, imagining beach dates with Kaori-san...」

％Ｂ
「No, no, no. We're not the same. It wasn't 'cause of some impure reason like that.」

Shuuichi
「Well isn't that some attitude? Here I am, letting you know that I understand your pain and suffering, and that's what I get?」

％Ｂ
「Don't act like you understand. And besides, you...!」

all
Teacher A
「You there. If you're not going to study, then leave.」
％Ｂ
「Uh... I-I'm sorry.」
I got yelled at.
I forgot about my surroundings and ended up getting pulled along by Shuuichi...
Shuuichi
「Honestly. What to do with you?」
Not good. Getting aggravated with this idiot's only gonna further reduce the time for me to study.\n\r

Exams start this week. I need to focus.
all
I'd be an embarrassment to Shinozaki if I failed.
Shinozaki...
I wonder if she's studying right now...
No, maybe she's taking a short break...
％Ｂ
「...Gasp!」
I was spacing out again!
％Ｂ
「Crap! Focus!!」
Shuuichi
「...Hmph.」
％Ｂ
「Don't laugh at me!」

％Ｂ
「Ughhh, I'm tired.」
Shuuichi
「Looks like you managed to focus after all.」
％Ｂ
「I pull through in the clutch.」
I got through a lot thanks to today.
I'm gonna keep going like this and start finishing this off once I get home.
Shuuichi
「You going to go home right away and keep going?」
％Ｂ
「'Course. You're not gonna do that?」
Shuuichi
「I'm...」
all
And that's when a red sports car comes revving up to us.
It stops right in front of us.
I'm pretty sure that car's...
Kaori
「Thanks for waiting, Shuuichi!」
％Ｂ
「...I knew it.」
Shuuichi
「I actually just got done. You've always got such good timing, Kaori.」

Kaori
「I could just feel that you finished studying～」
Shuuichi
「It's a miracle, I guess.」
Kaori
「Kyaaaahh, no waaay～! C'mon, Shuuichi, hurry and get on♪」

Shuuichi
「Okay. Good luck studying, then.」

all
％Ｂ
「...What a perfect idiot couple.」
And yet what is this defeat I feel within me?
Shinozaki's face suddenly comes to mind again.
％Ｂ
「...Now's fine, right? I did a lot today already.」
I guess... I'll call her.
Calling her wouldn't be weird, right?
％Ｂ
「...All right!」
Wait. This isn't something I need to psych myself up over.
I pull out my phone and call Shinozaki's number.

Marika
『Hello?』
％Ｂ
「H-Hello? It's me.」
I'm suddenly nervous when I hear her voice. My own voice cracks.

Marika
『Oh, hi～ Is something the matter?』
％Ｂ
「No, nothing really... Oh, I just got out of the Saturday meet-up.」

Marika
『Oh, you went to the meet-up?』
％Ｂ
「Y-Yeah, I did! Since you told me about it. And I was kinda behind on my studying.」


Marika
『That's to be expected, you only just transferred in. Did it go well?』

％Ｂ
「Yeah, thanks to you. I'm glad you told me about it.」

Marika
『Really? I'm glad I was useful～』
％Ｂ
「You totally were! You were super useful!」
Marika
『It's not that big of a deal～』
I can hear her giggling into my ear.
It's enough to make me happy all on its own.
Even though all I'm doing is hearing her voice.
Marika
『Oh, but is your foot okay? Don't overexert yourself, okay?』
％Ｂ
「I'm fine, I'm...」
Clunk!
％Ｂ
「Agh...!!」
My foot catches on something while I'm walking and talking, and I lose my balance.\n\r

I frantically thrust my crutch out and stop myself.
％Ｂ
「Phew. That was close.」
Marika
『Wh-What happened? Are you okay?』
％Ｂ
「I'm fine, I'm fine. I just tripped a little.」
Marika
『Geeeez, be careful, okay? I would've come with you to the Saturday meet-up if you told me you were going. I could've walked you there and back that way...』


％Ｂ
「It's fine, I'm not a kid.」
That, and I wouldn't have been able to focus with her around.
％Ｂ
「A...Anyway, wanna go have fun someplace once exams are over?」

I was trying to be casual about it, but I couldn't stop my voice from shaking a bit.
That didn't sound weird, did it?
Marika
『Oh, I like that idea～ Let's do it♪』
She sounds happy.
I'm instantly in a better mood once she agrees.
Marika
『Now I'm excited! I'll have to do my best on my exams!』
％Ｂ
「Yeah, it's getting me motivated too. Where do you wanna go, then?」

Marika
『Hmm, I wonder where would be good. We went to the mountains for camping before, so maybe the beach?』

Marika
『But going to the movies or the amusement park could be nice too... Mmm, there's so many options～』

％Ｂ
「You can take your time thinking it over. Doesn't matter where we go. Just have something in mind by the time exams are over.」

Marika
『Yeah, I'll think about it. But I'll have to make sure I don't spend all of my studying time thinking about that!』


％Ｂ
「Ahaha, same here. We'll have to work hard.」

I'm genuinely motivated now, from the bottom of my heart.
Is it normal to get this cheerful about making plans to hang out together?

％Ｂ
「Uh, well... I guess that's about all I had to say. Anyway, we should probably hang up.」

Marika
『Okay. Be careful on the way home.』
％Ｂ
「Thanks. Anyway...」
Marika
『Yeah...』
％Ｂ
「...」
Marika
『...』
And yet neither of us hangs up.
We can't bring ourselves to hang up because we don't want to stop talking.
％Ｂ
「...Aren't you gonna hang up?」
Marika
『Whaaat? You hang up first.』
％Ｂ
「I kinda can't do it for some reason. Okay. Then let's both hang up after a countdown.」

Marika
『Oh, I like that idea.』
％Ｂ
「Here goes, then. 3, 2, 1...」
％Ｂ
「...」
Marika
『...』
％Ｂ
「Huh? Hello?」
Marika
『Huh? It's still connected?』
％Ｂ
「Yeah, it is. Why didn't you hang up?」
Marika
『Whaaat? Same for you. The call's never going to end at this rate～』

％Ｂ
「Seriously, right? Ahahaha...」
A smile breaks out on my lips, and I can't stop myself from laughing.
I can hear Shinozaki laughing along on the other end of the line.
％Ｂ
「Anyway, we seriously gotta stop sometime, so I'm really gonna hang up now.」
Marika
『Yeah, me too. Oh, one last thing...』

％Ｂ
「What?」
Marika
『Good luck with studying.』
One last pleasant encouragement.

「All right, I'm gonna do it... I'm gonna study!」
