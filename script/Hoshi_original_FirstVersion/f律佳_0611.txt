「Ouchhh... Aw man, it's all red.」
I rub my swollen left arm.
It still stings a bit, but it's minor enough that it should heal with time.

％Ｂ
「Was fun though. It was like I was a kid again.」
I was playing futsal with Shuuichi and some others for lunch break.
I haven't moved around like that in a long time. My muscles feel comfortably tired.

I'm taking a cool-down stroll before classes begin again for the afternoon.

％Ｂ
「Oh...」
_00cutinBS
I spot someone familiar as I pass by the second music classroom.
She's sitting on the piano bench, staring out the window.

I wonder if she's considered my invitation to join the committee.
Maybe it's about time for me to bring it up again.

％Ｂ
「Narusawa. Nothing to do, eh?」
Rikka
「Isn't that a bit rude to say that as soon as you walk in?」
％Ｂ
「But I'm right, aren't I?」
Rikka
「Yes, you are. I wasn't running around all over the place for lunch break unlike you.」
％Ｂ
「Huh?」
Rikka
「I could see down to the grounds from here. You were playing soccer with your friends, weren't you?」

％Ｂ
「Not soccer. Futsal.」
Rikka
「...? What's the difference?」
％Ｂ
「Well first off, the number of players is different. The rules are different too. Kinda hard to explain everything at once.」

％Ｂ
「I know? Wanna try playing with us sometime?」
Rikka
「I'll have to decline.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, right. Yeah, 'cause you're wearing a skirt...」
My face goes hot as I recall Segawa's pantyshot.
Rikka
「...What are you making a face like that for? Are you imagining my skirt getting pulled up or something?」

％Ｂ
「N-No... Haha.」
Rikka
「I doubt you'd be able to find a woman that would kick high enough for that to happen. Only in your imagination.」

％Ｂ
「Hahaha, yeah, you're right.」
Little do you know that you're very familiar with someone who's already done exactly that...
Narusawa sighs and directs her gaze slightly lower.
Rikka
「Oh... Your button's gone...」
％Ｂ
「Hm? Oh, you're right. Maybe it fell off when Shuuichi and I were horsing around earlier.」
The button on my jacket at around my lower-chest level's gone, leaving only a piece of string behind.
％Ｂ
「I should probably fix that, huh? It looks ridiculous... But I don't have any buttons or sewing supplies at home...」

Those are still at the Kanagawa house, since Mom's the only person who ever used them.

％Ｂ
「Hmm～ ...What should I do...?」
Rikka
「Shall I sew one on, then?」
％Ｂ
「...What?」
Rikka
「You wouldn't want it to stay that way forever, would you?」
％Ｂ
「R-Right... No, I wouldn't. But are you sure?」
Rikka
「I wouldn't offer my help if I wasn't sure. Just wait. I'll go get a sewing set from the classroom.」

％Ｂ
「It's all right, I'll go get it.」
Rikka
「...Are you planning on going through my bag?」
She levels a hard stare at me.
％Ｂ
「Oh, sorry! I didn't mean it that way! I just―」
Rikka
「Hehe, I know.」
all
She smiles a bit and leaves.
％Ｂ
「Sigh...」
That "I know," with that cute smile. That's not fair.
It made my heart go crazy...
％Ｂ
「Huh... You're pretty good at sewing. I'm jealous.」
Rikka
「Anyone can do this much once they get used to it.」
She passes a white thread through my jacket with practiced ease as she talks.
Rikka
「I picked a button that matched the other buttons as much as possible, but this is still a patch job.」

Rikka
「You should ask the school to fix it properly, or find the same button at a store and replace it afterward.」

％Ｂ
「All right. Got it.」
She can cook, and she can even do stuff like this...
Any normal guy wouldn't ever wanna let a girl like this go.
I bet she'd be really popular...
But I wonder if anyone else knows this side of her.
Rikka
「You're really big, aren't you?」
％Ｂ
「Hm?」
Rikka
「Your clothes. I remember they were big when I wore yours before too.」
％Ｂ
「I think being a guy just means you're a little bigger.」
Rikka
「I don't know the sizes of other boys. Yours was the first one I ever wore.」

％Ｂ
「I guess I should be honored?」
Rikka
「It was because I didn't have any other choice. It was musty, and it smelled like sweat, and most of all... it smelled a lot like you.」

％Ｂ
「I'm sorry.」
Rikka
「But you did it because you wanted to help me, right? And I didn't particularly hate the smell either... Okay, done.」

She ties a neat knot, and cuts the thread with portable scissors.
％Ｂ
「Done already? That was fast.」
Rikka
「It was just putting a button on. Try wearing it. I'll redo it if it doesn't go through the hole that well.」

I take my jacket from her and button it up.
％Ｂ
「Yeah, that feels good.」
Rikka
「I see. That's good.」
％Ｂ
「Thanks, Narusawa.」
Rikka
「You're welcome.」
％Ｂ
「Lunch break's almost over. We might as well go back to the classroom together... Wait, before that.」

I recall what I originally walked in for.
％Ｂ
「Have you thought about the committee thing I mentioned on Monday?」
Rikka
「I'm still thinking about it.」
％Ｂ
「...You're not just going to keep saying that, are you?」
Rikka
「Shall I give you my answer right now, then? I'm sorry, but―」
％Ｂ
「Uhh, you know what, you can keep thinking. I'll ask some other time.」
Rikka
「And I hope you're not going to just keep putting it off until I give the answer you want.」

％Ｂ
「Now I don't know about that. Haha! Oh...」
Rikka
「What's wrong?」
I realize we're having a natural conversation.
Right, Narusawa... and I...
Now that I think about it, I feel like it's always been easy talking to her, as long as I had something to start with.

I should've just talked to her casually like this, without thinking about anything.
％Ｂ
「I was just thinking about how it's fun talking to you.」
Rikka
「I don't recall saying anything particularly interesting.」
％Ｂ
「I don't mean it like that. Just talking normally like this.」
Rikka
「...You're strange.」
all
％Ｂ
「Maybe I am... Oh, there's the warning bell. Let's hurry.」
I wait for Narusawa to grab her neatly wrapped lunchbox, and the two of us leave the music room.

Once classes end, Shinozaki and I grab Okihara-senpai and Ousaka to begin our discussion.

We're going to talk about what they're going to do for the Tanabata Festival after we agreed to think about it on Monday.

all
％Ｂ
「So this summarizes your comments.」
Shinozaki and I don't really know what to do with what's been written up on the whiteboard.
Marika
「Okihara-san wants to do something to communicate the fun, beauty, grandeur, and wonder of the ocean and the creatures that live within, and Ousaka wants to do something star-related...」


％Ｂ
「I guess that makes sense, since it's the naturalist and astronomy clubs.」
all
Misa
「I have been wanting to do something ever since Marinpia Shionagi closed down. But it's very difficult to do something on my own...」


％Ｂ
「Ousaka, what kinda star-related stuff are you thinking of?」

Sora
「Something that gets people interested in stars.」
％Ｂ
「Anything's fine as long as it gets people interested in stars?」
Sora
「...*nod* That's the goal.」
Which means neither of them has anything specific in mind.
But we can definitely tell they want to try.
％Ｂ
「Um, then would you mind listening to what I have to say?」
I continue on after seeing everyone nod.
％Ｂ
「What comes to mind immediately are things like a mini aquarium or a planetarium.」
％Ｂ
「But if we'd like to do either of those, we probably wouldn't make it in time for the Tanabata Festival.」

％Ｂ
「I know we already said we would support you any way we can, but we do have limitations in terms of manpower and budget...」

Sora
「So we should give up?」
％Ｂ
「No, that's the last thing I wanna do now that you've said you'll participate.」

％Ｂ
「I'll try to think of a plan that's realizable in the time we have, so could I please have some time?」

％Ｂ
「Perhaps we could meet once again to discuss once I've thought of something?」
Misa
「I have no issue with that! I will also put some more thought into it.」
Sora
「Ditto.」
％Ｂ
「Thank you very much. I'll call on you two again once I have an idea.」

Misa
「I will be awaiting your contact.」
Sora
「*nod*」
all
Marika
「Do you have a good idea or something?」
％Ｂ
「I haven't figured it out completely yet, but I do have something.」
My idea stems from the ocean that I saw from the plane window on my flight here, and the campground that we all went to together.

％Ｂ
「But the number of people we've got is still a bottleneck...」
Marika
「With you and me, and Okihara-san and Ousaka, that makes four...」
％Ｂ
「I'm currently trying to recruit Narusawa right now too, actually.」
Marika
「Wha...? What～? ...O-Oh, really. I hope Narusawa-san joins～ I think that'd make things fun.」


％Ｂ
「Yeah. But even if she does end up joining, she might end up being assigned to something else.」

If anything, considering Narusawa's talent, she'd probably be best put to use as part of the team organizing the Shio-cademy Fest concert that gets put on every year.

Marika
「Hmm～ ...Someone who could help us～」
％Ｂ
「Well, I do have some other leads too...」
Marika
「Wha, do you really?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. It's kind of a stretch, but...」
There's that promise I made after all, so I guess I'll go ask tomorrow.
