％Ｂ
「Zzz... Zzz...」
Natsuki
「...Hehe.」
％Ｂ
「Zzz... Zzz... Nh... nnh...gh...?」
I open my eyes. I see Natsuki naked next to me.
Natsuki
「Mmm...」
She's pressing the tip of her nose against my chest.
What's she doing? Is she half asleep?
Natsuki
「Mmhehe...」
...But it's kinda cute.
Is she just cuddling?
I hug her close.
Natsuki
「Oh... Did I wake you up?」
％Ｂ
「Mm... No, I just woke up. Sleeping started feeling like a waste when I saw you being this adorable.」


Natsuki
「Geez... Why's the first thing you say when you wake up something that embarrassing?」
％Ｂ
「It's exactly 'cause it's right after I woke up. I can just blame it on being half asleep, no matter what I say.」


I squeeze Natsuki against me.
％Ｂ
「Morning, Natsuki.」
Natsuki
「Mhm, morning... dear♪」
％Ｂ
「...You don't have to say it if you're not used to it.」
Natsuki
「Oh, you could tell? Ahaha.」
She laughs a little bashfully.
That's right. Natsuki and I turned in our marriage registration form in spring this year.\n \n\r
We both took that as the opportunity to move out from our parents' houses, and now we live here in this rented house together.

Natsuki
「It's fine if I just keep doing what I've already been doing, right
, Ryousuke

?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, that's fine.」
Natsuki buries her face in my chest even more.
It feels ticklish, but also strangely nice.
And she's naked on top of that...
This, coupled with the usual morning male physiology, is making my crotch―

Natsuki
「Hmm...?」
Oh, crap... She might've realized...
％Ｂ
「Oufh!」
My crotch suddenly feels good and slightly painful.
Natsuki's gripping my penis.
Natsuki
「Looks like you woke up down here too.」
％Ｂ
「I-I'm pretty good at waking up.」
Natsuki
「Is this morning wood? Or are you just turned on?」

％Ｂ
「It's pretty much both... but I guess I'd say it's more I'm just turned on.」
Natsuki
「Even after we did it so much last night? Not enough for you?」
％Ｂ
「That was yesterday. It resets once I sleep.」

Natsuki
「How very energetic of you.」
She starts gripping and ungripping my penis.
Natsuki
「God, you're rock hard.」
％Ｂ
「It-It's 'cause you're squeezing it.」
I reach out to her butt as payback.
I start using the palm of my hand to rub her smooth, firm butt.

Natsuki
「Nnhyah!?」
％Ｂ
「You're just as sensitive as I am.」
Natsuki
「Nnnh... It-It's just my butt, I'm fine... Nnhah...」
％Ｂ
「How about here, then?」
I slide my hand into her crotch.
Natsuki
「Nnnnhhhh!?」
My finger immediately rubs against her clitoris, and Natsuki jerks her body in response.

％Ｂ
「Yeah, you react more here.」
Natsuki
「Knnhh... Noo... hah... O-Of course... nnnhh... I-I... do... Fhh... nh...!」

I slide my finger along her slit. She's already a little damp.

％Ｂ
「How long have you been this wet for?」
Natsuki
「Nnh... That's... aahn, because... aah... you're playing with me... Nnnh...! N-Noo... Hih... ahn!」

Her reactions are so cute. I continue rubbing her.
Natsuki
「Aaahhh...! Noo... Haahn... Aah... It feels... good...! Fnnnhh...!」

Natsuki's hand squeezes tighter around my penis.
Natsuki
「Nnh... Hey... 
Ryousuke... 

Let's do it.」
She looks up at me pleadingly.
She's so cute.
％Ｂ
「Even after we did it so much last night? Not enough for you?」
I parrot her exact words back to her.
Natsuki
「Geez... Don't be mean. You're this hard already too.」

She starts rubbing my erect penis up and down.
Natsuki
「It's twitching and hot... You just wanna put this in me so badly, don't you? ...Come on... Let's do it.」


％Ｂ
「You've gotten really good at this, huh?」
I kiss her as she looks me in the eyes.
d夏希_エッチシーン８
Natsuki
「Aahhhhh! Not gooood! I'm gonna be laaate!」
We frantically run down to the living room after changing.
％Ｂ
「Of course this is gonna happen if we do it twice after we wake up!」
Natsuki
「It's your fault for turning me on by touching me like that!」

％Ｂ
「You're the one who grabbed me first! And you're the one who said you wanted to do it!」

Natsuki
「Just say no! Just hold it in!」
％Ｂ
「That's impossible!」
Natsuki
「Aghh, geez! No sex for a month!」
％Ｂ
「That's impossible for you! You'll definitely break before I do!」

Natsuki
「Th-Tha-Tha-Tha, that's... not true...!」
She's not being very convincing at all.
％Ｂ
「By the way, what time is it?」
Natsuki
「Huh? Uhh... 8:30...」
％Ｂ
「Craaaaaaaaaaaaappp! I'm leaving without you!」
Natsuki
「Ahhhh! Wait, I'm leaving too!」
all
We race each other to the entranceway.
I leap onto my bike and start pedaling standing up.
And then Natsuki jauntily sails past me on her moped.

Natsuki
「See ya lateeer!」
％Ｂ
「Agh, dammit!」
Natsuki
「Watch out for caaars!」
％Ｂ
「You too!」
I watch Natsuki from behind as I pedal away.
She got her license before we got married.
She was apparently planning on buying a cheap used car at first, but she needed money after moving out from her parents' house, so she switched plans to a moped.


％Ｂ
「Maybe I should get one too...」
I've got a driver's license too, but I decided to buy a bicycle because I figured I'd need money for our wedding and stuff.

But a moped's definitely more―
％Ｂ
「Wait, I don't have the time to just sit around and thiiink!」
％Ｂ
「Good morning!」
I hurriedly punch in my time card as soon as I get to the office.
％Ｂ
「8:57! I'm safe!」
I managed to make it in time!
Azuma
「You're out.」
％Ｂ
「No way!?」
Azuma
「What's the new hire doing coming in last?」
％Ｂ
「Uh...」
Azuma
「New hires have to get here first to clean up and prepare tea. Take a look at me. I'm always here before anyone else.」

％Ｂ
「But that's because you always sleep at the firm, Teacher...」
Azuma
「You say something?」
％Ｂ
「No...」
all
Firm Staff A
「Come on, Chief. Let's leave it at that. You can't ask a newlywed to come to work first thing in the morning.」

Firm Staff B
「What do you mean?」
Firm Staff A
「He's got his work cut out for him already. I'm sure he's sleep deprived because his newlywed night life's so intense.」

Firm Staff B
「Oh, I see.」
％Ｂ
「Please don't just accept that explanation...」
I won't deny that my nights are intense, but this time it's more because my morning got too wild...

Azuma
「It's not like I don't understand where you're coming from, but try not to get too crazy with the newlywed life. It's already been two years since you started working here. I can't have you acting like a student forever.」


Azuma
「And you two, don't go too easy on the new guy. You won't be able to set an example as his seniors that way.」

Firm Staff A
「Yes...」
Firm Staff B
「Please excuse us.」
％Ｂ
「I'm very sorry... I'll take care not to let this happen again.」
all
I bow my head in apology to Azuma-san.
I do the same to my senior coworkers before going to my desk.
％Ｂ
「Sigh...」
I even got my senior coworkers in trouble...
Doing it twice in the morning definitely wasn't a good idea.
We got too carried away.
I can't offer any counterargument to being told I'm acting like a student when I'm doing stuff like that.
I need to pull myself together more.
I've finally gotten the opportunity to learn at the feet of the person I admire...
％Ｂ
「Oh, I'll get it!」
％Ｂ
「Yes, this is the Azuma Architectural Firm. Oh, Satou-sama. Thank you very much for all of your help with everything. Yes... About the matter from the previous day? Let's see, well, Azuma-san is―」


I glance over at Azuma-san. He's making a violent "Tell them I'm not here!" gesture at me.

all
％Ｂ
「...He's currently out of the office... Yes... We will contact you again at a later point... Yes, I'm very sorry. Please excuse me, then.」


Azuma
「Hm, good job. You've gotten used to working here. Just what I'd expect from the man I personally saw potential in.」


Firm Staff B
「Chief, your words don't match what you were saying earlier.」
Azuma
「Hm? That so?」
Firm Staff A
「More importantly, we still aren't finished with Satou-san's case?」
Azuma
「What do you mean, finished? I haven't even started it yet. I just haven't felt like it, you know?」

Firm Staff B
「Please pull yourself together. You won't be able to set a good example for the new hire if you're like that.」

Azuma
「Hm... My bad.」
％Ｂ
「Haha...」
all
％Ｂ
「Oh, I'll get it!」
％Ｂ
「Yes, this is the Azuma Architectural Firm.」
I was accepted into the architecture department at a local university after graduating from Shionagi First Academy.
I started a formal internship with Azuma-san's firm that I kept up all throughout university.

That got Azuma-san to acknowledge my passion, and after university I was finally able to become formally hired by the Azuma Morio Architectural Firm, which had always been a dream of mine.


I've been a working adult for two years now.
I'm still in the middle of learning how to do work as a new hire.
As for what Natsuki's doing, she moved on to study at a vocational school for photography to learn things on a more serious level after graduating high school.

Vocational schools are two-year programs, so by the time I was out of university, she had already been doing actual work for two years.

She's currently working as an assistant for a female photographer at a studio in town, learning professional photography techniques.

％Ｂ
「Yes. Yes, I understand. Please excuse me, then.」

％Ｂ
「Phew. Now then, where should we start?」
Firm Staff A
「We need to at least get started on Satou-san's work. Could you get some documents prepared for me?」

％Ｂ
「Oh, yes!」
Firm Staff B
「And could I ask you to make a copy of this blueprint once you're done with that?」

％Ｂ
「Of course!」
Azuma
「I'll need you to make me some coffee, then.」
％Ｂ
「Yes, I would love to!」
Firm Staff A & B
「Chief...」
all
My role at the firm is mostly to man the phone, help my senior coworkers with blueprints, and attend to Azuma-san's needs.

In a nutshell, it's still mostly grunt work.
It may not be anything impressive, but it's definitely a good learning experience to come into direct contact with Azuma-san's work, as well as my senior coworkers'.

I'm definitely making progress toward my dream of becoming an architect.
And Natsuki's also...
％Ｂ
「...」
No one moves to go home when the clock sounds to indicate it's time to leave.

I've come to know something since I've started working here.
And that's the fact that Azuma-san becomes incredibly focused while he works.
He might seem kind of irresponsible normally, but the level of concentration he displays once he actually gets working is amazing.

The noise in his surroundings means nothing to him once he starts focusing on his work.

And my senior coworkers are the same way.
They've definitely earned Azuma-san's approval. They're good enough at their jobs that it wouldn't be strange for them to become independent architects at any moment.

I'm completely in awe, not just of Azuma-san, but also of my coworkers.
Enough to feel embarrassed of how I recklessly tried to work here as soon as I came back to Shionagi.

But I can't be too intimidated by them.
I need to hurry up and become fully fledged, and become acknowledged by Azuma-san in the same way as my senior coworkers...!

Azuma
「Phew... Hey
, Hino

.」
％Ｂ
「Y-Yes! Is there work for me to do!? What should I do!?」
Azuma
「You can go home for the day.」
％Ｂ
「Wha...?」
Azuma
「Give me one last cup of coffee. You can go home after that.」

％Ｂ
「Uh huh... Wait, but what about everyone else...?」
Azuma
「We'll probably be here until late tonight.」
Firm Staff A
「Honestly, another all-nighter?」
Firm Staff B
「What should we do about dinner? Should I go buy something?」

％Ｂ
「Oh, then I'll go buy it for you!」
Azuma
「It's fine. You just go home.」
％Ｂ
「But if you're all staying behind, then I'll―」
Azuma
「I'm saying there's no need for you to stay.」
％Ｂ
「Oh...」
all
There's... no need.
I guess he's saying that he still can't entrust someone inexperienced like me with any work...

％Ｂ
「I apologize... I shouldn't have said that. I'll go make that coffee for you.」

Azuma
「Yeah. That'd be great.」
all
I head to the kitchen to make the coffee.
Firm Staff A
「...I don't know if you should've phrased it that way, Chief. He looks down.」

Firm Staff B
「I also think what you said just now could be taken the wrong way. Someone should go speak with him.」

Azuma
「Y-You think so? I didn't mean it that way, though. Okay then, you two go.」


Firm Staff B
「I refuse. You should speak with him yourself, Chief.」

Firm Staff A
「I think so too. Or else, our new hire you're expecting so much out of might quit.」

Azuma
「I-I didn't hire him because I was expecting anything out of him or anything. I just had to do it because he was being so stubborn―」

Firm Staff A
「Our firm's already short-staffed as it is. Would you really hire someone inexperienced if you weren't expecting things out of him?」

Firm Staff B
「I hear they call people like you a tsundere, you know.」
Azuma
「Ts-Tsundere? Me?」
Firm Staff A
「You've long since acknowledged the fact that he's at least motivated enough, haven't you?」
Firm Staff B
「Regardless, I believe you should go speak with him.」
Azuma
「Mmmh...」
all
...I made enough coffee for all three of them.
％Ｂ
「Thank you all for waiting. Here's your coffee.」

Azuma
「Ahem... Uhh... Can I talk with you a bit?」
％Ｂ
「Oh, yes. What is it?」
Azuma
「Just so you know... When I said there was no need for you to stay, I meant it as in you don't need to try to take up more work than necessary right now.」

％Ｂ
「Wha...?」
Azuma
「You've still got a lot to learn, so you should just be thorough about the things you have in front of you right now, one by one.」

Azuma
「You'll be buried in work eventually anyway. No one's gonna care if you say you want to go home early at that point.」


all
Firm Staff A
「So what he's saying is that the newlywed should just go home to his wife and show her a good time.」

％Ｂ
「Senpai...」
Firm Staff B
「But you shouldn't get too caught up with nighttime activities. You wouldn't want it to affect your work the next day.」

％Ｂ
「No, uh...」
I really wish she wouldn't just casually make an innuendo with a straight face like that...
Azuma
「Either way, you can go home for today. I'll be counting on you again tomorrow.」

Firm Staff A
「Good work today.」
Firm Staff B
「Great work. See you tomorrow.」
％Ｂ
「Y-Yes! I'll be leaving, then!」
all
％Ｂ
「I'm hooome.」
Natsuki's not home yet.
I place the ads and flyers from the mailbox on the table.

％Ｂ
「Looks like I'm in charge of cooking again today.」
The two of us agreed on a few rules once we started living together.
One of them is that "whoever comes home first makes dinner."
I currently make dinner about 70 percent of the time right now.
I've always made my own food, so I'm not bad at cooking or anything, and it's kind of fun in its own way.

Though I guess, like Azuma-san said, I might not be able to do stuff like this once I start getting more work to do.


％Ｂ
「All right, what's dinner gonna be tonight...?」
I stare into the fridge and think about what to make.
％Ｂ
「We've got tofu, ground meat, and green onion... I'm pretty sure we've still got garlic and ginger too...」

So dinner tonight is mapo tofu!
I hear a moped being parked outside as I'm cutting up the ginger.
Looks like Natsuki's home.
Natsuki
「I'm hooome!」
％Ｂ
「Hey, welcome hooome.」
Natsuki walks in, puts her stuff down, and immediately walks over to me.

Natsuki
「I'm home
, Ryousuke

. Mmm... chu♪」
Our welcome-home kiss. This is more of an unspoken agreement between us than a rule.\n 

It's as natural as breathing for us.
％Ｂ
「Mm... Welcome home.」
Natsuki
「What are you making?」
％Ｂ
「Mapo tofu.」
Natsuki
「I'll help, then.」
％Ｂ
「Nah, I only need to sauté it for a bit, so you can take it easy.」
Natsuki
「You sure? Okay then, I'll let you handle it.」
all
Natsuki
「Finished! That was delicious!」
％Ｂ
「Thanks.」
Natsuki
「I'll do the cleanup tonight, then.」
Another one of our rules is that whoever comes home second is in charge of doing the dishes.\n\r

So it basically means that one of us cooks, and the other does the dishes.
Though it's not really that absolute of a rule, since we end up doing the dishes together a lot of the time.


％Ｂ
「Oh yeah, actually, there's mail for you. Though it's all ads...」

I hand her the sheaf of ads addressed to Natsuki.

all
She goes through them one by one.
Natsuki
「
Hino Natsuki-sama, huh... 
Hmm... 
I'm still not really used to this name.」
％Ｂ
「Really? I'm used to it.」
Natsuki
「Well obviously. You've always had that name. I still write Segawa on reflex when I write my name.」


Natsuki
「In fact, I don't even realize when people are calling my name. It actually makes me look around 'cause I keep thinking you're around.」


％Ｂ
「You'll get used to it eventually. It's only been two months since we got married, after all.」
Natsuki
「Two months... Two months already, huh...」
She says it quietly.
Our marriage─
Was timed a little differently from how we had expected.
We were planning on getting married eventually.
But a little later on... Once things had calmed down for both of us after we had gotten a little further along in our careers.

But that plan ended up being thrown out the window about three months ago...
It was about halfway through March, back when the chill of winter was finally beginning to loosen.
Natsuki said we should go out on a date to the mall that day.

I was trying to get a stuffed animal she wanted out of a claw machine game when she casually said─

Natsuki
「By the way.」
％Ｂ
「Hmm... What's up...?」
Natsuki
「It... hasn't come this month.」
％Ｂ
「...What hasn't?」
Natsuki
「...My period.」
％Ｂ
「Hm... Hm?」
Natsuki
「It's never come late before for me...」
％Ｂ
「...You don't mean...」
Natsuki
「...Maybe it happened... Or what if I said something like that, or something...? Ahaha...」
I let go of the button on the machine without thinking. The claw pointlessly descended and ascended nowhere close to the stuffed animal I was trying to get.

Natsuki
「Oh, b-but I don't know for sure yet, okay? It might just be late 'cause I've been busy with work with it being graduation season and all...」


％Ｂ
「...」
I silently took her by the hand and more or less started dragging her away.

Natsuki
「Uh... Huh? Where are we going? The drugstore?」
％Ｂ
「We'll go there later.」
Natsuki
「Th-Then the hospital? A gynecologist?」
％Ｂ
「Your house.」
Natsuki
「Wha... My house? What are we gonna do at my house?」

％Ｂ
「Isn't it obvious? I'm gonna greet your parents.」

Natsuki
「G-Greet... You're not going to...!?」
all
We got to her house, and I sat down with Natsuki in front of her parents.

I had already met Natsuki's parents a few times back when we were students, so they knew me.

I took a deep breath and straightened my back.
％Ｂ
「I have come here today to make a request of the two of you.」
I saw Natsuki's parents tense up. They must've realized something from my tone of voice.

％Ｂ
「I would like for you to allow Natsuki... no, Natsuki-san and I to get ma―」
Natsuki
「Ahhhhhhhhh!」
％Ｂ
「Wh-What's wrong?」
But then Natsuki suddenly yelled, stood up, and walked out, leaving her parents and me dumbfounded in her wake.

She came back a little later and whispered into my ear.
Natsuki
「U-Um, so actually... Well... It's here...」
％Ｂ
「"It's here," with that timing... You had to be kidding me.」
Natsuki
「Man, I was just as surprised as you were. It really hadn't ever been late before.」

Natsuki
「But what really surprised me was when you still told my parents that you wanted them to let us get married.」

％Ｂ
「Huh? Why?」
Natsuki
「Well, because you were going to marry me to take responsibility because you thought we made a baby, right?」

Natsuki
「But we didn't make one, so couldn't we have just pretended it was about something else instead?」

％Ｂ
「Thinking we might've made a baby might've been the trigger. But I still wanted to be with you forever, and I figured I'd just end up saying the same thing a year from now as I would've back then.」


Natsuki
「Oh...」
％Ｂ
「But yeah, I think I might've rushed into things. You might've wanted to stay independent for a little longer... or maybe I ended up getting in the way of your job... Stuff like that.」


Natsuki
「No, that's not true! It made me really happy! You were really cool back then

, Ryousuke

. I think it was the most wonderful I've ever seen you until now... Mhm.」

Her cheeks go a little pink.
Natsuki
「But you know, we never would've gotten the okay if my parents were old fashioned. It's a good thing they're pretty casual.」


％Ｂ
「Yeah, that's true. I'm still a complete beginner who's only just started working, after all. I'm seriously surprised they allowed it.」


Natsuki
「It's 'cause my parents trust me. Maybe they just thought that there wouldn't be anything wrong with someone I picked?」


％Ｂ
「I'm seriously so grateful to your parents. They gave me a very precious treasure.」

Natsuki
「Oh, I think I might like the sound of that... Ehehe.」
Natsuki
「Hey
, Ryousuke

. Do you want a baby?」
％Ｂ
「Of course I do. But I wanna enjoy our newlywed life together for now.」


Natsuki
「Me too! I'm having so much fun every day right now! But if you want a baby, then let me know right away, okay? I'll do my best and pump out one after another!」


％Ｂ
「Guess I'll have to pump out tons of work for the money when that happens.」
One day, we'll move on from a life with just the two of us, to a family with children.
I'm looking forward to it.\n\r
I'll need to do good work and make lots of money for when that happens.
