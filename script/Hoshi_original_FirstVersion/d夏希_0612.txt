Lunch break.
I'm eating lunch with Segawa.
Segawa's already done eating. She's pulled her digital camera out from its bag and she's currently looking through the photos on the memory card.

％Ｂ
「Oh yeah, there's something I needed to tell you.」
Natsuki
「Mm... If you're going to confess your love to me, then make it somewhere more romantic.」
％Ｂ
「Got it. I'll do it on a day with a nice sunset.」
Natsuki
「Roger that.」
all
％Ｂ
「...」
Natsuki
「So what is it?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, it's about the event committee. We're meeting in the committee office after school. We're going to have a meeting with the naturalist club.」

Natsuki
「Roger that.」
all
We never look at each other the whole time.
I've somehow gotten used to spending time with Segawa this way.
Second-Year Girl A
「Excuse me... Segawa-san.」
％Ｂ
「Hm...?」
A girl comes up to talk to Segawa.
She keeps glancing at me, looking a little embarrassed.
Second-Year Girl A
「Did you... bring the thing?」
Natsuki
「Of course. I've got it right here.」
She pulls an envelope out from her camera bag.
Natsuki
「I got some great shots.」
Second-Year Girl A
「Th-Thank you!」
She accepts the envelope and happily clutches it to her chest.
Second-Year Girl A
「Um... How should I repay you?」
Natsuki
「I don't need any repayment. Let me know if you need anything again.」
Second-Year Girl A
「O-Okay... Thank you so much! I'll treasure them. Then... See you.」

The girl runs out of the classroom.
％Ｂ
「...What was that about?」
Natsuki
「Mmm... She asked me to take some photos for her.」
％Ｂ
「Photos... of what?」
Natsuki
「There's apparently an upperclassman boy she likes who's in the basketball club. She wanted me to take a few photos of him for her.」

％Ｂ
「Huh... But why doesn't she just ask the guy himself for some pictures?」

Natsuki
「You're so dumb. How could she when it's a one-sided thing?」
％Ｂ
「I guess that's true... Wait, but isn't that kinda like spying?」

Natsuki
「I made sure to get permission from the person in question.」
％Ｂ
「What? ...Permission? ...How?」
Natsuki
「Like, "There's a girl who wants to have photos of you, so can I give her some?" Most guys are happy to let me take photos after that.」


％Ｂ
「Yeah, I doubt any guy would say no after hearing that...」
Natsuki
「I also accept digital requests for saving on your phone and stuff.」
％Ｂ
「You've got all bases covered, huh...」
Natsuki
「Can I give photos of you to any girls who want them too?」
％Ｂ
「Come on now. You'll never have enough photos if you start doing that.」

Natsuki
「I'll specifically pick out the ones where your eyes are half closed or you're making a dumb face.」
％Ｂ
「I am so very sorry I got ahead of myself I am sorry.」
％Ｂ
「...By the way... Have there been any girls who've wanted a photo of me since I transferred in?」

Natsuki
「Nope. Zero.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, well, figures...」
Natsuki
「But I do get a lot more of these kinds of requests than you'd expect. I can't believe there's this much unrequited love going around.」

％Ｂ
「Would you wanna have pictures of the guy you like too?」
Natsuki
「Ahahah, I wouldn't do anything that roundabout. I'd just go tell them myself.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah... That does sound like you.」
all
Which means... that Segawa currently doesn't have anyone she likes.
...Hm?
...Did I feel relieved just now...?
After school.
We're discussing the naturalist club's Tanabata Festival display with Okihara-senpai.


Marika
「I think we should be okay for the content of the display itself, but the issue would be the location.」

Misa
「Is the second chemistry classroom too cramped after all?」
Marika
「It wouldn't be impossible, but we would have quite a few tanks, and I think we would have many people visit too. I don't know if it would be good to have everyone smushed in...」


Misa
「Very true... I would like visitors to be able to relax and take their time viewing, if possible.」

all
％Ｂ
「The first chemistry classroom isn't free?」
Marika
「I looked it up, but the science club's apparently using it for their "Amazing Science Show."」

％Ｂ
「So I guess we'll have to find another classroom, then.」
Marika
「But the thing is, all of the usable-looking classrooms have been claimed already...」
％Ｂ
「I see... I guess we're seeing the consequences of our late start now...」

Misa
「I apologize. This may not have happened if I had decided to participate from the very beginning.」

％Ｂ
「Oh, no, I didn't mean it like...」
all
Natsuki
「Hey, how about we use the old school building?」
Misa
「The old school building...」
all
Marika
「Umm, it doesn't seem like any part of the old school building's been requested yet.」
％Ｂ
「That place is off limits, isn't it?」
all
Natsuki
「But maybe they'd open it up just for the day of the festival? We might not be able to use the whole building, but I feel we might be able to negotiate using just one classroom.」


％Ｂ
「Yeah... That's true...」
all
But I wonder if Yukimura's gonna get mad at me if we end up using the old school building...
We'd be in there all the time until the end of the festival. It definitely wouldn't be as calm and quiet as before...

％Ｂ
「I'll try asking Shuuichi about it later.」
Natsuki
「Speaking of which, where'd Nirasawa go? I don't see him anywhere.」
Marika
「He went to the astronomy club's clubroom to have a meeting with Ousaka-san.」
Natsuki
「Then how about we go borrow the key from the faculty office and actually go to the old school building right now?」

％Ｂ
「Wha... Right now?」
Natsuki
「Just to inspect the place. We'll need to see if it's usable for the marine zoo.」

Marika
「I wonder if they'll let us borrow the key, though...」
Natsuki
「I'm sure it'll be fine if we just say we've gotten permission from Nirasawa to ask. We can just make it his fault if things go wrong.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, that's true. All right then, let's go inspect the building.」
Marika
「I-Is that really okay...?」
all
We go borrow the key from the faculty office and enter the old school building.
％Ｂ
「I didn't think we'd actually be able to use Shuuichi's name to get the key...」
Marika
「Nirasawa-kun's actually really well regarded by the teachers, you know.」

Natsuki
「Since he looks like a diligent, talented student at first glance.」
Marika
「I-I'm sure it's because he really is diligent, and because he's been working hard in the event committee ever since last year.」

We walk through several of the classrooms.
Natsuki
「Oh, this room seems pretty big.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, it is. We could probably do any layout we wanted since there aren't many desks.」
all
This room was definitely used as a classroom in the past.
The few remaining desks are surprisingly sturdy, and they don't budge at all when we push.
Marika
「What do you think, Okihara-san?」
Misa
「I believe this would work. It is quite large, and the desks appear sturdy enough to support water tanks.」

％Ｂ
「Let's make this room our first choice, then.」
Misa
「Yes, let's do so.」
Touko
「Oh...」
％Ｂ
「Hm... Uh, Yukimura...!?」
We run into Yukimura as we're leaving the chemistry classroom.
Natsuki
「Wha, Touko?」
Marika
「Oh, Yukimura-san. What are you doing here?」
Touko
「Uhh... Um... Ahaha...」
％Ｂ
「...You came over here again?」
I ask Yukimura in a low voice.
Touko
「...M-Mhm... Yeah.」
％Ｂ
「...What are you gonna do?」
Touko
「...What do you mean... Cover for me.」
％Ｂ
「...Why me?」
Natsuki
「What are you two whispering about?」
％Ｂ
「Uhh, well... I was just asking Yukimura what she was doing here. And then she started telling me about how she followed us here 'cause she wanted to help out with the event committee too.」


Touko
「Wha!?」
％Ｂ
「You know, 'cause Yukimura gets pretty shy about stuff like this, so it was apparently kinda hard for her to say it herself.」

Touko
「Wha... Wait a second. I never said―」
Marika
「Oh, then you should've just said so without being shy about it. We always need more people helping, so we'd love to have you, Yukimura-san.」


Touko
「Oh, well... Mhm... Um... But, Flower-chan?」
Misa
「This reminds me of when we went camping. I would be very happy if you would join our numbers once more.」

Touko
「Uhh... W-Well, yeah, that was fun, but...」
Shuuichi
「Oh, there you are. I figured it was you guys when I heard voices.」

all
Natsuki
「Oh, Nirasawa and Sora. What are you doing here?」
Sora
「...Inspecting.」
Shuuichi
「We were looking for a room for the astronomy club's display, but we couldn't find any good rooms. So we thought we could use the old school building's audiovisual room, so we came to take a look.」

％Ｂ
「Oh, so you're here for the same reason we are. The naturalist club's going to use the chemistry room in this building.」

Shuuichi
「Also, don't use my name without asking. I had to explain myself when we went to the faculty office to borrow the key.」

all
Marika
「Hey, Nirasawa-kun. Yukimura-san says she wants to help out the event committee with us. It's okay, right?」

Touko
「U-Um, Flower-chan? Maybe we could talk about that later...」
Shuuichi
「Yukimura? Oh, Yukimura Touko from class E. I don't mind. We always need more people.」

Marika
「Isn't that great, Yukimura-san?」
all
Touko
「Wha... M-Mhm... Huh?」
I move toward Yukimura and whisper to her.
％Ｂ
「...Uhh, so that was good enough, right...? This building's gonna get a bit less quiet for a while...」

Touko
「...Just whose fault do you think this is?」
％Ｂ
「...Sorry. I couldn't think of anything better.」
％Ｂ
「But it'll be easier to decline invitations to join clubs too if you're with us, you know.」

Touko
「...Sigh... Fine. Fine, I'll do it. And it's true that going camping was fun anyway, so doing something with this group doesn't seem too bad.」


all
Shuuichi
「What are you guys going to do? Head back?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, we've decided on which classroom we're gonna use, so I don't think we need to be here anymore today.」

all
Misa
「Would you all like to come with me to the second chemistry classroom now?」
％Ｂ
「Is there something there?」
Misa
「I have actually already brought a few organisms I would like to display for the Tanabata Festival from home. Would you be interested in seeing them?」

Marika
「Oh, I would love to～」
Natsuki
「It sounds fun, so I'll come too.」
all
Touko
「I think I'll go look too, since I don't have anything better to do.」
％Ｂ
「I'll come too. I'd like to know what kind of things you're going to display.」

Sora
「...I want to see.」
all
Shuuichi
「Then I'll come too―」
Natsuki
「Okay Nirasawa, you're returning the key, then.」
Shuuichi
「Wha... I'm returning it?」
Natsuki
「Obviously. We borrowed it in your name.」

all
％Ｂ
「Here you go, here's the key. We'll be going to the second chemistry classroom now.」
Marika
「You should come once you're done. See you there.」
Shuuichi
「S-Sure...」
We arrive at the second chemistry classroom.
There are a few new water tanks in addition to the jellyfish, just like Okihara-senpai said.

Marika
「Huh? Huh? Is this a sea slug?」
Misa
「Yes. It would be a Dirona pellucida.」
Touko
「What's this one?」
Misa
「That would also be a sea slug. Diaulula boreopacifica.」
all
Natsuki
「I know this one. It's called a sea hare, right?」
Misa
「It is. I am very impressed you know of it.」
all
Sora
「...There's a star.」

Misa
「It is a blue bat sea star. Sea stars, as you may expect, are indeed named for their resemblance to stars.」


Sora
「...Star...」
all
％Ｂ
「Wow. It's already like a mini aquarium in here.」

Misa
「There is still yet more to come. I am planning on gradually bringing more from home before the Tanabata Festival.」

％Ｂ
「You've been keeping all of these at your house?」
Misa
「Yes. They were originally being kept by the naturalist club. I believe I told you before that I had let go of the ones I could not maintain on my own, yes?」


Misa
「I had most of them taken in by acquaintances in the aquarium industry, but I took several of them home with me, and have been taking care of them ever since.」


％Ｂ
「I see.」
Natsuki
「Hey, Misa-san, is this a sea urchin?」
Misa
「It is an eastern Heliocidaris sea urchin. All of these here are native to Shionagi's sea.」

Natsuki
「Can you eat this?」
Misa
「Yes, of course.」
all
Sora
「...Gulp.」
Don't swallow like that...
all
％Ｂ
「Are you planning on only displaying the ones you've been keeping at home?」
Misa
「I would also like to go and collect as many as I am able.」

％Ｂ
「That means you'll actually be going to the ocean to catch them, right? I'll help you too.」

Misa
「Yes. I will begin preparing soon, so I will be counting on you when the time comes!」
