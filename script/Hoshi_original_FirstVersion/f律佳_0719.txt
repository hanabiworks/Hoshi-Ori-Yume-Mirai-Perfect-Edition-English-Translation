Marika
「Wooow～～ It's so pretty～～」
Misa
「The stars seem so much closer, even though we are only a little bit higher up.」
We're all watching the stars on the rooftop for our first day of summer break.
We already got permission to be up here for the night yesterday, so there's nothing to worry about.

all
Sora
「Vega in Lyra, Altair in Aquila, Deneb in Cygnus. Joining these three stars together forms the summer triangle.」

She draws out a big triangle across the Milky Way with her finger.

Touko
「That's Orihime and Hikoboshi, right?」
Sora
「...*nod* And Deneb is the magpie bridge.」
Natsuki
「What's the magpie bridge?」
all
Sora
「In ancient Chinese myth, magpies line up their wings to form a bridge over the Milky Way when Orihime and Hikoboshi meet.」

Her explanations are easy to understand and full of fun trivia.
all
Rikka
「Being at school at night feels a bit strange.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, it does...」
The two of us are lying down next to each other.
A wide expanse of stars fills our vision.
With Ousaka's narration, it's like we're in a planetarium.
Rikka
「I... used to think it was okay for Orihime and Hikoboshi to always meet, just once a year.」

％Ｂ
「I remember you saying that when we went camping, yeah.」
Rikka
「Mhm... But now... We see each other every day, smile, hear each other's voice, hold hands, talk about how we love each other... I think I'm really blessed for that.」


％Ｂ
「Me too. I wanna see you every day. And when I can't I wanna talk to you no matter what, whether it's over the phone or messaging.」

Rikka
「Hehe. I wonder if Orihime and Hikoboshi would be less lonely if they had smartphones.」

％Ｂ
「I dunno. I know I'd definitely wanna see you in person, at least.」
％Ｂ
「And we can't do stuff like this through smartphones.」
I hold her hand.
I feel a gentle warmth there, in the comfortable wind blowing down from the mountains.

Rikka
「That's true. And if I'm going to say I love you, I want to say it with your face close to me.」
I turn my head to the side, only to find her already looking back at me.
We smile at each other ticklishly.
Rikka
「Ehehe. Every single day has been wonderful for me after meeting you.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. I love you, Rikka.」
Rikka
「I love you soooo much. Hehehe.」
My entire body goes comfortably numb at her startlingly tender voice.
I think it's important to put your feelings into words.
Because it can make you this happy.
Marika
「Hawaaah...」
all
％Ｂ
「...?」

Touko
「...It's embarrassing just watching you guys, just so you know.」
Natsuki
「It'd be nice if you two would remember that we're here too... You're so sugary sweet, I can't even bear to point the camera at you.」


all
Sora
「Boys over stars...」
％Ｂ
「Uh... We were listening to you, Ousaka.」

Touko
「While you were flirting, yeah.」
Rikka
「Uuuh... I'm sorry. That was rude of us.」
all
Misa
「I am sure everyone who comes to visit for the Tanabata Festival would be overjoyed if we could recreate this starry sky.」

Okihara-senpai speaks quietly, looking up at the night sky.
Misa
「It would make me very happy if we could teach them about Shionagi's nature... and about the ocean too.」

％Ｂ
「That would be nice.」
Misa
「Thank you so very much.」
％Ｂ
「Huh?」
Misa
「I think that if it had not been for you, I would still be taking care of the jellyfish by myself.」

Misa
「Last year, I simply watched the Tanabata Festival from afar. I am... very glad that the event organization committee has helped me and allowed for me to participate in the Tanabata Festival.」

％Ｂ
「Okihara-senpai...」
all
Sora
「I've always watched the stars alone too. You connected all of us, Ryou. You're the sun...」

Sora
「I've always watched the stars alone too. You connected all of us. You're the sun...」

％Ｂ
「The sun?」
Sora
「...*nod* We're always orbiting you.」
％Ｂ
「Haha, I didn't do anything that impressive.」
all
Natsuki
「It's fine, isn't it? That's what Sora thinks, so you should just be happy about it.」

Misa
「If we are the solar system... then that would mean that we are all a single unit.」

Natsuki
「I like it, I like it! It's like we're really a team now! Oh, I know! Let's decide on a team name, then!」

all
％Ｂ
「A team name?」
Natsuki
「How about the Shionagi Friends!?」
％Ｂ
「That's a bit normal, isn't it?」
Misa
「Nature is an ever-present friend. I am in total agreement.」
Natsuki
「You really get it, Misa-san!」
％Ｂ
「What!? That had that deep of a meaning!?」
Marika
「Mhm, mhm. I think it's great.」
Rikka
「The Shionagi Friends... It has a nice ring to it.」
Touko
「Mmm... It's a bit embarrassing. But I think it's a good name.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
all
Natsuki
「Any objections?」
％Ｂ
「...I do not have any. It has begun to sound like a very profound, wonderful team name.」

all
Well, anyway...
Now that we have a name, everything suddenly seems a lot more legitimate.
％Ｂ
「All right everyone! Let's make sure the Tanabata Festival's a success!」
Sora & Marika & Natsuki & Misa & Rikka & Touko
「Right!」
Their cheery response cuts through the night.
Bright, cheery premonitions dance in my heart. I'll be able to pull this off if it's with them.
