The city science museum's got a good number of visitors since it's currently spring break for schools.

Today's the day the new planetarium show, "Tale of the Moon," begins airing.

The show that Sora proposed.
Sora came up with most of the show's structure as well.
I'm happy to know that my ideas have also been incorporated.
I'm incredibly satisfied to know that I was of use to her.
I've come to watch, since it's the first day.
Without telling Sora.
I buy a ticket and sit in my assigned seat.
I'm happy to see that the audience is pretty full.
I can see groups of parents with their kids coming here during their spring break.
％Ｂ
「Oh...」
Looks like it's starting...
Sora appears in her designated spot as the planetarium navigator.
She looks a little nervous for her first show.
Sora
「...Phew...」
％Ｂ
「...」
Sora
「...!」
I meet gazes with Sora.
Her eyes go wide for a moment when she sees me.
％Ｂ
「...Mhm.」
I give her a small nod.
Sora
「...Mm...」
She gives a little smile and nods back.
It looks like she's calmed down a little.
The lights go out, and the audience goes quiet.
I can hear oohs and ahhs from the kids as the stars glimmer into visibility up on the ceiling.

Sora
「...What do you think the closest thing in space is for those of you who live on Earth...?」

Sora's narration begins.
Sora
「...The sun which shines down onto the Earth? Our neighbors, Venus or Mars? No... The answer is the moon.」

Sora
「...The moon is the closest and most familiar celestial body to those who live on Earth. The moon has watched over us for a very long time, since the times of our most distant ancestors.」


Sora
「Humans feel instinctual fear when the sun sets and night falls. But the moon shines gently down on us when we are frightened of the darkness.」

Sora
「As if it were saying to us, "It's okay. I'm watching over you"... We treat the moon with respect when we speak of it.」


Sora
「Today, we have invited guests from that very moon. Let's listen to their many stories.」

Grade-School Boy A
「That was so cool!」
Grade-School Girl A
「I wanna go to the moon too. I wanna meet the moon goddess!」
Grade-School Boy B
「I want to be an astronaut when I grow up!」
Grade-School Boy A
「Me too! And I'm gonna go to the moon, and get on TV!」
％Ｂ
「...」
The kids excitedly leave the showing area after watching the show.

Their reactions are proof that the show was a success.
To communicate the wonder of the stars to lots of people.
Sora's doing more and more to further her dream, and to do the things she wants to do.
％Ｂ
「All right. I need to do my best too.」
I need to get back to the firm and get working on Shuuichi's home sweet home.
％Ｂ
「Hm... Mmmm... It's gotten pretty late...」
I look at the clock. It's past seven o'clock.
I guess that means I've been drafting out a design for over five hours straight, then...
I stretch my tensed-up neck and shoulders and push my hands against my back.
Sora's probably about to be done with her work, so maybe I'll go pick her up for a change.\n\r

I wanna congratulate her on the show being a success too.
And most importantly, I want to tell her about how the kids really loved it.
I walk through the marketplace, toward the science museum.
There are a lot of office workers on their way home from work, and students heading back from club activities.
％Ｂ
「...Hm?」
There's a familiar-looking girl running toward me─
Sora
「...Ryou!」
all
％Ｂ
「Oh, Sora? Good job toda―agh!」
Sora runs over and suddenly hugs me.
Sora
「Ryou, Ryou, Ryou!」
Sora
「Hahh, hahh, I'm done with work!」
％Ｂ
「O-Oh, so you're done already? I was planning on picking you up.」

Sora
「I'm done. I did my best so I could be done early. Because I wanted to see you as soon as possible.」
She squeezes me tight.
％Ｂ
「H-Hey... People are watching, you know.」
Sora
「...Thanks for coming.」
％Ｂ
「Y-Yeah, it was your first time writing a show like that, so I wanted to be there for the first showing to celebrate.」

Sora
「...I was nervous for my first time. But I calmed down when I saw you sitting in the audience.」

Sora
「...I was nervous for my first time. But I calmed down when I saw you sitting in the audience.」

Sora
「It's thanks to you, Ryou.」
Sora
「It's thanks to you.」
％Ｂ
「I didn't do anything. I just came to watch.」
Sora
「...*shake shake* You were there for me. That's more than enough to reassure me.」

Sora
「...*shake shake* You were there for me. That's more than enough to reassure me.」

％Ｂ
「Hearing that makes me happy too.」
Sora
「*nod*」
She nods happily and wraps her arms around me tighter.
People keep glancing at us as they walk by.
I can hear a few quiet voices saying things like, "I'm so jealous～"
Sora
「...─Gasp!」
It looks like Sora's finally realized we're still in public.
She pulls away with a red face.
Sora
「...I lost control a little.」
Sora
「...Ahem... How was the show?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah... It was great. The kids especially liked it. I heard them talking about how they wanted to be astronauts or go see the moon goddess and stuff.」


Sora
「...Really?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. I wish you could've seen them for yourself.」
Sora
「...That makes me happy. The children's reactions are what I think about the most.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, kids always say exactly what's on their minds. So that means the show was a success, then.」

％Ｂ
「Congratulations, Sora.」
Sora
「...Thank you. I feel a little more confident now.」
％Ｂ
「Good luck for the rest of the showings too.」
Sora
「...*nod* I'll do my best.」
％Ｂ
「Now then. Let's celebrate your show airing, and get something good to eat.」

Sora
「You don't have work?」
％Ｂ
「Celebrating's more important today.」
Sora hesitates a little, but then gives a small nod and smiles.
Sora
「...I'll let you spoil me today.」
She hooks her arm around mine.
