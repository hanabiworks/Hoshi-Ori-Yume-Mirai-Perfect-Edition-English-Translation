I'm finally down to my last exam.
I won't know how I did until next week, but I'm incredibly confident.

Rikka already had good grades, and she doesn't seem to be worried this time around either, so I might be able to start thinking about the specifics for our date about now.

I've been putting together plans for our date while I've been studying. I've got something specific in mind already.
％Ｂ
「Rikka. What do you think about going to the beach for our date tomorrow?」
From what I've looked up, Shionagi's beach is apparently going to be open to the public starting tomorrow.

The weather's suddenly gotten hot lately, so I think the beach sounds like the perfect opportunity to cool off.

And there's also a small... no, a pretty big ulterior motive in that I wanna see Rikka in a swimsuit.
Rikka
「The beach...」
She doesn't look too enthusiastic.
I freeze. Has she seen through my thoughts?
％Ｂ
「You can't swim?」
Rikka
「No, I can, but...」
She doesn't say anything more.
It's a shame, but I guess I'll have to give up.
There's no point in forcing her to go if she won't enjoy herself.
％Ｂ
「Let's go somewhere else then.」
Rikka
「No, it's not like I don't want to go. I like the beach. Let's go.」

％Ｂ
「Uh... You sure?」
Rikka
「Yes, I want to go on a beach date with you.」
I probably shouldn't question her any further if she says it's okay.

I'd be wasting Rikka's kindness if I did.
If there is an issue, then she can just let me know.
We decide on a time and place to meet up for tomorrow.
％Ｂ
「Sigh... But man, exams end today...」
Rikka
「I'm surprised. I thought you didn't enjoy exams. You like them that much?」

％Ｂ
「No, I don't. I'm disappointed about breakfast. 'Cause I won't get to eat your cooking anymore...」

Rikka
「Would you like me to do keep doing it from now on?」
％Ｂ
「I'll accept just your feelings. I'd feel bad for making you do that, and I really need to become able to cook for myself.」

Rikka
「Then how about lunch?」
Rikka
「It's more or less the same amount of work to make two people's worth of lunch. If you're okay having the same food as me, that is. You could pay me for the ingredients.」


Rikka extends an easy-to-accept offer.
％Ｂ
「I'd love that. Fufufu. Now I won't feel anything when Shuuichi brags to me about his lunch.」

Rikka
「Hehe. Don't show them off to other people too much, okay?」
％Ｂ
「Of course. Your lunches are mine alone for both seeing and eating.」
Natsuki
「Hohoh, a love lunchbox? Sure sounds nice!」
all
％Ｂ
「...When'd you start listening in?」
Natsuki
「From around "'Cause I won't get to eat your cooking anymore～" It's your fault for talking in the classroom.」

Natsuki
「Still, Rikka doing that, eh? Though I guess it isn't surprising at aaall, considering how she's been like recently.」


％Ｂ
「How's she been like recently?」
Natsuki
「Oh, you wanna hear? She's been talking on LIME about you―」

Rikka
「Segawa-san!」
Natsuki
「Ahaha, don't worry. Of course I wouldn't tell. It's a secret between women.」

Rikka
「Geez...」
What the heck's Rikka saying to Segawa about me over LIME!?
I wanna ask, but she'd probably never tell...
Rikka
「Segawa-san. I'd like your advice on something. Do you have some time?」
Natsuki
「Of course. Are you finally prepared to take the next step forward?」
Rikka
「No! Um, I have a bit of a problem...」
Natsuki
「Let's step out of the classroom, then. Oh. Wanna come with to the bathroom?」

％Ｂ
「What the heck!」
all
Rikka and Segawa walk out, leaving me alone.
％Ｂ
「Phew... I think I'll do one final look-over before the exam.」
％Ｂ
「Dooooone～～～」
I stretch out in my chair after finishing all of my exams.
％Ｂ
「Rikka, let's go home together.」
Rikka
「Oh... I'm sorry, but I'm...」
Natsuki
「Tch, tch, tch. Sorry, but I've already made plans with her. She's going on a date with me today. Riiight?」

％Ｂ
「Gh... Again!?」
all
I stare at Rikka, trying my best to look pitiful.
Rikka
「I'm sorry.」
％Ｂ
「It's fine. You already made plans, so you should prioritize that.」
I wanted to go on a bit of a date on the way home after exams.

But, ah well.
I can't keep Rikka to myself.
I need to be happy about the fact that she's got Segawa as a friend.
％Ｂ
「Go have fun. Take care of Rikka for me, Segawa.」
Natsuki
「Well, aren't you understanding? I thought you'd be more disappointed.」

％Ｂ
「Of course I am. But I don't wanna tell her to not go hang out with you 'cause of that.」


Natsuki
「Well, expect good things, Mr. Boyfriend. You'll be on your knees before me in gratitude.」

％Ｂ
「Expect good things about what?」
Rikka
「Segawa-san, I'd like it if you wouldn't play things up too much...」

Natsuki
「Oh no, it's at least that good. I'll guarantee it. Anyway, bye-byeee!」
all
Segawa grabs Rikka's hand and starts pulling her along.
Rikka hurriedly grabs her bag and turns to me.
Rikka
「I'll be going... I'm looking forward to our date tomorrow. Bye-bye.」
％Ｂ
「Right. Have fun.」
all
Shuuichi
「...And so you came to me.」
％Ｂ
「Pretty much.」
Shuuichi
「I'm not a replacement for your girlfriend, you know. Sorry, but I'm busy. Go ask someone else.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, did you make plans with Kaori-san? Sorry, I wasn't really thinking.」
Shuuichi
「Kaori-san... Kaori-saaan!」
He sounds like he's going to cry.
This seems serious.
％Ｂ
「Wha, hey, what happened? You didn't break up, did you?」
Shuuichi
「You idiot! There's no way the love between Kaori-san and me would disappear so easily!」

％Ｂ
「Then what happened?」
Shuuichi
「She's apparently busy with preparing for her first-term exams for university. I haven't seen her in a week now...」

％Ｂ
「Ah～ ...That's a shame.」
％Ｂ
「But you'll see her once her exams are over, right? Let her know about all those lonely feelings you've been feeling.」


％Ｂ
「I bet Kaori-san'll listen to everything you've got to say.」
Shuuichi
「I see, yeah, you're right! ...I'm glad you're my friend, man.」
％Ｂ
「It's not a big deal. All right. How about we go to the kick target range today, then? It's been a while.」

Shuuichi
「Right! As two lonely guys who can't be with their girlfriends!」
We put our arms around each other's shoulders and start down the hallway.
％Ｂ
「Hahaha, yeah...」
Let's not tell him that I'm going on a date with Rikka tomorrow.
all
Rikka
「Thank you for coming shopping with me, Segawa-san.」
Natsuki
「This isn't a big deal. And now I know for sure he'll be on his knees before me for tomorrow.」

Rikka
「Hehe. I hope so, but I'm a little worried.」
Natsuki
「It'll be fine! It looked great on you! Be confident.」

Rikka
「Yes, you're right. You went through the effort of picking it out for me.」
all
I hope Ryousuke likes it.
I hope ％Ｂ likes it.
I can't help but smile when I imagine him smiling.
I almost walk past my destination doing so.
Rikka
「I'm sorry, Segawa-san, but I'll be...」
Natsuki
「Oh, you're going grocery shopping, right? Getting ingredients for lunch for your date tomorrow?」

Rikka
「Mhm. That, and for next week too.」
Rikka
「Mmm～ ...What do they have?」
I look at the flyer taped up on the supermarket bulletin board.
Chicken thigh is cheap...
Maybe I should make fried chicken. Ryousuke likes it.
Maybe I should make fried chicken. ％Ｂ likes it.
Making it tandoori chicken with curry powder sounds good too.
I hope he likes it.
Rikka
「The minced chicken's cheap too... Minced chicken on rice sounds good too. I could add some variety with scrambled egg...」

I've never thought so hard about what to make before...
And I've never had so much fun thinking about it.
Natsuki
「Oh my. That sounds like a lot of work, but you just look so happy.」
Rikka
「Because I am really happy.」
Rikka
「I'm happy when I'm deciding on what to get when I go out to eat with him, but it's really fun picking out what I should make while thinking about him.」


Natsuki
「Oh, is that how it is? Is that what it's like to have a boyfriend?」
Rikka
「I think it's more because 
Ryousuke
he
's my boyfriend instead of it being just because I have a boyfriend at all. I don't think I'd be able to feel this way with anyone other than 

Ryousuke
him
.」
Natsuki
「Thank you for that tasty morsel.」
Rikka
「Uuuh... I'm sorry. That was too much, wasn't it...?」
Natsuki
「When did I tell you to apologize!? There's nothing wrong at all with a friend of mine being happy!」

Segawa-san turns her usual sunny smile toward me.

I've begun to feel very fortunate for that recently.
I have friends who care about me, and a boyfriend who loves me.

Those things piling onto my everyday life are very precious, and I feel very blessed.

Natsuki
「So you should use that and make him just fall head over heels for you tomorrow! And don't forget to report back once your date's over!」


Rikka
「I'll do my best. Thank you so much for today, Segawa-san.」
all
Segawa-san waves grandly and goes running off.

I also wave back, though not as exuberantly as her.

Rikka
「I need to hurry and get my shopping done, so I can prepare for tomorrow.」
My hands tighten around the paper bag holding what Segawa-san and I picked out today.
