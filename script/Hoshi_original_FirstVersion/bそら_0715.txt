Yamashita-sensei
「You wish to have permission... to use a classroom in the old school building?」
％Ｂ
「Yes. Please let us use one!」
Sora
「...Please.」
We've come to the faculty office.
We're submitting a request to use an open classroom in the old school building as a staging area for making the dome.

all
The request is to be made to Yamashita-sensei, the extracurricular adviser.
He's pretty strict. We had a hard time convincing him back when we wanted to extend the astronomy club's hours too.

I think our request should be easy enough to grant, since Okihara-senpai's already using one of the rooms for her aquarium...


Yamashita-sensei
「You're constructing a dome for a planetarium... This is quite the undertaking.」

％Ｂ
「Yes. We searched for a wide-open room to build it in, and we arrived at the conclusion that one of the old school building's classrooms would be ideal.」

Yamashita-sensei
「Hm...」
％Ｂ
「We won't be using anything dangerous, and the work is relatively simple. All we need is a large classroom...」

Yamashita-sensei
「...」
％Ｂ
「Um... What do you think?」
Yamashita-sensei
「I quite like planetariums myself. I haven't been there recently, but I used to go to Shionagi's planetarium often.」

％Ｂ
「Did you really?」
Yamashita-sensei
「So the astronomy club will be making a planetarium. I'm looking forward to it.」
He stamps his approval on the request form.
Yamashita-sensei
「The construction may be a lot of work, but I wish you the best of luck.」
％Ｂ
「Y-Yes! We'll do our best!」
Sora
「...」
Yamashita-sensei
「...? Is something the matter?」
Sora
「...Please come see when it's done.」
Yamashita-sensei
「Yes, of course. I'm expecting good things.」
％Ｂ
「He's a nicer person than I thought.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
There are people out there who are looking forward to our planetarium.
Knowing that really gets us motivated.
％Ｂ
「All right, we've got a staging area now. What next?」

Sora
「...We make templates for the cardboard shapes.」
％Ｂ
「Templates, huh? We'll need vellum paper, then. Is the stuff they sell at the school store good enough?」

Sora
「...*nod*」
We pick up some vellum paper at the school store and head to one of the classrooms in the old school building.
We used some of the astronomy club's remaining club funds to buy the vellum paper.
％Ｂ
「So how do we make the templates?」
Sora
「...I'll do the math now.」
all
She starts writing out formulas on the chalkboard.
Sora
「...The dome's six meters in diameter, so the maximum circumference is approximately 1,884 centimeters.」

Sora
「...It'll be hard to gather the cardboard if the templates are too big, so we're going to split it into thirty-six vertical parts.」

％Ｂ
「...」
Sora
「Thirty-six isosceles triangles with a base length of 52 centimeters maximum. We split those further into nine parts horizontally.」

She's not saying all this as an explanation to me, but rather to herself to make sure she's doing the calculations right as she writes the numbers out on the board.


Sora
「...Which means we need 324 parts to make one dome.」
She starts drawing the isosceles triangles that form the base on the vellum paper after finishing her calculations.

Sora
「...The biggest parts are going to be 52 by 52 centimeters... The trapezoids get narrower from that point...」

My girlfriend sure is smart...
I'm pretty good at these kinds of calculations myself, but I don't even approach Sora's speed.

Also, I've done absolutely nothing so far...
all
Wait a second, is getting permission from Yamashita-sensei the only thing I'm going to do today...?

％Ｂ
「...Let's start heading out, Sora.」
It's already dark out.
％Ｂ
「We didn't put in a request for extended club hours today. Let's continue tomorrow.」

Sora
「...I'm going to go buy plastic boards tomorrow.」
％Ｂ
「Plastic boards? What are you gonna do with those?」
Sora
「...They'll be the templates.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, I get it. For cutting the cardboard, right? So the vellum paper from earlier is for getting those plastic boards shaped right.」

Sora
「...I want to go buy them together tomorrow after school.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, of course.」
％Ｂ
「...」
Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「...That was me just now.」
Sora
「...Hungry?」
％Ｂ
「My bad... I didn't even do that much work. Wanna get burgers on the way back again?」

Sora
「...*shake shake*」
Huh?
That usually makes her happy.
Sora
「...I want to eat at your house.


」
％Ｂ
「Uh... My house?」
Sora
「...I'll cook.」
％Ｂ
「Seriously?」
Sora
「...You don't want me to?」
％Ｂ
「Of course I do! I'm super happy! But why so suddenly?」

Sora
「...I think you're not eating properly because you live alone.」
％Ｂ
「Ah... I get it.」
She's apparently worried about my dietary habits.
I can cook for myself, so it's not that bad.
But there's no reason for me to decline her offer to cook for me.

％Ｂ
「Isn't your family gonna be worried if you stay out late?」
Sora
「...No issues.」
She pulls out her phone and starts typing up a message.
Sora
「...I told them I'd be late because of club. No issues.」
all
And so I've brought Sora to my house.
This is the third time she's come over.
Maybe she's gotten a little more used to it. She doesn't seem as nervous as last time.
Sora
「...Are you really sure we didn't need to get any groceries?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. I've still got a decent amount of stuff left in the fridge.」
Sora said she wanted to go to the supermarket for groceries on the way home.\n \n\r
But I didn't really think she needed to spend money, so I asked her to make something using the ingredients I already have at home.

％Ｂ
「You can use whatever you want in the fridge. Let me know if there's anything else you need. I've got most things around the house.」


Sora
「...*nod* Any requests?」
％Ｂ
「Mmm... I'll leave it up to the chef.」
Sora
「...*nod* I'll handle it.」
She rolls up her sleeves and gets to work.
I'm looking forward to seeing what she'll make for me.
all
Sora
「...Done.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, you're done? Let's see here... Wait... Whoa!?」
I rear back in surprise when I see the food on the table.
％Ｂ
「Y-You made... omurice...!?」
And it isn't the kiddy kind that's just a thin layer of fried egg wrapped around chicken rice.

％Ｂ
「...Is this the kind where the melty egg comes spilling out when I break open the top?」

Sora
「...*nod*」
I've seen a restaurant chef make one like this on TV...

％Ｂ
「And this sauce... this isn't just ketchup, right?」
Sora
「...Demi-glace sauce.」
％Ｂ
「I didn't have anything like this at home. You didn't make this yourself, did you?」

Sora
「I mixed together ketchup, worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, butter, flour, instant coffee... and freeze-dried onion soup.」

％Ｂ
「W-Wow, you sure put a lot of effort into this...」
She's even nailed the presentation, with a few curved lines painted onto the plate with the sauce. It's beautiful.

The plates I always use seem so luxurious now.

This isn't just omurice anymore.
It's like I've been served three-star French cuisine!
Sora
「...Omurice, planetary orbit preparation. Nebula style.」



...Other than the name, at least.
Sora
「...The lines of sauce symbolize planetary orbits.」
％Ｂ
「...Thanks for the explanation.」
all
％Ｂ
「Oh... It's...」
There are little dots of sauce in addition to the planetary orbits.
Aren't these...?
％Ｂ
「This is a constellation, isn't it? This shape is... Cygnus.」
Sora
「...Mm.」
Sora gives me a thumbs-up.
Looks like I got it right.
％Ｂ
「Man, there's so much detail. It feels like a waste to eat.」
Sora
「...You need to eat it before it gets cold.」
％Ｂ
「Of course... Well, it's a bit of a waste... but let's dig in!」

all
I grab a spoon and break open the omelet.
％Ｂ
「Wow!」
The liquid egg spills out from inside and seeps into the chicken rice.
A delicious smell wafts toward me.
％Ｂ
「I've never had omurice like this before... Hamh... mgmgh...」
Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「Gulp... It's delicious! This is amazing, Sora! It's so good!」
Sora
「...I'm glad.」
％Ｂ
「You should eat before it gets cold too.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
Sora
「...Hamh... Ngngh... Gulp... Came out great.」
％Ｂ
「Ahhh! I could totally eat this three times a day!」

Sora
「...Hehe...」
Sora smiles happily.
all
Sora's special omurice was so good that it took us no time at all to finish it.

We stand next to each other in front of the sink to do the dishes together.
％Ｂ
「Phew... Let's take a bit of a break. I'll make some tea. Want some?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「Just a sec, then.」
all
I make tea for her.
％Ｂ
「Here you go. It's hot, so don't burn yourself, all right?」
Sora
「...Thanks.」
I place the mugs on the table and sit down.
Sora
「...」
Sora grabs her mug and walks up to me.

％Ｂ
「Oh...」
She plops herself down into a seat and smiles at me.
...She's so cute.
％Ｂ
「...Uhh... Thanks for the omurice. It was really great.」

Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「You gotta teach me how to make it sometime. I wanna try making it myself.」
Sora
「...*shake shake*」
％Ｂ
「Uh... You won't?」
Sora
「...If you learn how to make it, then I won't be able to come make it for you anymore.」




％Ｂ
「...You're right. Come over and make this for me again, then.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
Sora
「...I'll come anytime if it'll make you happy.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah... Thanks, Sora.」
Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「...」
...The conversation's started running dry again.
all
I idly drink some tea.
％Ｂ
「Hot! Hot, hot...」
It was hotter than I thought.
％Ｂ
「My bad, Sora. The tea's hotter than I thought, so be careful when you...」

Sora
「...」
She's sticking her tongue out, looking like she's about to cry.
％Ｂ
「Or... I guess I'm too late...」
Sora
「...Hot.」
％Ｂ
「You burn your tongue? Here, let me see.」
Sora
「...Nnh...」
She sticks out her tongue just a little bit from between her lips.
％Ｂ
「Oh yeah... It's a little red...」
Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「...」
...Sora's reddened tongue is strangely seductive.

％Ｂ
「...Sora...」
I kiss her without thinking, placing her entire tongue in my mouth.
Sora
「Fh, nh... mmh... Nnh～～～」
I can feel her tense up for an instant.
But she relaxes right away and―
Sora
「...Chu... mmh, nh～～ Chlh...」
She accepts the kiss, letting me take control.
Sora
「Nh... Fh, nh... nnh... Mh～～ nnnh...」
％Ｂ
「Pf, hah... Sora...」
Sora
「...Hah, ah...」
Sora's eyes are already damp just from a little kissing.
Her lips might be her on/off switch.
I can tell that my heart's beating faster, but I play it cool.

％Ｂ
「So... wanna come up to my room?」
Sora should know what I mean by that.
Sora
「...*nod*」
She blushes, looks downward, and nods.
