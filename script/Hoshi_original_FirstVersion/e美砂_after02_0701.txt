「...」
I'm staring at Marinpia's exterior.
They've started cleaning off the walls already. I'm sure it's only going to get even more impressive as the reopening approaches.

But...
Misa
「Sigh...」
Misa steps outside from the front doors.
She looks depressed, and she's walking uneasily.
％Ｂ
「Had a long day?」
Misa
「...Yes, I have.」
％Ｂ
「How'd it go?」
Misa
「...Not well.」
％Ｂ
「I see... So it didn't work out.」
I figured as much, from the way she left the building.

all
Today was the day for the staff presentations for the hallway display at Marinpia.

Misa pushed for the "sea of jellies" using the concept art I drew and some jellyfish art that she drew herself, but it looks like it failed.


％Ｂ
「So what's it going to be then?」
Misa
「Well, there was no collective decision for any of the other proposals either, so there was no decision made. It has been deferred until next time.」


％Ｂ
「Deferred... You don't need to be so down, then. We've still got another chance.」

Misa
「Yes, but... things aren't going very well.」
％Ｂ
「...Yeah.」
I thought it over until the very last moment too...
But I couldn't come up with the kind of clear concept that Azuma-san would usually want. I was painfully brought to terms with my own lack of ability.

％Ｂ
「We gotta make the concept something more concrete. What we have right now isn't really a complete display...」

Misa
「Yes, that's true... It's like we don't quite know which we want... between showing off the jellyfish or creating a soothing place...」


％Ｂ
「And putting chairs down might've been too cheap of an idea too.」

Misa
「But I do think the idea of watching the tanks while sitting down is wonderful. It would be nice to incorporate that...」


％Ｂ
「I see... Hmm...」
I feel like the more I think about it, the more I get stuck...
％Ｂ
「...Hey. How about we go back to square one?」
Misa
「What? ...Back to square one? What do you mean by that?」
％Ｂ
「You wannna show the people who come to Marinpia new surprises and yet-unheard-of wonder, right?」

Misa
「Yes, of course!」
％Ｂ
「I was most moved by Marinpia when I came back here and you guided me through the building, not when I went here back when I was a kid.」


％Ｂ
「There wasn't anyone other than you and me there back then. There were even some tanks that were already emptied.」

％Ｂ
「But when I walked around the aquarium while I was listening to your narration... I really was moved.」

％Ｂ
「That's why... I think... getting to taste that feeling again might be some kind of a hint.」

％Ｂ
「So could you guide me through right now? I want you to narrate things like you did back then.」

Misa
「I see... I see, I see! I understand. Then I shall guide you!」

Misa
「Though it will not be much of a tour, since our tanks do not have any water in them. Which of course means there are no fish either. Is that all right?」

％Ｂ
「Of course. I don't mind. If anything, I feel like that might only make things more difficult for you.」

Misa
「I will be fine. I remember all of the tank placements.」
％Ｂ
「...Wouldn't expect anything less.」
Misa
「Now then, let us go...」
Misa
「Welcome to Marinpia Shionagi. I will be guiding you today. Please allow me... to take you to a deep blue world.」


％Ｂ
「Ohh...」
Those words are enough to bring how I felt back then to mind.
Misa
「4.6 billion years ago, Earth was a planet of fire. The surface was covered in superhot magma, and the atmosphere was comprised of volcanic gases.」


Misa
「At some point, the temperature began to fall. The magma hardened, and the water vapor in the atmosphere became rain and fell onto the surface.」


％Ｂ
「...」
The same dim lighting as back then.
There were still at least a few fish left in the tanks the last time.
...But there aren't any at all right now.
But Misa still explains the contents of the tanks, as if there really were fish swimming around energetically inside.

Misa
「It rained for thousands of years. Minerals dissolved into the water over the course of ten million years. Eventually, tiny cells were born in the life-giving mixture...」


Her voice gently sounds through the blue world.
Misa
「Our far-distant ancestors were born here. You and I both have our origins in this deep blue sea.」

There shouldn't be any water in those tanks, but there is.
Suddenly, there are vividly colored fish swimming about inside the tanks.
The interior of the aquarium's lit by the blue light reflecting off the water. It's like we're walking along the sea floor.

It feels like I'm drifting through the water with Misa.
It's starting to feel like a dream.
I might've honestly wandered into a real dream.
I follow along comfortably toward a small hallway.
Misa
「Welcome to the sea of jellies.」
This tank should be empty, but it's filled with water, and there are white jellyfish floating daintily through the water.

Misa
「Jellyfish were first born before the Cambrian explosion that led to the evolution of most other animals. They are a reminder of what life was like in its most primitive form.」


Misa
「Jellyfish have floated through the sea like this for six hundred million years. While other creatures continued the hectic process of evolution... they have simply continued to float and propel themselves through the water.」


％Ｂ
「...」
I remember the dream I had before as I listen to her words.

...
......
.........
Is this... a dream?
Misa and I are holding each other tight as we move through the ocean.
Drifting through the water, rocked by the gentle waves...
Is this Shionagi's sea...?
Or is it Okinawa...?
I guess it doesn't matter...
Still, this is really comfortable.
I feel like I've felt this kind of comfort before, a long time ago... Where was that again...?

Drifting, drifting...
Oh, right... It was inside my mother's belly...
It feels the same way as back when I was enveloped in amniotic fluid...
...Wait, what?
How do I even remember something like that?
There's no way...
So I guess this has to be a dream after all...
％Ｂ
「...」
The shape of primordial life...
Both Misa and I have our origins in this deep blue sea...
％Ｂ
「...The primordial... sea...」
Misa
「What? ...Did you say something?」
％Ｂ
「Uh... It was vague... but I feel like I had an idea just now...」

Misa
「Did you really? What kind of idea?」
％Ｂ
「Uhh... I dunno how to describe it...」
all
I look up at the ceiling, thinking.
％Ｂ
「...Oh! Right...」
I look at Misa.
％Ｂ
「...This might be a crazy idea. But could you hear me out, without thinking about realizability or budget?」


Misa
「Y-Yes... Of course.」
％Ｂ
「I wanna look at the blueprints while I think it over. Could you come to the firm with me right now?」

Misa
「Right now? I don't particularly mind...」

％Ｂ
「Then let's go!」
Misa and I arrive at the firm.
Looks like Azuma-san's gone home already.
％Ｂ
「Oh, come in.」
Misa
「...I-I apologize for the intrusion～」
She hesitantly follows after me.
％Ｂ
「You can sit here.」
all
I gesture to a seat next to my desk, and I unfold the design blueprints for Marinpia.

％Ｂ
「...Yeah... I don't think it'd be impossible.」
I take out a sketchbook and start sketching out concept art of my idea.

Misa
「...」
Misa just sits and watches me.
％Ｂ
「We might've been too specific with the "sea of jellies."」
all
I speak as I continue sketching.
％Ｂ
「You're right that jellyfish are soothing to watch, and I think they're pretty too. But that just wouldn't be enough. It'd get boring quick.」

％Ｂ
「The issue's with the concept. It shouldn't end with just seeing the jellyfish...」

％Ｂ
「The visitors should be able to melt away into the mood there, and be soothed by just the ambiance... If we could make a place like that...」


Misa
「The visitors should be able to melt away into the mood there...」
I show Misa the finished sketch.
％Ｂ
「The concept is... The origin of life. The "primordial sea."」

Misa
「...!」
％Ｂ
「We're gonna make an ocean in that hallway. And not just any ocean. An ocean like a mother's womb.」

％Ｂ
「It's gonna be a place where anyone who visits can be soothed and relaxed, as if they were a baby in the womb.」

Misa
「Is this... a water tank in the ceiling?」
％Ｂ
「That's right. There's gonna be a big, circular window to a water tank on the ceiling. That's where the jellyfish are gonna be.」

％Ｂ
「And there's gonna be a huge, cushy sofa in the middle of the hall. A really fluffy and soft one.」


％Ｂ
「The visitors are gonna lie down on it and look up at the jellyfish tank.」

Misa
「I see... I see, I see... Yes, then the guests would not get in each other's way for viewing the tanks.」

％Ｂ
「To be honest, I want it all to be water tanks, from the ceiling to the walls. Otherwise, people are gonna have to wait for their turn on the sofa.」

％Ｂ
「But if we make it all water tanks, there's no way we'd have the budget...」
Misa
「...Then perhaps we could surround this sofa with a cylindrical water tank?」

％Ｂ
「A cylindrical tank?」
Misa
「Yes. The cylinder would be connected with the ceiling tank... and the jellyfish would be free to traverse between the tanks.」

Misa
「That way, you can still see the jellyfish without having to lay on the sofa.」

％Ｂ
「That's a great idea.」
I immediately start sketching out Misa's idea.
％Ｂ
「Like this?」
Misa
「We should change the lighting too! I think we could add a dreamlike feel by having the lighting change over time, and make it a much more wonderful place that way.」


％Ｂ
「The lighting, huh? Then we gotta have BGM too. Some gentle sounds that make you think of the ocean...」

New ideas pop up one after another. I can hardly believe we were having such a hard time coming up with ideas earlier.

％Ｂ
「What should the name be, instead of the "sea of jellies"?」

Misa
「Let's see... Then how about something like this?」
all
She grabs a pen and writes something into the sketchbook.
Misa
「The "primordial sea: jellyfish-rium"!」
％Ｂ
「"Primordial sea: jellyfish-rium"... I like it! Yeah, let's go with this!」

Misa
「I think this will become a very wonderful place!」
The two of us high-five in satisfaction. We've drafted out the first concept for the jellyfish-rium.
