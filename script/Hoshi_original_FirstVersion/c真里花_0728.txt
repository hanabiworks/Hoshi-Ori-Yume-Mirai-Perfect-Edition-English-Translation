Sora
「...Ooh.」
That's rare. Ousaka made a sound without meaning to.
But it's not just Ousaka. Everyone watching voices their appreciation.
％Ｂ
「Wow, it's so pretty...」
Misa
「You're right. It's wonderful!」
We're all looking up at the classroom ceiling.
It's illuminated by a beautiful starry sky.
There's still only about 60 percent of the stars we want in total... but it's still incredibly pretty.

Natsuki
「This is going to be amazing when it's done.」

Touko
「I guess all our efforts are going to be worth it.」
％Ｂ
「That's right. Hard work always pays off. And this just goes to show that you should always aim high.」

Rikka
「You're right. We wouldn't have gotten to see a sight like this if we had tried to go for fewer stars because of effort and time.」


％Ｂ
「And this is only 60 percent.」
all
This'll rival actual planetariums at this rate.
But this display isn't going to be just the planetarium.
That's just half of it.
I just know that it'll be an amazing place once it's combined with the aquarium!

Marika
「I'm sorry I'm late～ Wah!!」
Marika's late because of work. She's staring up at the stars on the ceiling in wonder.
Marika
「Th-This is amazing～ ...It's so pretty...」
％Ｂ
「We tried projecting them to see how it'd look. Better than you expected, isn't it?」
Marika
「It was worth all the effort～! I'm looking forward to seeing it finished.」

all
Rikka
「Hehe. Everyone's saying the same thing.」
Narusawa's giggling.
But that just means that it's well made enough that everyone's just that surprised.
Which means that any guests will react the same way.
...No. This isn't finished yet, so their reaction will be even better.
all
％Ｂ
「All right! Let's get cracking!」
Marika
「And then we got kicked out again...」
％Ｂ
「That we did.」
We were working even after the others went home... but we got too into it and got kicked out after it got late.

Marika
「Are you going to work on it at home again?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. I'm feeling like doing a little more today.」
Those stars from our test projection are still burnt into my mind.
I really want to complete it as soon as I can.
Marika
「Can I come over again, then?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, of course.」
％Ｂ
「Okay. Something like this.」
Marika
「...」
％Ｂ
「Hm?」
I thought Marika was being quiet. I look to see her nodding off.
％Ｂ
「You all right?」
Marika
「...Huh? Oh, sorry... I fell asleep for a bit...」

％Ｂ
「You're tired, right?」
We've been working for about two hours since we got home.
Of course she's tired. We've been doing this all day.
Marika
「But I was late today, so...」
％Ｂ
「You can't help being late because of work. And that just means it makes more sense for you to be tired.」

％Ｂ
「It's okay if you go home, you know.」
Marika
「I'm really okay. I need to do a little more work.」

％Ｂ
「You should rest for a bit, then. Here, lie down.」

Marika
「Waaahh～」
all
I force her to lie down.
I position her so her head's on my lap.
Marika
「Th-This is embarrassing... It's a lap pillow...」
％Ｂ
「I hear even a little bit of sleep does a lot for you when you're tired. You know, like how they say afternoon naps are important and stuff.」

Marika
「It's already nighttime, you know.」
％Ｂ
「Nighttime naps, then.」
Marika
「It's normal to sleep at night～ Hehe... Fwah...」
She laughs, and then immediately yawns a little.

％Ｂ
「See? You're sleepy.」
Marika
「Your lap's really comfy. It reminds me of back when my mom would do this for me when I was a kid.」


％Ｂ
「Your mom gave you lap pillows?」
Marika
「She did them when she cleaned my ears when I was little.」
％Ｂ
「Oh yeah, I remember stuff like that too. Though my dad did it more for me.」

Marika
「Huh～ Your dad? It'd be nice if you could get along that well with my dad...」

％Ｂ
「...No, I think that'd be a bit weird.」
I dunno what to think about a guy who has his girlfriend's dad clean his ears...
％Ｂ
「Anyway, want me to clean your ears, then?」
Marika
「What? No, you don't have to... It's kind of embarrassing, too...」
％Ｂ
「It's fine, it's fine. I actually have an ear pick right here.」

There's one nearby, since I used it yesterday.
I reach out and grab it, with Marika's head still on my lap.
Marika
「Whaaat～? ...Are you really going to do it?」
％Ｂ
「Don't worry, I'm pretty good at it. My dad made me clean his ears in exchange for him cleaning mine.」

I insert the ear pick into her ear as I talk.
Marika
「Aahn... Th-That tickles... Nh...」
％Ｂ
「...Stop making weird sounds.」
Marika
「I'm not making weird sooounds. But it feels good, so... nnh...」

She makes sexy moans every time.
Though her ears are clean, so I'm not really doing much.
I barely see any wax.
So I just move the pick gently, stroking it against her skin.
Marika
「Nnh... Aah, nnh...」
％Ｂ
「...」
The way she twists just a bit is so seductive...
％Ｂ
「Um, hey... You're gonna start making me feel weird if you keep moaning like that...」

Marika
「Huh? I told you, I'm not making any sounds... But... you can't today.」

％Ｂ
「Uh... R-Really?」
Did I do something? I'm worried.
Marika
「Because... I sweat lots today...」
％Ｂ
「Sweat? What, that's all?」
Marika
「No, it's a huge problem. It's embarrassing...」

％Ｂ
「Then...」
Marika
「Huh?」
％Ｂ
「Why not just take a bath here again? You can wear your swimsuit if you're embarrassed...」

Marika
「A-Aaahh～...」
Marika blushes at my suggestion.

Marika
「Thanks for walking me.」
％Ｂ
「It's gotten really late. You sure you'll be okay?」

Marika
「I hope my dad's not home yet... but it'll be annoying if he's there, so you can go home.」

％Ｂ
「No, I can't just do that. I should at least say hi now that it's this late.」

Marika
「Mmm, I hope this goes okay...」
Kouji
「Just what were you doing out this late?」
all
％Ｂ
「Agh...!」
It just had to be her dad right off the bat!?
Kouji
「What's that "Agh" for?」
％Ｂ
「I-I'm very sorry...」
I'm already apologizing.
I'm really not good at dealing with her dad.
Yumi
「Oh, well hello. Did you walk her home?」

Marika
「Oh, Mom. Yeah, he walked me all the way back.」

all
Kouji
「Of course he did. Just look how late it is.」
％Ｂ
「I-I'm sorry...」
Marika
「I already told you I'd be late, didn't I～? We were making the planetarium for our display for the Tanabata Festival.」

Kouji
「The Tanabata Festival's a school event, isn't it? What do you have to do this late?」

Marika
「Don't talk about things you don't know anything about, Dad. The stargazing aquarium that he designed is amazing.」

all
Kouji
「Stargazing aquarium? What's that? He designed that?」

％Ｂ
「No, it wasn't just me. We're all making it together...」
Marika
「It's super pretty. I think everyone who sees it is going to be really impressed.」

Kouji
「Uh... I-I bet it's just something you'd find at a cultural festival anyway. I'm sure you have other, more important things to do. Like your summer homework.」


Marika
「I am doing my homework bit by bit every day～!」
Marika's voice grows louder.
But... hearing her defend the stargazing aquarium like that kinda makes me happy.

That's why I softly step in front of Marika, interrupting the argument that's been heating up before me.

all
％Ｂ
「Um, Father!!!」
Kouji
「Ohhhh!? What are you shouting for...? And wait... Father!?」


％Ｂ
「Yes, Marika-san's father! I... have a request for you.」

％Ｂ
「Could I ask you to please come see our stargazing aquarium!?」
Kouji
「Whaaat!?」
％Ｂ
「We're serious about the work we're putting into this. I'm sure you'll understand if you see it for yourself. So I'd like to ask you to come see it on the day of the Tanabata Festival.」


Kouji
「You want me to come see it...!? Why would I come see something you made...?」
Marika
「I'm making it too, you know. But you still won't see it?」

Kouji
「No, of course I will! I'd be happy to go see something you've put your heart into making!」

all
Yumi
「You're flip-flopping too much, dear.」
Kouji
「Q-Quiet! It's for my adorable daughter!」
So this is what being a father is like...
Kouji
「Fine, I'll see it. But if I come see it and it's something idiotic, then I won't forgive you.」


Yumi
「And what happens if you don't forgive him?」
Kouji
「Isn't it obvious!? He'll have to give up his... well, uh... his friendship with Marika!」


％Ｂ
「What?」
Marika
「What's that supposed to mean? I don't need your permission to be friends with him, Dad.」

all
Kouji
「W-Well... A-Anyway, I won't forgive you if it's a stupid display!」
He raises his voice in apparent desperation.
％Ｂ
「...I understand.」
I'll definitely have to give this my all, then.
But I know it'll be okay.
I recall the starry sky we projected onto the classroom ceiling today.
I know that we can make something amazing by combining that with the aquarium!
I'm sure that all of the guests, including her dad, will acknowledge that.
Marika
「Let's do our best, Ryousuke-kun!」
Marika
「Let's do our best!」
％Ｂ
「Yeah!」
all
Yumi
「...It seems to me that you're only strengthening their bond by opposing them.」

Kouji
「Th-That's not truuuuuuuee!!!」
