「Zzz... Zzz...」
...Poke, poke.
％Ｂ
「Fueh?」
％Ｂ
「Wha, Narusawa...」
Rikka
「It's lunch break.」
％Ｂ
「Oh... Okay. Looks like you had to wake me up again.」

I got a good amount of sleep last night, but I guess it wasn't enough.
Rikka
「Were you painting again?」
％Ｂ
「Oh, right.」
I haven't told Narusawa yet about what happened yesterday.
I should definitely do that, after she helped us out and all.
Rikka
「Did it go well?」
She asks me how it went before I get the chance to tell her.
She was probably able to tell from how I was acting.
％Ｂ
「Yeah, thanks to all of you. Thanks for helping yesterday.」

Rikka
「It's not a big deal. I only helped a little. And...」


Rikka
「It was a bit fun.」
％Ｂ
「I'm glad to hear it. I had fun with you too, Narusawa.」

Rikka
「...But I still haven't gotten the paint out from under my nails.」
％Ｂ
「Oh. You're right.」
Her fingertips are still dirty with paint.

％Ｂ
「But you know... You've got real pretty fingers, Narusawa.」
Rikka
「...You're staring too much.」
％Ｂ
「R-Right. Sorry. Anyway, you should use the art club's soap.」

Rikka
「It's fine. It'll come out eventually.」

％Ｂ
「It wouldn't look good to have paint on your fingers when you play piano, right?」

Rikka
「No one's going to look.」
％Ｂ
「Hmm... Really?」
I guess there's no need to force the issue if she herself doesn't mind.
％Ｂ
「You're unexpectedly okay with that kinda stuff. I figured people who do music would be more against it.」

Rikka
「That just depends on the person. I don't mind.」

％Ｂ
「Could you help me out again, then?」
Rikka
「...Again?」
％Ｂ
「I wanna make what we drew into reality this time.」

％Ｂ
「Your sense of aesthetics really helped us out. So could you lend a hand again?」

Rikka
「...I'll think about it.」
I figured she'd say no, but I asked just in case. So that was an unexpected response.

％Ｂ
「Think it over seriously then, all right?」
Rikka
「I will.」
It'd be great if Narusawa helped us out.
And it'd be more fun if we had lots of people working together.
But there's still one more thing I need to do.
I need to get the school to give me permission.
I've never walked into the school building so openly before.
It's because I have teachers with me today.
Teacher A
「Ohh, so this is it.」
The teachers express surprise when they see the diagram of the "stargazing aquarium" put up against the blackboard.

I had already told them about it beforehand, but I guess they weren't expecting it to be that big.

I knew it was a good idea to show them.
We made it to convince Yukimura, but if it was able to do that, then it might be able to convince the teachers, too...


That was the idea I had.
Because just looking at this makes what we want to do obvious.
Marika
「U-Umm～ ...What do you think?」
all
Teacher B
「But... are you really going to make this? Is that even possible?」

I knew they'd ask that.
We're confident in our vision.
But our vision's so impressive that it makes it hard to believe that we'll be able to actually make it into reality.

％Ｂ
「Yes, we can. The naturalist and astronomy clubs may not have many members, but they make up for it in knowledge.」


％Ｂ
「And more than anything, both clubs are full of passion. I think we'll be able to make it very legitimate.」

Teacher B
「But even with the event committee supporting them, will they really be able to make such a grand display?」

％Ｂ
「That's why it's a combined plan. We can focus our manpower this way, and use our budget more efficiently.」


％Ｂ
「I'm sure that we can create an entirely new experience by combining the concepts of an aquarium and a planetarium.」

I explain myself confidently.
This is one of the tenets of presenting your ideas.
You have to make sure you seem confident.
Teacher C
「Hmm, but still...」
％Ｂ
「We require a wide-open space in order to create this. And this old school building is the only place with the space we require.」

Teacher A
「I see what you mean, considering how big this is going to be.」
％Ｂ
「Right? And so...」
Teacher B
「But this area is off limits. Once we allow one exception, then more students will come asking the same.」


Teacher C
「And that may lead to unnecessary trouble...」
Marika
「Aww～ But...」
all
Teacher A
「No, we really do think it's an incredible plan. But as for giving you permission... Well...」

The other teachers are nodding along.
Crap. Things aren't looking good.
I need to do something...
％Ｂ
「Oh...」
And that's when Yukimura just happens to show up.
She really seems like she just happened to wander across this scene.
Marika
「Yukimura-san?」
Yukimura walks straight up to the teachers and stops in front of them.
Teacher A
「Hm? Yukimura, are you a part of this too?」
Touko
「There's something I'd like for you to all see.」
Yukimura doesn't answer the teacher's question.
Touko
「This way.」
all
And then she just walks away without waiting for a response.
％Ｂ
「Hey, where are you going?」
Marika
「Let's just follow for now. Teachers, please, you too.」

Teacher B
「Y-Yes.」
Yukimura's at the end of the hallway.
In front of an old locker.
all
Teacher C
「Oh, now this is nostalgic. This was still here?」

A few of the teachers look fondly at it.
They must be the veterans among the teachers.
Teacher B
「This can't be opened because the key is broken, right?」
He rattles the lid, and it indeed doesn't open.
The lock seems to be stuck in the closed position.
Touko
「It's not locked. There's just a trick to opening it.」
Yukimura steps out and reaches out toward the locker.
all
She lifts it up, and then slowly pulls.
Click...
Marika
「Oh. It opened.」
Teacher A
「Ohh, you're right.」
Touko
「Please look inside.」
Teacher B
「Inside?」
all
The teachers look inside curiously. I peer in as well.

％Ｂ
「It's...」
It's not empty.
In fact, it's full.
It's filled with...
％Ｂ
「Signature cards?」
Touko
「That's right. Signature cards. Looks like they were left here by students who graduated.」


Marika
「You're right. It's all signatures and messages.」
all
There are tons and tons of signature cards. Some old and yellowed, some still new-looking.
\n\r
They're overflowing with memories and dreams.
Discussing the fun they had at this school.
Words promising unending friendship.
Dreams for the future.
There are tons of emotions stuffed into all of the signatures.

Teacher C
「They did something like this...」
The teachers read each and every one of the names, looking touched.
It looks like the teachers had no idea that these existed.
This must've been a tradition since a long time ago, judging by the amount and their condition.
It might've come about spontaneously.
Before graduating, they all secretly placed their memories into a locker in the old school building that was supposed to be torn down at some point.

This locker's filled with sentimentality.

Touko
「There are lots of people's good memories still living in this old school building.」

all
Teacher A
「I never knew... All of them thought so much of...」
Huh? Is he... tearing up?
Touko
「It's going to be torn down next year anyway, so why not at least open it back up for Tanabata?」

Touko
「I've heard that Tanabata is a special day in this city.」
all
A wind blows as she says so.
I don't know where it came from, but the building shivers a little in the wind.
It almost feels like the building's responding to Yukimura's words.
Shuuichi
「They've apparently agreed to discuss the usage of the old school building in the next weekly faculty meeting.」

Shuuichi
「The more veteran teachers, including the vice principal, are apparently leaning toward allowing it, so we're pretty much guaranteed to get permission.」

％Ｂ
「It's all thanks to Yukimura.」
all
Touko
「No, I didn't do anything.」
Marika
「No, it's all thanks to you～! You convinced all of the teachers by swaying their hearts!」

Touko
「I just pointed out the truth.」
all
Yukimura's totally composed.
But there's also more good news.
Yukimura says she'll help out with the stargazing aquarium too.
％Ｂ
「...Don't be like, "Actually, I'm bored of it," all right?」
Touko
「I'm not a child. I'll follow through on what I said. Plus, it looks a bit fun!」


She smiles mischievously.
Huh. I didn't know she had a smile like that.
all
Natsuki
「Anyway, so that means we won't be able to do anything until we get a final verdict after the faculty meeting at the start of next week.」

Sora
「Kind of frustrating.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah... It really is.」
all
I'm totally raring to go.
I don't want to let these feelings cool off while I'm forced to wait.
％Ｂ
「Is there anything we can do right now?」
A hand shoots up.
It's Okihara-senpai's.
Misa
「There is something.」
Her eyes gleam.
They look like tiny little oceans.
Misa
「Let's all gather up the fish for the aquarium!」
