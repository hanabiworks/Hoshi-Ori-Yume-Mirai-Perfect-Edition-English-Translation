「Zzz... Zzz...」
Natsuki
「Zzz... Nh... nnhh...」
％Ｂ
「Nnnh...」
Natsuki
「...Morniiinh... What... time is it...?」
％Ｂ
「Nnnh... It's still a little past six...」
Natsuki
「...We can sleep a little more then.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah... Fuaaahh...」
Natsuki
「Or... do you wanna do it again?」
％Ｂ
「No... Doing it in the morning isn't good 'cause we lose track of time... I'm still a new hire, so I've gotta be at work before everyone else―」

Natsuki
「...Gasp!?」
％Ｂ
「Hm... What's up?」
Natsuki
「...I need to go to the studio early today!」
％Ｂ
「Wha...?」
Natsuki runs into the living room after getting ready.
Natsuki
「Uhh, my key, my key... Huh? Where is it? Why can't I find my moped key now of all times!?」

％Ｂ
「Calm down. You sure you didn't leave it in your pocket after you got back from work yesterday?」


Natsuki
「My pocket... Oh, I found it! Nice catch!」
％Ｂ
「And here, take this!」
I hand her a pouch.
％Ｂ
「Rice balls for breakfast. Eat them once you're there. It's umeboshi and bonito.」

Natsuki
「Thanks! I love you!」
She walks up to me and gives me a goodbye kiss.
Natsuki
「Mmm... chu♪ I'm going, then!」
％Ｂ
「Watch out for cars!」
Natsuki
「Oh, and I'm gonna go to your firm today first thing in the afternoon!」

％Ｂ
「Huh? To my work? I don't remember you having an appointment. I never heard anything about this.」

Natsuki
「My boss should've sent yours mail about it. We're apparently meeting to discuss photos for presentation documents.」

％Ｂ
「Got it. I'll make sure he knows.」
Natsuki
「Thanks! I'm going, then!」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, have a good day!」
all
The front door slams shut, and I can hear the moped's engine start up right away.

％Ｂ
「All right. I need to start getting ready to go too.」
I hope Azuma-san knows that we're going to be having guests today...

％Ｂ
「So we have guests coming in the afternoon today... You're aware, yes?」

Azuma
「...What are you talking about?」
I kinda guessed he might not have seen the mail...
Firm Staff A
「It's about Satou-san's case. People are coming to discuss photos to use for our presentation documents. Remember?」


Firm Staff B
「Didn't you personally ask Nishioka-san to do this, Chief?」
Azuma
「...Oh! That! No, I remember that, yeah. That's right, I asked Nishioka to do it.」

％Ｂ
「They're apparently coming first thing in the afternoon today.」
Azuma
「Sure, got it. Oh, speaking of, Nishioka hired a new assistant a few years back, didn't she?」

％Ｂ
「Uh...」
Firm Staff A
「I believe she did, now that you mention it.」
Azuma
「She was pretty cute. What was her name again?」

％Ｂ
「Well, uh...」
Firm Staff A
「I believe 
it was something like Hino Natsuki.
she had the same last name as him.
」
Azuma
「Hoh, the same last name as 
Hino
this guy
. What a coincidence. She a relative of yours or something?」

％Ｂ
「Um, please...」
They're definitely doing this on purpose...
all
Azuma-san's been friends with Nishioka-san, the photographer Natsuki works under, for a long time.

Azuma-san himself really likes Nishioka-san's photos, and they've worked together on projects before too.

Natsuki and Nishioka-san had already visited this firm several times by the time I started working here, so the staff here are familiar with them already.

Though she was still "Segawa" Natsuki back then, of course.
This'll be the first time she's here as ％Ａ Natsuki.
Azuma
「Do you know that assistant somehow?」
％Ｂ
「She... She would be... my wife...」
Azuma
「Hohoh, your wife! Hey, you hear that? That assistant of Nishioka's is apparently 

Hino's 
his 
wife. Man, now that's a surprise!」

％Ｂ
「Kh...」
And it's also going to be the first time Natsuki's come here since I started working.

I can understand why he's teasing me.
I can understand, but... 
What is he, a kid!?
all
Natsuki
「Hello! We're from the Nishioka Photo Studio!」
Nishioka
「Azuma-kun, we're heeere.」
Azuma
「Hey, welcome. Sorry for having you come all the way out here for this. And long time no see, Natsuki-chan.」


Natsuki
「Likewise, Azuma-san.」
Azuma
「Have a seat on that couch over there. I'll have our new hire bring us some coffee. Hey


, Hino

! Get us three cups of coffee!」
％Ｂ
「...Okay.」
all
Azuma
「What's wrong? You seem down. Nervous now that you've seen that cute little assistant, are you? Hm?」


％Ｂ
「You're just... No... I'll go get the coffee.」
Azuma
「Heheheh...」
Firm Staff A
「He's really getting it bad, isn't he?」
Firm Staff B
「He's pretty much Chief's toy at this point.」
all
Azuma
「So I want your help for the presentation photos for this property.」
...The mood shifts completely once the meeting actually begins.

Azuma
「I've put a decent amount of effort into this one. Normally I'd just want the photos of the completed building, but this time I wanna use your photos starting from the presentation phase.」


Nishioka
「Quite the honor to have my photos used for a presentation done by Azuma Morio himself.」


Azuma
「I should be the one saying that. I'm the one who gets to have Nishioka Youko take photos for my presentation. I bet it'll make for amazing material to present with.」


Nishioka
「Now don't blame me if your presentation fails, okay?」
Azuma
「No one would ever have complaints after seeing your photos.」

I've heard about Nishioka-san from Natsuki.
She normally just runs a photography store in town, but she's apparently very famous in the industry as a skilled photographer who's won lots of awards in contests.


Natsuki's ideology of taking pictures with everything she has is apparently significantly due to Nishioka-san's influence.

Which must be exactly why Natsuki decided to join Nishioka-san's studio as an assistant after graduating from vocational school.

Nishioka-san herself apparently knew about Natsuki's photography at that point, enough to approve of her working in her studio.

Nishioka
「I've brought my full architecture portfolio for now. It'd be helpful if you could tell me beforehand what kind of feel you're going for this time around. Natsuki, take out the photos we brought.」


Natsuki
「Yes, right away.」
Azuma
「And I'll need the documents from before too.」
％Ｂ
「Yes.」
Azuma-san's just as serious as ever when it comes to work.
He's like a completely different person from when he was teasing me about Natsuki.\n\r
I think Azuma-san's genuinely really cool in times like these.
I want to become an architect like him someday, and have meetings with a photographer about my own buildings in the same way.


And of course, that photographer... would have to be Natsuki.
Natsuki
「Here you go, Sensei.」
％Ｂ
「Here they are, Teacher.」
Nishioka
「...You make him call you Teacher?」
Azuma
「It wasn't my choice. He just decided to do this on his own.」

Nishioka
「You don't even act the part.」
Azuma
「Not like you're any better.」
Nishioka
「She calls me that in public, but I have her call me Youko-san normally.」

Azuma
「Excuse me!? Hey
, Hino

! Call me Morio-san from now on when we're in the firm!」

％Ｂ
「No... I couldn't possibly...」
all
The meeting between Nishioka-san and Azuma-san went on for a long time.
Natsuki and I both attended as their assistants, but...

Azuma
「This isn't good enough. I can't use it. This isn't the kinda photo I want.」

Their discussion's gradually grown more and more heated as time's gone on.

Azuma
「I want a photo that'll draw the client's interest and won't let go. It needs to be artistic, but also usable as proper material for the presentation.」


Nishioka
「That's not very specific. Could you make it easier for me to understand?」

Azuma
「For example, the back's too blurry in this one. It just looks like some amateur cameraman who just figured out how to work a camera's trying to show off what his camera can do function-wise.」


Azuma
「And this photo. There isn't enough light coming from inside the house. We're not trying to showcase a wake here. It's not showy enough, get what I'm saying?」

Azuma
「And I dunno how I feel about your focal point when you use wide-angle lenses. This isn't the part of the building I wanna show off! Can't you tell by just looking?」


％Ｂ
「U-Um... Teacher...」
Nishioka
「May I have a chance to defend myself? The blurring is to add a softer impression. The client for this building was a woman. She wouldn't have appreciated a masculine, hard-edged look.」


Nishioka
「And this one's a photo of a house in a peaceful residential area. Having lots of light just pouring out would make it look loud and obnoxious, wouldn't it? It's not supposed to look like a downtown storefront.」


Nishioka
「And this last one! The part you're trying to show off is obviously this part! You're the one who should take a closer look.」


Natsuki
「S-Sensei...」
What the heck's up with this scary situation?
Are their meetings always like this?
all
I look at Natsuki. She looks just as worried as I am.\n \n\r

Looks like it isn't normal for the two of them to get this heated.
all
Azuma
「I'm the expert when it comes to architecture.」
Nishioka
「And I'm the expert when it comes to photography.」
Not good! The meeting's going to go out the window if this gets any worse!
The other firm staff members are just silently watching...
Arghhh, then I'll...!
％Ｂ
「E-Excuse me! I apologize for overstepping my bounds, but if you could stop arguing...」


Natsuki
「H-He's right! This is supposed to be a discussion, so...」

Azuma
「What?」
Nishioka
「Huh...?」
Azuma-san and Nishioka-san look at each other, and then―
Azuma
「Pff... Kukuku...!」
Nishioka
「Hehe... Ahahahah...!」
％Ｂ
「H-Huh?」
Azuma
「Oh, come on. Did that really sound like we were arguing to you?」
Natsuki
「Um... You weren't?」
Nishioka
「We weren't. We'd never fight.」
％Ｂ
「B-But... that was clearly...」
Azuma
「Well, I'll admit that we did get a little heated.」
Nishioka
「But it isn't like we were saying all that because we hate each other.」
Azuma
「There are times when opinions clash when you're trying to make something good. If anything, these clashes are what give birth to good end products.」


Nishioka
「You could never take good pictures if you always compromised and gave up on what you wanted. It's the same thing as that.」


％Ｂ
「Uh huh...」
Natsuki
「This was a good learning experience...」
all
I get it... So that's why everyone else was just watching.
But then I...
Sigh... I still don't understand anything, do I...?
％Ｂ
「I'm home...」
Natsuki
「Sigh... I'm tired...」
We get home at pretty much around the same time.
We're both on the tired side from the meeting today.
％Ｂ
「Hey, what do you wanna do about food?」
Natsuki
「I don't really wanna cook at this point... Let's just get takeout or something tonight.」
％Ｂ
「Sounds good. What do you want?」
Natsuki
「Good question... Now that I think about it, I remember Sensei saying that new pizza place was good.」


％Ｂ
「Let's get that, then. What's the place called?」
Natsuki
「I think she said it's called Pizza Moon or something?」
％Ｂ
「Pizza Moon... One sec.」
all
I look it up on my phone.
％Ｂ
「Found it... Pizza Moon. It's small, but it's apparently a legitimate chain brand. It says their curry pizza's highly recommended.」


Natsuki
「Let's get that then. And fries and drinks too.」

％Ｂ
「Looks like you can order online. I'll handle it.」

all
％Ｂ
「Hamh... Mgmgh... Gulp... Oh... This is...」
Natsuki
「Amh... Mgmgh... Gulp... What the heck, this is amazing!」

％Ｂ
「I never would've thought curry pizza could work, but it's way better than I expected!」

Natsuki
「I like this pizzeria. Let's order from them a lot from now on.」

％Ｂ
「You're gonna get fat.」
Natsuki
「Gh... Th-Then... occasionally.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, that should be fine.」
Natsuki
「Still though, those two are amazing. I totally thought they were getting too emotional and that they started fighting.」


％Ｂ
「Same here.」
Natsuki
「Good things are born from the clashing of opinions... I really felt that one.」

％Ｂ
「Those were some pretty intense words. The kinda thing that professionals in the field say.」

Natsuki
「So I don't know much about architecture. What do you think about Azuma-san's work?」

％Ｂ
「In a nutshell, it's really cool. That really sums it up. It's a combination of functional aesthetics and good design, and he's got it completely calculated down to the way light shines in. It's just all really cool.」


Natsuki
「Hmm, I see.」
％Ｂ
「And what about you? What do you think about Nishioka-san's photography? She's impacted your photography a lot, right?」

Natsuki
「Not just a lot, it's a ton! The main thing about her photos is that she settles the focal point so it feels good just looking at them!」


Natsuki
「I guess you could say they aren't just photos for showing things, but to show them off? It just feels good looking at them!」


％Ｂ
「Really...」
Natsuki
「It's amazing that the two of them still aren't satisfied even though they're both that good.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah... It's like they're always direct when it comes to their work. They hit it head-on.」

Natsuki
「I wonder if we can become like that too?」
％Ｂ
「Good question... I wanna catch up, but I bet they're still gonna keep getting better too...」


Natsuki
「But don't you think that relationship where they push each other to be better and better's kinda nice?」

Natsuki
「I hope we can end up the same way. As husband and wife, and obviously also as an architect and a photographer.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, I hope so too.」
We're husband and wife, but... No. It's because we're husband and wife that I want to be like that with Natsuki.\n\r

It'd be great if we could...
Natsuki
「Like this curry pizza!」
％Ｂ
「...What's that supposed to mean?」
Natsuki
「'Cause it's a fusion of curry and pizza, where they both draw out each other's strong points and make each other more delicious, right? We should be like that too! We should be like this curry pizza!」


We should be like curry pizza...
I kinda get what she's trying to say, kinda don't...
