Touko
「Do you like it? We're having fried chicken today because I know you like it.」
％Ｂ
「...Uh. I made this.」
Touko
「I'm thinking we could have the bacon-wrapped asparagus I like tomorrow. What do you think?」

％Ｂ
「...So you want bacon-wrapped asparagus tomorrow. Got it.」
Touko
「And after dinner... What would you like? Wanna take a bath together?」
％Ｂ
「A-A bath!? What are you talking about!?」
Touko
「Geez, you're no fun. We're playing newlyweds.」
％Ｂ
「...You can't expect me to catch on that quickly.」
Touko
「You have to be able to play along with me at any time. You'll do your best, right?」

％Ｂ
「Play along... With what kinda stuff?」
Touko
「Hehe, things we can only do together. There are lots of things like that, aren't there...?」

％Ｂ
「...Is this a new way of messing with me?」
Touko
「Oh, figured it out? I guess that was a little too on the nose.」
％Ｂ
「You overacted it way too much. Of course I'm gonna figure it out if you aren't casual about it.」

I'm doing my best to appear completely unperturbed.
Though I'm completely excited and nervous on the inside.
Touko
「Okaaay. That's weeeird. Your heart's going crazy fast, but you're not falling for it at all?」

...So she knew.
Now I feel embarrassed for pretending to be calm!
Touko
「I'll have to do a little more research. Oh, doing something to shock you instead of just messing with you sounds fun too.」


％Ｂ
「...Please don't. I won't know what to believe when you say things.」

Touko
「But I really do want to play newlyweds, you know. It's something I've dreamed of too.」

That's a surprise. I didn't think she was interested in stuff like that.
It's nice getting to see a more normal, girly side of her.
Touko
「I thought you might play along for it. Well
, Ryousuke-kun

?」
Play along.
Don't play along.
Hmm... I haven't played pretend since I was a kid.
We may be alone right now, but pretending to be newlyweds... Isn't that going to be ridiculously embarrassing?

But I do want to play along with Touko.
Seeing her look at me like that makes me want to meet her expectations, even if it is going to be embarrassing.

％Ｂ
「...Okay. But just for a bit, 'cause we don't have much time.」
Touko
「Mhm, okay, okay. We'll have to be careful not to get too into it. Then, um... What should we do?」


％Ｂ
「How should I know?」
Touko
「It's not like newlyweds would do anything special together, right?」

％Ｂ
「Hmm... I dunno. I'm not really sure.」
Touko
「Now that I think about it, the things I think of are usually the dress or just how the word "newlyweds" sounds... I don't really know what newlyweds do exactly.」

The phrase evokes an image of "two people being cutesy together," but we already do that.\n\r

So then... what do you do when you pretend to be newlyweds?
Touko
「Mmm... I should've thought this through a little more. I only thought of trying to mess with you by playing newlyweds just a few minutes ago anyway.」


％Ｂ
「...Touko. You're giving your plan away. Could you not just state you were planning on messing with me?」


Touko
「...Eheh.」
She's smiling to try to distract me.
Dammit, she's so cute!
Touko
「Now dear, don't be so mad. It was just a passing fancy.」

...And now something weird's started up.
Is this the "playing newlyweds" Touko had in mind?
Since she's suddenly calling me "dear."
It makes me feel a bit itchy.
All right. It's embarrassing, but I'll play the part of the husband and...!
Touko
「Huh, that's not the reaction I was hoping for. I wanted you to be a little more flustered.」
％Ｂ
「Don't drop out of character already! I was mentally preparing myself to give a fitting response!」

Touko
「Oh, sorry, sorry. Take two, then.」
...Well, whatever.
It's already kinda different from playing pretend as a kid now that we've got takes.

Touko
「Dear, oh no... Don't be mad. I just wanted to play around a bit... Forgive me, please?」


It's a different line, and there's more feeling to it now.
...Where the heck does she wanna take this!?
％Ｂ
「I-I'm not mad. It's not like this is anything new, right?」

Touko
「Hehe... Thanks. You're so nice. But... that kindness of yours makes me worry.」

％Ｂ
「...I'm sorry?」
Touko
「Is it... really because of work that you're home late every day? Do you really think I don't know anything...?」

...Oh god, this is scary!
How am I supposed to respond to this when this is all made up!?
Touko gets her idea of a newlywed couple from afternoon television, doesn't she!?
％Ｂ
「D-Don't be ridiculous! I haven't done anything!」
Touko
「Ahaha, I'm kidding. It's just acting.」
％Ｂ
「...That acting makes my stomach hurt, so please don't.」
Touko
「I read in a magazine a long time ago that saying that gets men really freaked out.」

％Ｂ
「...What kinda magazines do you get stuff like that from?」
Touko
「It was a special in a fashion magazine. It had lots of other fun-sounding stuff too.」


Women's magazines now scare me.
The hell are they thinking, writing specials for stuff like that!?
Touko
「You're not the type to do anything like that, right
, Ryousuke-kun

? So it's fine.」

％Ｂ
「Of course I'm not. I wouldn't even have the time to do anything like that with how much we're together.」

Touko
「Oh, that's true. Now that I think about it, we're pretty much always together when we're not at home.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, 'cause I wanna be with you. So make take three something simple, please. About 20 percent sweeter, if you could.」


Touko
「...Ahaha, you're actually pretty into this.」
Yeah, but...
I have no idea what pretending to be newlyweds actually means, in terms of what we'd specifically do.

And thinking it over, it sounds crazy embarrassing.
I can only imagine something ridiculously sugary sweet.
％Ｂ
「...Sorry, but I'm gonna pass.」
Touko
「Whaaat～!? You won't do it with me～!?」
％Ｂ
「But come on! What do you even want to do specifically?」

Touko
「Mmm... Well let's see, the way I imagined it...」
...Uh. She's frozen up.
Touko
「...I'm not really sure.」
％Ｂ
「What? You're the one who said we should do it.」
Touko
「But I only just thought of it. I thought it'd be nice if we could just get the mood right.」

％Ｂ
「I dunno if we could do that here. We're both wearing our uniforms, so we don't look anything like newlyweds.」

Touko
「Mhhh... That's where I want you to cooperate. Do you have any good ideas?」

You expect me to have ideas?
Wouldn't it be weird if a guy could just come up with ideas for pretending to be newlyweds off the top of his head?

％Ｂ
「Figure out a more concrete idea and tell me what it is. Then I'll decide if I wanna play along.」

Touko
「Whaaat? ...You're so cold. Are we in a rut?」
％Ｂ
「Wha, no, of course not!」
Touko
「Ahaha, there you go, you're freaking out. This is the kinda reaction I wanted to see.」

...Crap. I fell for it.
Hook, line, and sinker...
Touko
「It's fun teasing you. I wonder what I should do to mess with you next.」

％Ｂ
「...Please don't plan out stuff like that right in front of the intended victim.」
Touko
「But you'd be sad if I stopped doing things like that, right?」

I try imagining it.
...It wouldn't be like her at all.
Touko
「We can try playing newlyweds some other time. I'll think about it more, so wait, okay?」

Shuuichi's apparently participating in some kind of meeting for heads of the clubs and committees today.\n\r

We ran out of things to do a little before it's time to go home.
％Ｂ
「What do you wanna do? We could go to the old school building... Or do you wanna go home?」

Touko
「Mmm... What should we do? Fuaaah...gh, I'm a bit sleepy because I didn't take a nap today.」

％Ｂ
「Then let's relax in the old school building until... Wait, that's Ousaka... Up on the roof.」

Touko
「Maybe she's looking at the stars. I guess you can still see them even though it's light out?」

％Ｂ
「We've got some time, so let's go see what she's doing.」
$$smh_OpenCHK
％Ｂ
「Yo, Ousaka. We saw you from down below.」
Touko
「Ahh... It's nice and cool up here. The wind feels good, and the view's nice too. This seems like a great spot for a nap.」


Sora
「You'd probably catch a cold. I don't have a sleeping bag or blanket today.」
％Ｂ
「Don't worry, we're not actually gonna sleep up here.」

Touko
「Oh, you're not? I was pretty serious about it. It's summer, so I think a little bit would be fine.」

Sora
「You'll hurt when you wake up. At least use this.」
％Ｂ
「N-No, it's fine! Thanks for being so considerate though, Ousaka!」
I frantically stop her as she begins to take off her hoodie.
The carefree Touko and straightforward Ousaka make for a strangely perfect combination.

all
％Ｂ
「Anyway, can you see the stars well today?」
Sora
「...Want to see?」
all
She pulls away from the telescope.
I immediately peer in. There's a glimmering point visible through the lens.
％Ｂ
「What star's this?」
Sora
「Spica. The brightest fixed star in Virgo. One of the corners of the Spring Triangle. It's a variable star, with a distinctive blue-white color.」

％Ｂ
「Oh yeah, you mentioned this one over LIME that one time. What's a variable star?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, I think I've heard about Spica. Huh... so this is what it looks like. What's a variable star?」

Sora
「Its brightness periodically changes. It doesn't change enough to be visible while watching, but the brightness changes systematically and gradually every four days.」


％Ｂ
「Didn't know stars like that existed. Though... it looks really bright through this telescope.」

Sora
「Spica is much brighter and hotter than the Sun. It's one thousand times brighter than the Sun, and its surface temperature is approximately 20,000 degrees.」

％Ｂ
「What!? So then if the Sun disappears, we can just rely on this guy next?」

Sora
「...Not that easy. Stars only exist because of an accumulation of miracles. You can't move them.」

all
％Ｂ
「Touko, you wanna see too? It's super pretty.」
Touko
「Oh, okay. Um... Can I?」

Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「Can you see it?」
Touko
「...Mhm, I can. It's blue-white... It's a really pretty star.」
Sora
「There should be an orange one a bit to the north. Can you see it?」
Touko
「...Oh, this one? This one's really bright too. Wow, so the colors can be this different?」

Sora
「Arcturus. The brightest fixed star in Boötes. Another corner of the Spring Triangle.」

Sora
「Tou is Spica, and 
Ryou is 
you're 
Arcturus.」
Ousaka told me about these two stars a while ago.
What'd she say again...?
...What's that mean?
Touko's Spica, and I'm Arcturus...?
Sora
「Arcturus and Spica are called the Married Stars. Perfect for you two.」

Touko
「Hgh!? Wh-What are you talking about!?」
Sora
「...? Am I wrong?」
％Ｂ
「Uh, well, uh...!」
Touko
「Geez... You say some pretty crazy things, Fluffyhead... You see, we're...」

Sora
「Mm, what?」
Touko
「...Tagging you in. You take care of the rest.」
％Ｂ
「What!? What am I supposed to...!?」
Sora
「Arcturus is a variable star too. The two stars will be as close as they'll ever be in about 50,000 years. Try to live long.」

％Ｂ
「...That's impossible.」
Sora
「...And if you tie them together with Denebola in Leo, it's the Spring Triangle.」
We draw lines between the stars as we listen to Ousaka's explanation.
It's strange how I can suddenly feel really familiar with the stars after learning just a bit about them.

Sora
「I actually want you to see them when it's darker. Spica and Arcturus are like jewels when it's night. Really pretty.」

％Ｂ
「I pretty much know where they are now, so I'll try tonight. Can I see them without a telescope or anything?」

Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「This stuff only gets more interesting the more you learn. There's just so much to it, you know?」
Sora
「It makes me happy to hear that. I like talking about it too.」
％Ｂ
「Haha, really. I like listening to you talk too. It's so interesting.」
Sora
「...You'll make me blush. Want to see more?」
％Ｂ
「No, I wouldn't wanna get in your way for too long. I'll come again sometime, and we can take our time then.」

Sora
「...Come anytime.」
Touko
「I never knew. You're interested in stars?」
％Ｂ
「No, it's more like... Don't you think it's fun to listen to Ousaka talk? I really appreciate how much she knows.」

Touko
「I think it's amazing too. I wonder how Fluffyhead got interested in stars?」

％Ｂ
「Well... Guess you'd have to ask Ousaka to find out. But if I had to guess, it's probably that she liked to look at them, or she liked to read stories about them or something.」


Touko
「...I wonder if it's the same for Camera-chan and Piano-chan. And Jellyfish-senpai.」

％Ｂ
「I bet everyone's got something that got them started. It's not like I just suddenly got interested in architecture out of nowhere either.」

Touko
「Really... I guess you're all enjoying the springtime of your youths. It sure looks fun.」
％Ｂ
「We're doing that too, aren't we? See?」
I take her hand and pull our linked hands up before our eyes.
It's a bit... no, it's really embarrassing.
Touko
「...You're right. Yeah, this is that too.」
She squeezes back gently and smiles.
Being a bit embarrassed is nothing if I get to see this smile.

Touko
「I wonder... if we'll be able to see the stars on the way home.」
％Ｂ
「Probably not until it gets a little darker out... Wanna stop by somewhere on the way?」

Touko
「Mmm... Why don't we have some fun here? I feel like we wouldn't have much time if we went downtown now.」

％Ｂ
「That's true. Let's do that. But what are we gonna do?」
Touko
「Just wander around. Let's explore, let's explore～♪」
％Ｂ
「Agh, hey, Touko! Wait... Don't pull!」
all
Touko and I have a bit of fun in secret after school.
It's a comfortable, exciting... and fun time.
