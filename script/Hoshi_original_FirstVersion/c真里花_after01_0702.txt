Bus Driver
『Next stop, Heiwadai and 1st Street. Heiwadai and 1st Street is coming up.』
％Ｂ
「...Nh... Fuaaaahhh... afh.」
Bus Driver
『If you are getting off here, please press a nearby button...』
％Ｂ
「...Heiwadai and 1st?」
Huh? I'm pretty sure...
I'm supposed to be getting off at...
％Ｂ
（Ack! ...Did we pass it already!?）
Bus Driver
「This is Heiwadai and 1st. Would anyone like to get off here?」
％Ｂ
「Uh, uhh...」
I frantically page through my notebook.
We're meeting up at...
％Ｂ
（Phew... Safe. It's Heiwadai and 5th...）

I sigh in relief once I check where I need to go.
Now that I think about it, I remember I set my phone to vibrate to wake me up once I got close to the bus stop, so I wouldn't sleep through it.


Bus Driver
「We will pass this stop, then. The next stop is Heiwadai and 3rd Street...」

It may have only been a minor setback to miss my stop back when I was a student...
But now that I'm a fully fledged member of society, I can't allow myself to be late.
I may be sleep deprived, but I need to get it together.
％Ｂ
「Phew...」
I've managed to get to the meet-up spot ten minutes early, as planned.
I sip at a cup of coffee to wake myself up while I wait for the other party.

％Ｂ
「Oh...」
It's a call.
That must be Oono-san.
％Ｂ
「Hello, this is ％Ａ, from the Azuma Morio Architectural Firm. Thank you very much for calling.」

I step outside and take the call.
Oono
『Oh! Yes, hello, this is Oono. I'm very sorry, I'm currently en route, but there's some traffic...』

％Ｂ
「Oh no, no worries. It is rush hour right now, after all. I'll be awaiting your arrival.」


He's apparently going to be about thirty minutes or so late.
I'll treat this as study time, then.
I need to make up for the time I lost sleeping on the bus earlier.
I open the page I bookmarked in my textbook.
％Ｂ
「By architectural basics, which of the following are not to be considered when deciding what to include when calculating design budget... This is for a new project construction... so...」


Oono
「I apologize for being so late. And after asking you to come all the way out here, too...」

Oono-san arrives, wiping the sweat from his brow, after I've been studying for a while.

％Ｂ
「Oh no, it's no problem at all. I was taking the opportunity to do some studying.」

Oono
「Hoh, is that an architect's reference book there? My, studying on top of work? Sounds like you're quite busy.」

％Ｂ
「Hahaha... Yes, I guess I am. I think I may be studying now more than I've ever studied throughout my life.」

I place my bookmark in the book to mark my spot.
Oono
「That's a unique-looking bookmark.」
％Ｂ
「Yes, it was a gift. It's a bookmark that makes my wishes come true.」

I place the reference book in my bag.
I take out the materials for work.
Oono-san orders coffee too, and the two of us sit across from each other at a table.
％Ｂ
「Now then, about what you wished to speak with me directly about today...」

Oono
「Yes, about that... It would be about the house for us that we're having Azuma-san work on...」


Oono-san's the client for the private residence design case that I'm currently in charge of.

We usually meet to talk at the office, but today he said he wanted to meet at this restaurant for some reason.\n\r

I more or less understand why.
Oono
「Well, as for me, I'm a huge fan of Azuma-san, so I believe he's designed a wonderful house... but, well, my wife, you see...」


％Ｂ
「She disapproves?」
Oono
「Well, yes. In a nutshell, yes.」
％Ｂ
「I see...」
I had kind of sensed it already, but now I know for sure.
So that's why he wanted to talk without Azuma-san around.
This isn't anything rare.
If it's someone as famous as Azuma-san, there are times when even the client finds it difficult to speak their mind.

Especially when they're sandwiched between us and their family.
That's when they send beginners like me out.
...Though this is my third year working at the firm.
％Ｂ
「Could I hear about the specifics?」
Oono
「It seems she just can't accept the overall shift in the floor plan... I understand that's the main point of this plan...」

％Ｂ
「Yes, it may seem strange at first glance. But it's actually a very logical design.」

％Ｂ
「If one takes the surroundings and floor space into account, this slight shifting of the floor plan will be best for letting in light from outside...」

Oono
「Oh no, I understand. I do. But she thinks it may be hard to position furniture, or it may make moving through the house inconvenient...」


％Ｂ
「We've prepared plenty of space for storage. I'll explain it with the blueprint. Here, and here, and...」

Oono
「I tried explaining it to her that way, but she still didn't understand. It just seems that we ordinary folk can't understand the greatness of the designs of someone as well reputed as Azuma-san...」


％Ｂ
「That shouldn't be the case at all...」
Oono
「Do you think you could tell Azuma-san about this, as tactfully as possible?」

％Ｂ
「Well... Okay. I'll see what I can do.」

I'm sure that they'd realize how ergonomic and nice-looking it is once it's built...

But it's hard to get that across through blueprints.
What can we do to get them to understand?
Azuma
「It's your job to get the client to understand, isn't it?」

And that's what I'm told once I get back and discuss it with him.
Azuma
「It looks like Oono-san's wife just doesn't have a clear image of what the intent of the design is.」

％Ｂ
「I tried doing what I could to explain...」
Azuma
「Explaining it doesn't guarantee they'll understand.」

Azuma
「It'd be one thing if they understood everything but still wanted to change the plan, but we're not at that stage yet.」


all
He returns his gaze to his computer, as if to say that were the end of the conversation.
So I guess he's saying it's still too early to bring it to his attention...
I'll have to put some more thought into this on my own...
Firm Staff A
「Hey, Hino. You're here pretty late today.」
Firm Staff A
「Hey. You're here pretty late today.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, sorry. I just wanted to wrap this up...」

Firm Staff A
「Yeah, that Oono-san's got a scary wife. I get what you're going through.」

Firm Staff A
「I'm sure you've got a lot to complain about. How about we go get a drink together after work?」

％Ｂ
「Oh, I'm sorry... I'm grateful for the offer, but I'll have to decline. My exams are soon.」

Firm Staff A
「Oh, that's right. Right, you're going to be taking your first-class exam...」

That's right. I'm going to be taking my exams to become a first-class architect.
To take the exam, one has to work at a firm for two years after graduating from university in an architectural major...

So now that I've started my third year, I'm finally allowed to take it.
That's why as soon as I'm done with work, I go straight home and face my desk.

I've barely shown my face at drinking parties for the past half year.
The other firm workers seem to understand what I'm going through, and try not to invite me out.

Firm Staff B
「It's still your first try, right? You should just take it for the experience, then.」


Firm Staff A
「That's right. It's hard to become a first-class. It's gotten especially hard recently... Maybe you should relax and take a more long-term view of it?」


％Ｂ
「No, I'd like to aim to pass it on my first try. It's what I've been trying so hard for until now.」

Firm Staff A
「Oh, well said.」
Firm Staff A
「When I was your age, I thought of it as something further down the road.」

％Ｂ
「I have a reason to become a first-class architect as quickly as possible.」

Firm Staff A
「Hoooh... And what's that?」
％Ｂ
「Well of course, it's to become a fully fledged architect as soon as I can, so I can be of use to the firm...」
Azuma
「It's a woman.」
％Ｂ
「...!!」
Firm Staff B
「Oh, you definitely freaked out just now.」
He's got the answer completely right.
％Ｂ
「U-Uhh... Chief! About the Oono residence, I think it'd be best for us to get in contact with his wife, and discuss things with the entire family.」


Firm Staff A
「He brought up work to try to shake off the conversation...」
all
％Ｂ
「Okay! Now that that's been decided, I'll send them mail today!」

I turn toward my computer and tap away at the keyboard.
Focus, focus!
On work and on studying!
The first-class exam's split into two parts.
First, I have to take the subject exam, which is in July. This month.

If I don't pass that, then I won't be able to take the drafting exam in October.
I've gotten a good deal of experience with drafting, so I'm decently confident about that part.
The first hurdle's gonna be the subject exam.
Most of the applicants actually fail at that step.
％Ｂ
「Let's see... According to architectural basics, which of the following actions related to city zoning does not require a certificate of authentication...」

％Ｂ
「I'm pretty sure it's...」
％Ｂ
「...」
％Ｂ
「...Gasp!? Crap. I fell asleep.」

I guess I studied until dawn yesterday too.
I got a few hours of sleep, went to work, then got home and studied until late... Of course I'm tired.

But it's just for a little longer.
That's right. Once I get that qualification... I'll...
％Ｂ
「...I'm gonna do my best.」
I gently pat my bookmark.
I turn back toward my textbook.
％Ｂ
「I'm gonna pass on the first try. I swear.」
I don't have work tomorrow.
I'm gonna focus and work hard until morning!
