Marika
「Excuse meee...」
％Ｂ
「Zzz... Zzz...」
Marika
「Oh, he fell asleep while he was studying again～ It might be summer, but I think you'll catch a cold if you don't sleep in bed...」


Marika
「Let's see... The linens are...」
％Ｂ
「Nnnh...」
Marika
「Oh...」
I hear some sounds.
And a gentle voice.
This has to be...
％Ｂ
「...Marika...」
I blearily open my eyes.
Marika
「Hehe... Good morning.」
％Ｂ
「Y-Yeah... Good morning... Marika.」
It's the same smile as ever.
It's my beloved girlfriend that I've been dating since high school.
％Ｂ
「You came over?」
Marika
「Yeah, just now. I tried to contact you, but you didn't respond... so I just assumed you were asleep.」


all
％Ｂ
「Oh, you did...」
I check my phone.
There's a few LIME messages from her.
％Ｂ
「Ughh. My body hurts...」
Marika
「That's because you slept like that. I think it'd be more restful if you slept in your sheets like normal.」

％Ｂ
「I know that, but... I just kinda fell asleep while I was moving from problem to problem.」


Marika
「I get that you're trying hard, but don't ruin your body, okay?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, I'll be careful.」
Marika
「Sigh～ Geez. This makes me wish I could always be with you.」

％Ｂ
「That'd make me happy... but it's not like we can do that, right?」

Marika
「Mhm... Yeah.」
I doubt Marika's dad would allow us to live together.
The two of us implicitly understand that.
％Ｂ
「I'll have to straighten up a little more. And for that...」

I gently place my hand on my open textbook.
Marika
「Oh...」
Marika notices the bookmark on the page.

Marika
「Isn't that...」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. It's the tanzaku you wrote for me before. I figured I'd use it as a good luck charm.」

Marika
「You're using it～ ...Thanks.」
I carefully pick up the bookmark.
It's a tanzaku.
Marika's handwriting is on it.
"I wish for ％Ｂ to pass his first-class architect exams."
％Ｂ
「But... it'll be up to me whether or not I'll be able to make this come true.」
Just like how Marika was able to conquer her asthma.
This time... it's my turn to do my best, so Marika and I can be together.
Marika
「Mhm... I'm so happy you're trying that hard. You're so dependable.」

Marika
「That's why I want to support you, Ryousuke.」
Marika
「That's why I want to support you.」
％Ｂ
「Support me... well...」
Marika
「I know! I have a suggestion～」
％Ｂ
「Oh? What is it?」
Marika
「I was thinking... I could take care of you all day today～」
％Ｂ
「Take... care of me?」
Marika
「Yep! I think that's the kind of support I can give now.」
Marika
「Now then... allow me to ask you.」
％Ｂ
「Y-Yeah.」
Marika
「About how much actual sleep did you get last night?」
％Ｂ
「Huh? Oh, uhh... about four hours...? I remember I was up at least past five o'clock...」

Marika
「I don't think that's good for your health...」
Marika
「Maybe it'll clear your head if you slept just a bit right now?」

Marika
「You know, just thirty minutes or an hour. Kind of like a nap.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah... You might be right.」
My mind's been kinda foggy.
I don't think I'll be able to focus on studying at all this way.
％Ｂ
「But I wonder if I'll be able to sleep. I'm kinda worked up... I can't help but get nervous when I think about how I should be studying.」


Marika
「Yeah, I get how you feel～ But maybe... you could try lying down in bed, just for a bit?」

％Ｂ
「S-Sure...」
all
I do as Marika suggests and lie down in my bed.
Now that I think about it, I don't think I've lain down in my sheets in a while...

Marika
「Very good. Yes... you're a good boy.」
Marika sits on my bed to stay by my side.
She whispers gently to me and strokes my hair.
I feel like a weight's lifted from deep inside my heart.
％Ｂ
「Oh man... This is comfy...」
Marika
「I'm really good at getting kids to sleep.」
Marika
「They say I'm really helpful to have around when it's nap time... The older teachers praise me lots, you know.」

％Ｂ
「Oh really... Yeah, I bet...」
After we graduated, Marika entered the education department at the same university as me, and then became a preschool teacher.

She's currently working at a local preschool.
Marika
「Here, I'll be right next to you. There's nothing to worry about...」

She keeps stroking my hair.
A soothing relaxation flows into me.
％Ｂ
「This soothing ability... You could probably achieve world peace with this...」
Marika
「Ahahaha... I think you're exaggerating～」
％Ｂ
「Aaahhh, I think I might be able to sleep with just a bit more...」
Marika
「Just a little more～ Then, I don't do this at the preschool... This is just for you, Ryousuke.」

Marika
「Just a little more～ Then, I don't do this at the preschool... This is just for you.」

％Ｂ
「Huh?」
She lies down on the bed.
Marika
「Squeeeeze...」
She presses her body against mine.
％Ｂ
「...Oh...」
Marika's body is small.
She's really dainty. Her arms are thin enough that I'm worried they could break.
But... it just feels like I'm being neatly enveloped by her.

％Ｂ
「I didn't take a bath last night. I don't stink, do I...?」

Marika
「Whaaat? I don't think you stink at all.」
Marika
「But... I can smell you lots, Ryousuke.」
Marika
「But... I can smell you lots.」
She presses her cheek tightly against mine.
％Ｂ
「I'm sleepy...」
Marika
「That's okay. Good night...」

And I do as those whispers say...
And let my consciousness fall into the world of dreams.
...
......
.........
％Ｂ
「Nh, mh... fuaah...」
％Ｂ
「I feel like I slept a ton...」
I wake up feeling pretty refreshed.
The leaden fatigue from earlier's completely gone.
I look at the clock. It looks like I slept just about an hour and a half.
Marika
「Oh, good morning～ ...I was just thinking that I should wake you up soon.」


％Ｂ
「Yeah, morning... Wait... H-Huh?」

Marika
「What's wrong?」
％Ｂ
「Is it just me? ...I feel like my room's sparkling...」
Marika
「Huh? Y-You think so...? I did clean it a bit, but...」

％Ｂ
「What? You did?」
Marika
「Yeah. Quietly, so I wouldn't wake you up. The vacuum would've been loud, so I just used a dustcloth.」

Her hand's a bit red.
It has to be from wringing out the cloth.
Marika
「You've been busy with work and studying lately, so I'm sure you haven't been able to do much housework.」

Marika
「So I was just thinking it'd be nice if I could help out even just a bit. Oh, I cleaned up the bathroom and kitchen too.」


Marika
「And... I brought breakfast from my house too, so let's eat it together. It's sandwiches, with plenty of vegetables.」


％Ｂ
「Marika...」
Marika
「W-Wah...!」
I hug her tight.
％Ｂ
「You're a wonderful woman...」
Marika
「Th-That's not true～ W-Wah... I got sweaty from cleaning, so I might smell a little...」

％Ｂ
「You smell really nice. It's your smell, Marika.」
Marika
「Ahaha～ ...Mhm, then... Smell me lots, okay?」

She smiles in embarrassment and gently strokes my hair.
What little sleepiness I had left's all gone now.
％Ｂ
「Okay! I'm gonna go take a shower!」
Marika
「Have fun～! Oh, here's a towel and a change of clothes.」

％Ｂ
「Ohh, thanks!」
Marika
「I'll make coffee for you in the meantime～」
％Ｂ
「Phew...」
I'm feeling refreshed after a shower.
Breakfast's been laid out on the desk.
Marika
「Sorry it's so simple.」
％Ｂ
「What are you talking about? This is just plain luxurious. Let's eat... Oohhh! This is great!」

％Ｂ
「What is this? It's got a bit of a kick to it.」
Marika
「That's spicy mayo. I thought you'd like it. I'm glad you did～」

％Ｂ
「It tastes amazing. Mgmg...」
Marika
「Wah, so fast...」
Now that I think about it, I haven't eaten since yesterday evening.
all
I finish the sandwiches in no time. I sit back and relax, drinking coffee.

％Ｂ
「Phew... I'm done...」
Marika
「I'm glad you liked it so much～ I'll make it again.」

all
She then swiftly cleans up the dishes.
I'm really grateful for everything she's doing.
But...
％Ｂ
「Sorry it's been this way lately. I bet you wanna go out somewhere since it's the weekend.」

Marika
「Whaaat? I don't care about that at all... We can do that after you pass your exams. We can take our time then.」


％Ｂ
「Ahaha, okay. I promise.」
Marika
「Mhm, I'm looking forward to it♪」
She smiles.
This smile's what gets me to do my best.
％Ｂ
「All right. I'm gonna get back to studying now.」
Marika
「Oh, I won't bother you... but can I stay here? I was thinking I could do some work next to you...」

％Ｂ
「Work? For the preschool?」
Marika
「Yeah. There's a parents' night soon, so I wanted to prepare...」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, of course. You can work right next to me.」

all
And so, Marika and I start working and studying respectively after eating.

％Ｂ
「By the way... What are you doing for parents' night?」
I ask her casually as I look at my notebook.
Marika
「It's going to be a play. We're going to do Alice in Wonderland.」

％Ｂ
「Huh... Alice, I see... Alice... Her big adventure with Tinkerbell, eh...」

Marika
「Ahaha. You've never read it, have you?」
％Ｂ
「You got me. But I do like John Tenniel's illustrations.」

Marika
「Is he the one who drew those pictures? That's his name?」
％Ｂ
「There's still a lot of people out there who are fans of Alice's world. We've had clients who wanted their interiors "in the style of Alice in Wonderland."」


Marika
「I see～ I didn't know things like that happen.」
She pulls a large bag toward her as she talks.
She pulls out a fluttery, Alice-esque outfit.
％Ｂ
「Is that a costume for the play?」
Marika
「No, I bought this as something to look off of. I thought it'd be nice to see the real thing, since the kids have to make costumes.」


Marika
「I'm going to see how it's put together, and make the pattern paper that way. The moms are going to be the ones actually making the costumes, but I still need to make materials for them to look off of.」


％Ｂ
「I see... That seems like a lot of work...」
The Alice-style clothes look really cutesy.
I'm sure the kids would look good in something like that.
And more importantly...
％Ｂ
「I think... you'd look good in something like that too.」
Marika
「Huh? Y-You think so～? I don't know if something this fluttery would look good on me～」

％Ｂ
「It definitely would. Why don't you try it on later? I bet it'll be cute.」


Marika
「Y-You think so～? ...I don't know～」
Marika
「But if you're really sure... then maybe I could try wearing it a bit?」

％Ｂ
「Ohh, seriously? Then once we get to a good stopping point with our work...」

Marika
「Yeah, once we're done with our work today... Okay?」
％Ｂ
「All right!」
Marika
「Ahaha, you don't need to be that happy～」
％Ｂ
「No, this is great motivation. All right, I'm gonna plow right through these questions!」

all
My focus heightens!
c真里花_9006エッチシーン6
Marika
「Thanks for walking me.」
％Ｂ
「No problem. It's pretty late, after all. And I need to at least get a bit of exercise in... It's not healthy staying inside the house all day.」


Marika
「Ahaha, that's true～」
Marika's house isn't that far from my apartment.
The two of us slowly make our way through a route that should only take us about ten or fifteen minutes.
This is pretty much habit for us now.
Marika
「Oh, I made dinner for you too. It's in the fridge, so just warm it up in the microwave.」

％Ｂ
「Sorry I made you do so much.」
Marika
「No, it's okay. There's enough for a midnight snack too, so good luck with studying. And with work on Monday.」


％Ｂ
「Yeah, I'll do my best. Thanks.」
％Ｂ
「I'm focusing on studying for the weekend, but I'll need to think about that property I'm in charge of too.」

Marika
「Oh yeah, you were saying that your client asked you to change plans, right?」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, he did. His wife's apparently against the current ones. I've gotta do something about it now that I'm in charge...」


Marika
「That seems hard. It's not like you can imagine what a house will be like until it's built... and there's especially a lot of women who can't be convinced until they see it for themselves.」


Marika
「I'm sure she'd understand right away if she could actually compare the two.」

％Ｂ
「Actually compare them...」
all
She has a point. That's probably the best option.
But we can only build one house.
But, well...
％Ｂ
「Hmm...」
Marika
「Oh, this far is fine～」
Eventually, Marika's house comes into view while I'm thinking.
％Ｂ
「All right. Good luck on your preparations too.」
Marika
「Yeah, I'm going to do my best! Ahaha... We're a really motivated couple, aren't we...」

％Ｂ
「Seriously.」
all
We smile at each other, reluctantly part ways, and I start on my way home.
