Rikka
「Are you ready yet? We'll be late if we don't leave soon.」
She's not talking about being late for work.
％Ｂ
「I know, but... Uhh, this is how you use this thing, right? ...I probably should've read the manual more carefully...」
Rikka
「...Just when did you buy such an expensive-looking camera? If you don't know how to use it, then just save it for next time. Your phone camera's fine, isn't it?」
％Ｂ
「No, you gotta get stuff like this with a proper camera. And I didn't buy this, I borrowed it from Segawa.」
Rikka
「When did you... Oh, so that's why she seemed so amused when I saw her the other day...」
％Ｂ
「She wanted photos of you in your dress as payment.」
That's right... Rikka and I are going to go get her wedding dress fitted today.
We've saved up enough to hold a small ceremony, and things have settled down a bit for work, so we're going to be holding our wedding in June this year.
Rikka
「I'm not going to be a dress-up doll today.」
％Ｂ
「Whaaat.」
Rikka
「How many were you planning on making me try on?」
％Ｂ
「Maybe like twenty, at least?」
Rikka
「Why would you even make me wear that many... We'd be a bother to the people there... and it would be exhausting for me too.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, you're right... I thought I was gonna get to take lots of pretty photos of you...」
Rikka
「Don't get so depressed. I'm happy that you want to see me like that so much. Let's find a dress that looks good on me together, okay? You can take as many photos of that one as you want.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah! Let's find you the perfect dress!」
Rikka
「Hehe, you seem even happier about this than I am. You haven't forgotten that you're getting fitted too, have you?」
％Ｂ
「I remember. But men don't have as much variety as women, you know? All that matters is that the suit pretty much fits.」

Rikka
「Mmhhh... No. This is the only wedding ceremony we'll ever have. I want my groom to look as good as he possibly can.」
％Ｂ
「Well, if you say so.」
Rikka
「Hehehe, I'll pick out a tuxedo that's perfect for you. Because I know you better than anyone.」
Rikka
「But I'd like to see you in lots of cool suits, so I think I'll have you wear about twenty at least. I hope you're prepared.」
％Ｂ
「Getting revenge on me, are you...」
Rikka
「Hehe. I think knowing that I'm going to get to hold a wedding ceremony with you soon has gotten me in a good mood.」
％Ｂ
「Weddings are pretty special for girls, right?」
Like how every girl wants to wear a wedding dress at least once when she's married.
Rikka
「I think it's more that having everyone celebrate you being married to the person you love is special than holding the wedding itself.」

Rikka
「I want everyone who's important to me to see the moment where I show off just how happy I am.」
％Ｂ
「Speaking of which, we should get started on the invitations too.」
Rikka
「You're right. Let's write them out once we get home.」
