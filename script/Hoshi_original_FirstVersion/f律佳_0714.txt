Beep beep beep... Beep beep beep...
$$smh_OpenCHK
I stop my alarm.
I look at the time. It's an hour earlier than I usually get up.
％Ｂ
「Nnnnghhh... Fuaah, afh.」
But I'm not tired at all. I get up and stretch.
I open the window and look outside. The clear air and gentle light of morning greet me.
％Ｂ
「I didn't know morning could feel this good.」
This is something new.
Usually when I wake up, the sunlight's already swelled to summer heat, and the cicadas are making a racket in the trees.

％Ｂ
「Whoops, shouldn't just stand here.」
There'd be no point in waking up early if I end up being late to go pick her up.
I head toward the bathroom to wash up.
I do one last look-over of the house and lock the front door.
I have more than enough time to walk all the way to Rikka's place.
I wonder why I'm getting so excited about picking up my girlfriend.

My body feels so alive.
I think going to school's going to be a lot of fun from now on.\n\r
Plus, she and I connected physically for the first time yesterday.
Just remembering it tickles my heart.
I hope Rikka feels the same way.
Rikka
「Good morning.」
％Ｂ
「Morning.」
She smiles as she greets me.
It's the same morning exchange as always, but something feels different from before.

It's kinda... ticklish.
It's like my heart's grinning.
％Ｂ
「You ready to go?」
Rikka
「Mhm. I've finished preparing.」
Rikka walks over to a chair and table and grabs her schoolbag... and a cute-looking bag.
％Ｂ
「I'll hold that. You made lunch, right?」
Rikka
「Thank you.」
I place my hand on the bottom of the bag as I take it from her, so I don't drop it. It's still slightly warm.

％Ｂ
「Did you just put rice in this or something?」
Rikka
「Because it would get hard if I put it in yesterday.」
％Ｂ
「A freshly made lunch. Now I wanna eat it right away.」
Rikka
「Hehe. You'll have to wait until lunch.」
all
The two of us walk to the front door.
I put on my shoes, but Rikka stops still.
％Ｂ
「What's wrong? Forget something?」
Rikka
「...Yes. You've forgotten something.」
％Ｂ
「Huh? ...Me?」
What'd I forget?
Rikka
「Haven't you forgotten something?」
％Ｂ
「Nothing really comes to mind...」
I don't have my gym clothes, but I don't have gym today.
Rikka hasn't looked inside my bag, so it's not like she'd know what's inside anyway...

％Ｂ
「...Ah.」
I get it now.
That was a bit dumb of me.
I hold Rikka by the shoulders and pull her closer.
％Ｂ
「Rikka. I'm off...」
Rikka
「Mm, chu... Chu, fh... Have a good day.」
Rikka
「Hehehe, I'll be going too... Mmm～ Chu.」
And only then do the two of us hold hands and leave the house.
all
It's finally lunch break.
Lunchtime with Rikka.
Natsuki
「Thinking sure makes me hungry. I'm starving.」
％Ｂ
「...And why might you be here, Segawa-san?」
Natsuki
「I already told you. I wanted to eat with you guys.」
％Ｂ
「I think a true friend would be considerate of things like this. Don't you?」
Natsuki
「Ah, don't worry. I'm only going to take photos of Rikka's lunch. I won't steal any of it. Photos, nothing more.」

Natsuki
「More importantly, hurry up and show me it～ \nThe・lunch・your・wife・made♪」
Rikka
「W-Wife... Uuuh...」
％Ｂ
「You better really only take photos, all right?」
Natsuki
「Yeah, of course.」
I undo the neatly tied cloth place mat and open the lid.
Natsuki
「Oooh～ ...It looks really pretty. Lots of different vegetables, too. Looks like a lot of thought went into nutrition～」

Rikka
「He likes strong-tasting things, but I try to tone down the sodium.」

Rikka
「It's easy to take in too much of it if you're not thinking about it. And nothing's good for your body if you take in too much.」

％Ｂ
「What? Really? I don't think I've ever thought your food wasn't strong enough, though.」

Rikka
「You can get the flavor to come out fine if you use little tricks like purposefully reducing the amount of moisture.」

Natsuki
「You've got a good wife～」
Segawa's been taking photos this entire time.
Natsuki
「Rikka's got you in her grasp now.」
％Ｂ
「Huh?」
Natsuki
「They say the way to a man's heart is through his stomach, don't they?」
Rikka
「Segawa-san...! That's not what I'm trying to...!」
％Ｂ
「Mmm～ Yeah, you might be right. I already think Rikka's cooking's the best at this point.」

Natsuki
「So he says. Rikka?」
Rikka
「Ah, uuuh... Don't make me so happy when Segawa-san's here... You're making me smile too much.」

She's doing her best to hold her expression back from melting into a smile.

Natsuki
「It's a shame, though. There's just one thing that this lunchbox still needs.」
％Ｂ
「Hm?」
Rikka
「What might that be?」
It doesn't look like anything's missing from what I can see. It looks delicious.
Natsuki
「It needs cringiness!」
Rikka
「Cringiness? What?」
％Ｂ
「Sigh...」
I let out a big sigh as Rikka tilts her head in confusion.
Natsuki
「Your lunchboxes are way too proper and wifey. You know what I'm talking about. Like how girls make hearts out of shredded fish in manga.」

Rikka
「...! I-I wouldn't do anything like that!」
I've been envious of it before when I saw it in manga.
But if I saw someone with a lunch like that in real life, I'd probably roll my eyes and say they had a screw loose.

％Ｂ
「I think I'd be more surprised than happy if I opened it and saw that.」

Natsuki
「You two are so boring. I hear you can really only be cringey like that right after you start dating.」
Natsuki
「If you're like this now, then there's only gonna be less and less lover-like stimuli as you go... and things won't go well.」

％Ｂ
「Come on, don't say stuff like that.」
Rikka
「...Hey... Do you want me to put in shredded-fish hearts?」
A shredded-fish heart lunchbox from Rikka, huh?
Rikka
「Here you gooo, a Rikka-made lunch～ I made it with looots of love～ Enjoooy～」

％Ｂ
「Ohh, it's dazzlingly pink! Are these our faces?」
There's a decoration of our smiling faces in the center of a heart-shaped spread of shredded fish.

Rikka
「Mhm! Because I always want to be with you!」
Rikka
「First, you should start... by・eating・me♪」
％Ｂ
「Uooooooooohhhh, Rikkaaaaaaaaaaaa!!」
Rikka
「Noooo, you're supposed to eat the fooood～～～」
I know I said people who do that have a screw loose, but I think I might wanna try it...
％Ｂ
「...You don't have to do it if you don't want to.」
Natsuki
「You totally wanted it just now, didn't you?」
％Ｂ
「Whatever could you be talking about? Hahaha.」
Natsuki
「If you wanna eat one, then you should just say so. Why are all men so weirdly stubborn?」

％Ｂ
「I would love to eat one!」
Natsuki
「You sure changed your mind quickly!!」
％Ｂ
「I mean, of course, only if you're okay with it, Rikka. This lunchbox looks delicious and I just love it. I was just thinking something like that might be nice every now and then, you know～?」
Natsuki
「You're desperate, aren't you?」
％Ｂ
「Of course I am. Anything to get to eat a love-filled lunch from Rikka.」

％Ｂ
「I take in both nutrients and affection from Rikka's lunches. So what do you say?」


Rikka
「Mhm... I'll try it some time. But don't expect too much, okay?」
Natsuki
「Sigh... I dunno what to say. Well, I'm just glad you guys are getting along so well.」
％Ｂ
「Hm?」
Rikka
「Huh?」
Natsuki
「Title: "The cringey music room couple." That one's a candidate for the grad-album.」
Natsuki
「Thank you two so very much for allowing me to chronicle the golden years of your youth～」
％Ｂ
「Hooooold on! Wait a second, Segawa!」
Rikka
「Delete that right this second!」
all
Natsuki
「Ahahahaha!」
Our lunch break continued on noisily.
Days like these aren't so bad every now and then.
Shuuichi
「Now that the long exam period is over, committee work resumes today. Let's all do our best, everyone!」

We're having an event organization committee meeting for the first time since our exam hiatus.
Natsuki
「You sure seem composed today, Nirasawa. You do well on exams or something?」

Shuuichi
「Not bad, from what I've gotten back so far. I have Kaori-san on my side, after all.」

Ahh, now that I think about it, she graduated from here, didn't she?
She probably has the strategies and mindset for the exam all figured out. She's the perfect person to ask for help studying.

Shuuichi
「What about you, Segawa? I don't see you making the usual depressed eggplant face.」
Natsuki
「I had not a god nor buddha on my side, but Rikka-sama. Her guesses about the material were totally spot-on!」

I guess she's referring to when they were talking before exams.
I can't tell if Rikka's amazing or if Segawa's just lucky...
Natsuki
「Hmhmh! Wanna see who did better?」
Shuuichi
「Hohoh... I'll take you up on that challenge. How about one cafeteria A lunch?」
Natsuki
「How stingy. Two A lunches! And an almond jelly dessert!」

Shuuichi
「Bringing out the big bets, are we? Then I'm gonna add on the special Chinese food meal!」

Natsuki
「You must be awfully confident to throw out the most expensive thing on the cafeteria menu like that. But that's weak. Three special Chinese meals!」

％Ｂ
「How about you guys stop around there? The amount of money on the line's going up crazy fast...」

Shuuichi
「Kukuku! I can hardly believe you're the one I competed with for the title of ace striker. What's wrong, you're defanged now that you've got a girlfriend?」

％Ｂ
「What did you just say? Well, I can't back down after hearing that now, can I?」
I dunno what kinda scores we're talking about for Segawa and Shuuichi, but I had Rikka helping me study this time.

And I feel pretty good about how I did too.
all
I'm not gonna lose!
Marika
「U-Um... Could I join in too, then? I... kind of want some almond jelly...」


Rikka
「I think I'll participate too.」
all
Shuuichi
「...Segawa. Fighting, gambling, it's just not the right thing to do, is it? We Are the World, get what I mean?」


Natsuki
「You're so right～ We're talking "only one" here, not "number one"～ We shouldn't be comparing against each other～」

...And so the curtain falls on our competition before it even begins.
all
Shuuichi
「...Ahem. Anyway, small talk aside. There's only half a month left before the Tanabata Festival, our school's big summer event.」

Shuuichi
「Summer break starts after this week, but the committee will continue activities through break as we have in previous years.」

Shuuichi
「I won't force anyone to work, but I would like those of you who can to do so.」
Committee Members
「Okay!」
We all nod in unison.
Shuuichi
「That's all from me. Next we'll have each of the role representatives for the festival speak... starting with the concert team.」

all
Ishizuka
「I'm Ishizuka, the one in charge of the concert team. We have again had a large number of comments from the school's participants pertaining to adjustments to the concert program.」

Ishizuka
「We are planning on hosting a meeting on the matter with the performers after school this Wednesday.」

Ishizuka
「There are currently a mountain of things that need to be cleared away before we begin summer break, so those of you in the concert team, please prepare for things to get busy. I hope I can count on your assistance.」
Concert Team Members
「Yes!」
Shuuichi
「Then next is the after-festival team.」
all
We all get to work on our own stuff after the meeting.
％Ｂ
「Wonder if everyone's here already.」
Marika
「I think so? Oh, looks like people are here～」
all
I can hear lots of noise from inside the classroom.
Okihara-senpai's sent me a LIME message about how she's going to be late because she's helping with her class's Tanabata Festival work, so it's probably Ousaka and Yukimura.

％Ｂ
「Hey everyone! Let's all do our best together again starting to... brogh!?」
Something huge and round smacks me right in the forehead, and I fall backward into the hallway.

Marika
「A-Are you okay!?」
％Ｂ
「Ouch, ouch... Ow!? Wh-What the heck is this...?」
There's a small girl wearing our school uniform with a big sphere over her.

Sora
「...I messed up. Are you hurt?」
％Ｂ
「Are you... Ousaka?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
She removes the sphere to reveal Ousaka, with her hair plastered to her face with sweat.

％Ｂ
「The heck are you doing? And what is this?」
Sora
「The moon... The sole satellite orbiting Earth, the third planet from the sun in our solar system. It's the fifth-biggest satellite in the―」

％Ｂ
「No, there's no need to explain that much.」
all
She's right, it is the moon.
It's textured with craters and mountains, and the coloring's strangely detailed... It's incredibly realistic.

Sora
「You said we'd make celestial bodies with wire and paper. This is the test product.


」
％Ｂ
「Ahh～ I see. So why were you wearing it?」

Touko
「I put it on her because there was a big hole for the light bulb. It was perfect for her. Didn't it look cute on her?」
Sora
「I wanted you to see it. But I miscalculated the spacing.」
％Ｂ
「I guess you could say it's perfect for her, yeah... but we can't use that.」

Sora
「Why not? ...There shouldn't be any mistakes...」
％Ｂ
「There are definitely no issues... Or more like it's way better than anything an amateur could make.」
Touko
「Whaaat? Let's use iiit. Fluffyhead worked so hard on it.」
％Ｂ
「I'll acknowledge that, but we've only got this room to work with in terms of space. It won't be nearly enough to display what you can see from Shionagi if it's at that scale.」


Sora
「That would be a problem.」
％Ｂ
「Right? I'm thinking we could use small, different-colored light bulbs for most of the stars, and make compact models of the stars that we especially wanna show off out of wire and paper.」
％Ｂ
「But you're right that it'd be a waste to not use it, yeah. Okay, let's put this moon up on display in one of the corners of the room.」

Touko
「Wow, you're nice.」
％Ｂ
「Ousaka put a lot of work into this. It's a great display for the astronomy club.」

all
Misa
「I apologize for my tardiness. I was helping my class with our event for the festival.」
Misa
「Oh, everyone is already here! Let's all do the best we can again, starting today!」

％Ｂ
「Hello, Okihara-senpai. Your timing's perfect.」
％Ｂ
「Let's go over the general situation together now that we're all here.」
all
Most of the naturalist club's portion of the collaborative display is finished, and all that's left is the little details.

We could probably finish those all today too.
All that's left after that is pretty much just to take care of the fish.
％Ｂ
「―And so I was thinking we could finish the ocean this week, and move onto the stars starting next week.」

Misa
「Yes. Thank you very much.」

Sora
「...*nod*」
And so our preparations for the Tanabata Festival resume.
