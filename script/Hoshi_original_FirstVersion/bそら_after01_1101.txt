It's November. I'm going out with Sora on her day off to see the office spaces I'm considering renting.

There are a few candidates, and I'm lost trying to choose between them.
We walk into a family restaurant to take a break after taking a look through all of them.

％Ｂ
「Hmm, they've all kinda got their pros and cons.」
I murmur as I look over the floor plans and rent costs I got from the realtor.

％Ｂ
「This office is good for traffic, but it's kinda too spaced out.」

Sora
「High rent too. The down payment becomes higher.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. This one's the perfect size and it's cheap...」

Sora
「But it's an old building. The crack mending was obvious from the outside.」

％Ｂ
「Exactly. I know I wouldn't wanna hire an architect whose office is inside a building like that.」

Sora
「...How about this one?」
％Ｂ
「Oh, that one's a no-go. They're doing a good job of hiding it, but it's an illegitimate construction.」

Sora
「...I would've been fooled...」
％Ｂ
「It's something you could only notice if you knew how to read blueprints. Hmm... But I guess that means this is the only option that's left...」

There aren't any problems at all with the floor plan, rent, or looks.
The only thing is...
％Ｂ
「...It's kinda close to the Azuma Architectural Firm...」
I'm supposed to be independent now, but I'd be like a kid who's still clinging to his parents like this.
Or maybe not, since there'd be two major roads between us?
Sora
「But this is the most realistic choice.」
％Ｂ
「...Yeah.」
I guess we've pretty much decided, then.
all
％Ｂ
「Okay, then next on the list is furniture for the office. I'll need a desk, a chair, some shelves, a TV, and a water boiler...」

Sora
「...You'll need a place for clients to sit when people want to hire you.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, you're right. We're gonna need more than I thought. It'll probably cost a lot for everything, so I guess we'll get some cheap used furniture.」


Sora
「...No. You should spend money for those.」
％Ｂ
「Huh? Why?」
Sora
「...It'll leave a different impression on clients. What would someone who wants to hire you for a remodeling job think if the office wasn't pretty?」


％Ｂ
「Yeah, it wouldn't leave a good impression... Okay, then let's make the office furniture classy and stylish.」


Sora
「...*nod*」
all
I pick out the furniture after getting Sora's advice and arrange for its delivery.
％Ｂ
「And now I need to...」
Sora
「...Set up a website for advertising.」
％Ｂ
「Oh yeah, there's that.」
When I worked at Azuma-san's firm, we often got requests through email at first, and only then would clients actually come to the firm to speak in person.


And most importantly, I'll be able to introduce and advertise my work there.

％Ｂ
「But I can't make a website for the firm myself. I wonder how much it costs to get a web designer to do it.」


Sora
「...No issues. I'll do it.」
％Ｂ
「Wha, seriously? You can do that?」
Sora
「...I learned how after starting my current job.」
％Ｂ
「Wow...」
I've known Sora's smart since we were in high school, but I find myself yet again impressed at the breadth of her talent.

％Ｂ
「Could I ask you to do that, then?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
Sora
「...But there's something else you need to do right away.」
％Ｂ
「What's that? I'll do it.」
Sora
「...I want you to decide on a name for the firm.」
％Ｂ
「Oh... Yeah, now that you mention it.」
After I made the arrangements for the office space and everything too...
％Ｂ
「The name... Hmm... Teacher's was just the Azuma Architectural Firm... Maybe I'll just go with something straightforward like the "％Ａ Architectural Firm" too...」


Sora
「...Safe choice.」
％Ｂ
「Maybe "％Ａ Architectural Design"... I'm not really feeling it. I feel like I want something a little flashier.」


Sora
「..."Nebula Architectural Firm."」
％Ｂ
「N-Nebula?」
Sora
「...The dust clouds in space. The ones like the Rosette Nebula and the Eagle Nebula are pretty flashy. The Crab Nebula that's a supernova remnant in Taurus isn't bad either.」

％Ｂ
「I've seen nebulas in photos before. Like the Andromeda Nebula.」
Sora
「...Andromeda is a galaxy. It used to be a nebula, but it's been reclassified as a galaxy.」


％Ｂ
「O-Oh, really...」
Sora
「...If you're going for that, then "Galaxy Architectural Firm."」
％Ｂ
「I feel like I'll never be able to live up to that name... Putting "Galaxy" on a small firm like mine...」

Sora
「...A smaller name... "Cosmos Space Architectural Firm," or "Apollo Architectural Firm," or "Saturn V Architectural Firm."」


They're small compared to galaxies, but those don't really have anything to do with architecture...

％Ｂ
「A-Anyway, I'll think of something. I'll let you know once I've decided.」

Sora
「...*nod*」
