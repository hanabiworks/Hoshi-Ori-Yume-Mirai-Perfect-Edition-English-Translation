「Fuaaahh～～! ...Tired.」
I studied together with Rikka again yesterday, and did some last-minute studying after I walked her home too.

I guess that must have led to me not getting a full night of sleep.
But after a little bit, my consciousness sharpens.
％Ｂ
「I can't imagine not getting a good score at this point.」
Half of it's me trying to talk myself into it, but the other half is actual confidence.
I guess it really is true that getting a girlfriend gets you more motivated.
％Ｂ
「I need to do my best to end up with results I can be proud of, so it was worth it for Rikka to help me out with studying―」

％Ｂ
「...Hm? Who's here this early?」
％Ｂ
「Yes, I'm comiiing... What?」
There's an unexpected person displayed in the intercom monitor.
Rikka
「Good morning.」
％Ｂ
「Morning, Rikka. What are you doing here this early? Forget something here yesterday?」

Rikka
「No. Have you had breakfast yet?」
％Ｂ
「Nope. Just woke up.」
Rikka
「That's good. You didn't answer over LIME or even when I called.」
％Ｂ
「Wait, seriously? Oh yeah, I might've forgotten to charge my phone last night.」
Smartphones are convenient, but they go through battery real quickly.
Rikka's got her student bag, as well as the same tote bag that she brought with her when she made me food the other day.

％Ｂ
「You didn't ask me if I ate yet 'cause...?」
Rikka
「I thought I'd make you food... Maybe you didn't want me to?」
％Ｂ
「I'm totally fine with it. But why?」
Rikka
「Exams start today. I thought I should feed you something nutritious so you could do your best.」


％Ｂ
「Yeah, I wouldn't be able to help with the committee if I did end up getting failing grades.」

Rikka
「...Is that all?」
She puffs up her cheeks a bit sulkily.
Rikka
「We're... going on a date, aren't we? The committee's important too, but I want to be with you lots over summer break too.」


％Ｂ
「Yeah. I wanna have lots of fun with you too. Anyway, come in.」

Rikka
「Okay. Please excuse me, then.」
Rikka
「I'll borrow your kitchen. I'll start getting breakfast ready, so you should wash up and get changed.」

Rikka swiftly puts an apron on and starts pulling ingredients out from her bag.

％Ｂ
「Suuure thing. Thanks.」
all
Knowing that my girlfriend's here to make me breakfast when I'd usually have to do that myself fills my heart.

I'm the happiest guy in the world.
I head to the bathroom as I begin to hear the sound of a kitchen knife knocking against a cutting board.

％Ｂ
「Ohh... I haven't seen a breakfast this impressive in a while.」
Rikka
「Mmhehe. I'm glad you like it.」
My lovely girlfriend smiles happily from across the table.

I see grilled fish, miso soup, boiled okra, freshly cooked rice...
They all smell so good.
Even just the miso soup's got a ton of stuff in it. Pork, carrots, daikon, cabbage, seaweed, tofu, with a delicate sprinkling of green onions on top.
％Ｂ
「Didn't this take you a while?」
Rikka
「Not too long if you cook everything at the same time.」
She says that as if it were simple, but I know that's hard to pull off.
Even one thing at a time's a lot of work for a cooking beginner like me.
％Ｂ
「I'm the luckiest guy in the world to get to eat this nice of a breakfast. Let's eat!」

Rikka
「Hehe. Please, enjoy.」
％Ｂ
「Slurp... Sluuurp... Hot!」
Rikka
「Geez, it's because you were drinking too fast. The miso soup's still really hot. You need to drink it slowly.」


Rikka
「Here, have some cold tea.」
％Ｂ
「Thanks... Gulp, gulp... Phew.」
I chill the burning parts of my mouth.
Rikka
「We still have time, don't we? Let's take our time eating.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, since I don't have to take the time to make breakfast now. I'll take my time and savor your cooking, Rikka.」

Rikka
「Hehe, please do. Then I'll eat too. Fhh, fhh... Slurp... Mhm, good.」

all
We sit back and enjoy Rikka's cooking, and I do the cleanup.

I have a lot more time to get ready for school too.
％Ｂ
「Rikka. I'll lock up, so you step out first.」
Rikka
「Okay... Oh.」
Rikka starts to put her shoes on, apparently notices something, and then comes back to me.

Rikka
「Your necktie's crooked. Hehe, even though it was straight when you first got changed. Stay still a little.」


％Ｂ
「Oh... Sure.」
Rikka wraps her slender, pretty fingers around my necktie.
We're pretty much right up against each other. I can even see her eyelashes in full detail when I look down.

Rikka
「Hmmh... So this is how you tie your tie.」
％Ｂ
「This is the way my dad taught me. I didn't think girls would know how to tie one, though.」

Rikka
「It's part of some kinds of fashion. And the girls at my middle school wore neckties too.」

％Ｂ
「Middle school Rikka, huh? I'm interested.」
Rikka
「It would be boring to hear. It was just me going to school every day.」
Rikka
「Let me know if it's hard to breathe, okay?」
I feel a slight tightening around my neck.
The comfortable pressure makes me tilt my neck more upright.
Rikka
「Is it uncomfortable?」
％Ｂ
「It's just about right. Thanks. And...」
Rikka
「...?」
Her nice smell and soft warmth awaken a slight hunger in me.
％Ｂ
「I was thinking maybe I could get a kiss for the road～」
Rikka
「...A kiss? Sigh... What are you talking about, geez...?」
％Ｂ
「Guess that's a no, then...」
Rikka
「...Here.」
％Ｂ
「Huh?」
Rikka
「Mm～～～～～...」
She closes her eyes and awaits a kiss. I hold her tight.
％Ｂ
「I'm going... Chu.」
Rikka
「Mm, chu... Have a good day.」
Rikka
「So... um... I'm going to school too.」
％Ｂ
「Ah... I get what you're saying.」
I close my eyes.
Rikka
「I'm going... Mmm～ chu.」
％Ｂ
「Have a good day.」
Rikka
「Hehe. I'll be waiting outside.」
all
％Ｂ
「Ahhh～ My girlfriend's so cute...」
％Ｂ
「No, no. I've got exams starting today. I gotta put my all into it.」
I'm done checking the stove and such.
The air conditioning and lights are off.
I lock the door after the final check and step outside.
％Ｂ
「It's kinda weird walking to school with you, Rikka.」

Rikka
「That's true. We may live in the same direction, but our homes are pretty far apart.」
We're walking to school since we have the time.
I feel like everything on the way to school's more beautiful when I'm walking holding hands with my girlfriend.

Rikka
「Hey... Could I come make breakfast for you again?」
％Ｂ
「I'd be grateful, but isn't it a lot of work?」
Rikka
「Not if it isn't every day.」
％Ｂ
「Then could you?」
Rikka
「I'll come every day until Friday for now, then. I want you to do the best you can on your exams.」

％Ｂ
「I've really gotta focus when I'm taking those exams, then. Oh, I'll pay for the ingredients if you're gonna do that. I'll come shopping with you too.」


Rikka
「Really? Are you free after school today?」
％Ｂ
「Sure. I was thinking it'd be nice if we could study together too.」
Rikka
「Hehe, me too. Let's study together after doing the groceries, then.」
And so I fill up my schedule with Rikka, and she does the same.

Rikka and I walk into the classroom together.
We stopped holding hands once we got near school. We didn't want people to think we were showing off.

I dunno how many people here know that we're dating, but there's no reason for us to go out of our way to let it be known.
If our friends know about us, then that's enough.
Natsuki
「Good morning!」
％Ｂ
「Morning.」
Rikka
「Good morning, Segawa-san.」
Natsuki
「Ohhh? Walking to school together today, are we～? Would you like me to take a photo to commemorate?」

％Ｂ
「Don't need it. Right, Rikka?」
Rikka
「Mhm.」
all
Natsuki
「Hohoh, Rikka... Rikka... Rikka, I see!」
She smirks evilly.
Right. No one else knows.
％Ｂ
「It's weird to just keep calling each other by our last names, isn't it? So we decided to switch to first names.」

Natsuki
「I think it's nice. Really feels like you're dating.」
Natsuki
「Well, I'm happy to see your relationship progressing. Please allow me to be the cameraman at your wedding!」

％Ｂ
「You're moving way too fast. By the way, how's exam prep going for you?」

Natsuki
「You're asking that now!? When here I am, trying to brighten things even a little!」


Rikka
「That's called escapism. Sigh... You're hopeless. I think we can still at least guess at what's going to be on the exam, so come with me.」

Natsuki
「Rikka! I've always believed in you!」
all
Rikka leads Segawa over to her seat.
Those two are really great friends.
I guess opposites really do attract.

％Ｂ
「Now then. I think I'll spend the time I've got left to look over the important bits again.」
I'm gonna get good marks on these exams!
Just you wait, date!!
