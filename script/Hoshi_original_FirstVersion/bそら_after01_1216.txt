The first two weeks after accepting Fukuzawa-san's remodeling commission were incredibly busy.

The commission was to change the house's interior to a barrier-free design and expand the floor plan, but he also wanted me to add my own design on top of that.

After going to Fukuzawa-san's home to see it for myself, I made various suggestions such as adjusting the placement of walls in order to allow more light in and making the hallways brighter.


I'd take the ideas that Fukuzawa-san liked and immediately try incorporating them into a blueprint after getting back to the firm.

And the next day, I would go back to Fukuzawa-san's house with those blueprints in hand.
I've been doing nothing but move back and forth between the firm and the remodeling site these past two weeks.
And at the same time, I've needed to hire the contractors to undertake the actual construction work.

「Sigh... Of course I've been busy... I have to do all the stuff I had the other staff members do back at Teacher's firm myself now.」


I can't help but want to vent a little with how busy I am.
But I started up my own firm knowing this would happen.
I don't have the time to be standing still!
％Ｂ
「...Hello? Is this the Miyamoto Group? Is Miyamoto-san...? Oh, hello. It's been far too long since we last spoke. I'm ％Ａ. I used to work at the Azuma Architectural Firm.」


％Ｂ
「Yes... I've become independent, with my own personal firm... Yes, exactly.」

％Ｂ
「I apologize for my lateness in announcing everything. And I apologize again for the sudden request, but there is a matter I would like your assistance with... Yes, I can send you the specifics via email...」


Sora
「...Welcome home.」
％Ｂ
「Heeey... You're here...」
I come back to my apartment to find Sora waiting there for me.
The room's filled with a delicious smell.
Sora
「...I made food. Let's eat together.」
％Ｂ
「Thanks so much... I skipped lunch today 'cause I was so busy.」
Sora
「...No overexerting yourself. You have to eat properly.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, I know, but... To be honest, I'm so busy I don't even have the time to go buy food.」

Sora
「...Let's eat for now. Wash your hands.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, okay.」
all
Sora and I eat dinner together at the table.
％Ｂ
「Mgmgh... This fish is great.」
Sora
「...I asked my mom how to make it.」
％Ｂ
「Seriously? Guess it must be a mother's touch seeping through, then. Hamh... Mgmgh... Yeah, it's great!」

Sora
「...There's some left over, so you can have it for lunch tomorrow. You can have lunch that way.」

％Ｂ
「Sorry about all this.」
Sora
「...No issues.」
％Ｂ
「But you're busy now too, right? There's that new show for the planetarium... Didn't you say the deadline's coming up soon?」


Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「You come up with any good ideas?」
Sora
「...*shake shake*」
Sora
「...All I know right now is I want lots of people to feel that the stars are closer to them than they think.」

Sora
「Something to make people who've never come to the planetarium before just decide to walk in because they're interested...」


Sora
「And the show would make them feel closer to the stars after watching.」

％Ｂ
「You've got a good vision for what kind of thing you want to make, but I guess that's what makes it hard for you. So you wanna make a show that'll get people to feel closer to the stars...」


％Ｂ
「...I've got an idea that popped into my head just now. Do you want to hear it?」
Sora
「...*nod* Tell me.」
％Ｂ
「How about the moon?」
Sora
「...The moon...」
％Ｂ
「I know you said you don't really do stuff about the moon back when we went to that hot springs inn, but I still think the moon's the closest thing in the sky to us here on Earth.」


Sora
「...We see it every night.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, I think it'll be easier to think of the moon as familiar 'cause you see it almost every night. I think people think they know a lot about the moon, when they actually don't.」


％Ｂ
「Maybe something like secrets of the moon that people don't know... I think it'd be a pretty interesting show if you could introduce something like that.」

Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「There are always legends and folklore like Princess Kaguya and moon bunnies too.」

％Ｂ
「But you can also talk about more real stuff like the Apollo spaceflight and the moon landing too.」

％Ｂ
「I think a show that talks more in detail about the moon itself like that would be cool.」

Sora
「...A show that talks in detail about the moon itself...」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, I personally think the moon would be good material.」
Sora stops eating and lapses into deep thought.
Sora
「...Mixing folklore and real-life events into descriptions of the moon, fusing a sense of mystery and reality... It might work.」

Her eyes glitter.
Sora
「...Good job.」
She gives me her favorite thumbs-up pose.
％Ｂ
「Yeah. It's just a thought, but I'd be happy if you considered it.」
Sora
「...I'll put extra portions of the fish in your lunch tomorrow as thanks.」
She smiles.
