We walk down the sunset-bathed hallway.
Segawa and I are roaming, on the search for springtimes of youth, for grad-alb committee work.
But I think we're already experiencing the springtime of youth ourselves, as a boyfriend and girlfriend together after school.

So I want to make it even more the case.
％Ｂ
「Hey... You free tomorrow or the day after?」
Natsuki
「Tomorrow or the day after? You mean Saturday or Sunday? Mmm... I don't think I have anything in particular... Is there event committee work or something?」

％Ｂ
「No, I wanted to hang out somewhere with you.」
Natsuki
「Hang out...?」
％Ｂ
「Well, it'd be a date, plain and simple.」
Natsuki
「A... date!? Huh? Huh? Wh-What, what? Wh-Why so suddenly!?」

％Ｂ
「Uh, it's more like I checked if you had any plans 'cause I didn't wanna be sudden about asking you...」

Natsuki
「Wha, but... but... You can't just suddenly ask if I'm free... I have to mentally prepare myself, you know...」

％Ｂ
「Uhh... I'll do it over, then. Ahem... Is it okay if I ask you right now if you're free either this Saturday or Sunday?」


Natsuki
「Y-Yeah, you can...」
％Ｂ
「All right, I'll ask then. Are you free either this Saturday or Sunday?」
...What the heck am I doing?
Natsuki
「Urgh... I-I don't... have any plans in particular...」
％Ｂ
「All right. Let's go on a date, then.」
Natsuki
「Hah... Hauh...!?」
％Ｂ
「What's the point if you freak out anyway...」
Natsuki
「B-But... I can't help it... I've never... been on anything like a date before...」

％Ｂ
「But we went to the ocean together before.」
Natsuki
「We went there to redo those photos that time... so I wasn't really thinking about it that way...」

％Ｂ
「Then we can just do it in the same way. You don't have to think of it as a date. If you've got the time, let's go hang out somewhere.」


Natsuki
「Uuh... Um... Okay...」
％Ｂ
「All right. Great.」
％Ｂ
「So where should we go? If there's anywhere you wanna go, just let me know. Oh, and which works better for you, Saturday or Sunday?」


Natsuki
「Both days are fine for me... but there is a place I want to go.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, you should've just told me, then. Where? The movies? Or the amusement park? Wanna go to the zoo and take photos?」

Segawa pulls out her wallet and takes two tickets out from inside.
Natsuki
「I want to go to this...」
％Ｂ
「...The 7th Annual Shionagi Gallery Special Exhibition, "Lovers"...?」
The word "lovers" is specifically written out to be in English.
Natsuki
「It's a photo exhibition. They pick a theme every year and display photos taken by cameramen who have connections to Shionagi...」


％Ｂ
「And so the theme this year is "lovers"...?」
Natsuki
「It-It's just a coincidence, okay!? I didn't do this on purpose or anything, okay!?」
％Ｂ
「I don't think you could've done it on purpose... but you have two tickets, so...」

Natsuki
「Y-Yeah... I was... going to ask you to come with me somewhere too. The exhibition's only just started, so I thought eventually... you know...」

％Ｂ
「Oh, really?」
Natsuki
「W-We're kind of dating, so... I thought we should go on dates and stuff...」

％Ｂ
「Huh? We're only kind of dating?」
Natsuki
「N-No! We're fully dating! Perfectly dating! Wait...」
Her face fills up with redness all at once, and she starts looking around nervously at our surroundings.\n\r

This is kind of a new side to her...
％Ｂ
「So what you're saying is we were both thinking the same thing.」
Natsuki
「...I guess so.」
％Ｂ
「That kinda makes me happy. It really makes me feel like we're a couple.」
Natsuki
「Mhm... Me too.」
％Ｂ
「The photo exhibition sounds great. Let's go. That theme's perfect for us now anyway.」

Natsuki
「You sure? You don't have to tag along with my interests if you don't want to, you know.」

％Ｂ
「It's not like I don't want to. I wanna go 'cause I'm interested in it too.」
％Ｂ
「And besides, I told you, didn't I? I wanna learn more about you.」
Natsuki
「Oh... M-Mhm.」
％Ｂ
「I've never been to a photo exhibition or anything before, so you gotta teach me how to act once I'm there and stuff.」
Natsuki
「O-Okay... Got it.」
A photo exhibition with lovers as a theme.
I'm excited.
