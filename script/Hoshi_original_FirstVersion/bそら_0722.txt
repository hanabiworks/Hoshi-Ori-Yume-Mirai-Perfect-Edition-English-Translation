─Our second day of work.
Grade-School Boy A
「Take this!」
Shio-wan
「...」
...I knew this would happen.
Grade-School Boy B
「And this!」
Shio-wan
「...」
I knew it, of course...
I knew about kids who'd always come up and kick mascots like this... \n\r

Because I used to do the same thing back when I was a kid...
But I never would've thought I'd be on the receiving end...\n\r

I'm so sorry to whoever was in the costumes I kicked back then...
Staff
「Okaaay, no kicking. You'll make Shio-wan cry!」
I make crying gestures as slowly as possible.
Grade-School Boy A
「I don't see any tears!」
Shio-wan
「...」
Kh... Patience, patience...
I'd ruin our chance to earn the money we need if I lashed out here.
I just need to be patient here...
Shio-nyah
「...」
Shio-nyah's watching me nervously.
Don't worry, Sora.
I can take this much─
all
Grade-School Boy A
「Rraahhh!」
Whoa!? What's going on!? Something's pulling at my waist...???
─It-It's the tail! My tail's being pulled...!
Shio-wan
「...」
Shio-wan may always be in slow motion, but even he can't resist gravity.
Patience, patience... This is compensated for in the pay...
I slooowly start to get back up, reciting the mantra in my head.
Shio-wan
「Hgh...!?」
I see two familiar faces walking toward us.
It's... Segawa and Narusawa!?
Looks like they're in the middle of collecting cardboard.
They're holding a few sheets at their sides.
And Segawa's holding her camera in her other hand.
Natsuki
「I have to get a shot of the two of them working while I have the opportunity! Working part-time for the sake of the Tanabata Festival, now that's how you spend the golden years of your youth!」

Rikka
「I think it'd be a better use of our time to get as much cardboard as we can...」

Natsuki
「Non, non. Taking detours like this is a better use of our time, to enjoy our youth!」

Rikka
「But we don't know where they are, do we?」
Natsuki
「Marika said they're walking around the marketplace to advertise for an event or something. I think we'll find them eventually if we keep wandering around like this.」


Shio-wan
「...」
You've gotta be kidding me...
They're totally just straight-up looking for us...
all
Shio-nyah
「...」
Sora's apparently noticed them too. Her movements are stiff.

Natsuki
「Oh, it's Shio-nyah! And Shio-wan too!」
Rikka
「Shio-nyah? Shio-wan? What are those?」
Natsuki
「You don't know? They're Shionagi's unofficial mascot characters!」
Segawa runs up to Sora.
Natsuki
「She's always got this weird, cute face!」
Shio-nyah
「...」
all
Shio-nyah falls over in response.
Natsuki
「Oh, that's it! The way she reacts is so great!」
She excitedly takes a photo of Shio-nyah on the ground.
Rikka
「...」
all
Shio-wan
「Hgh...!?」
Whoa!?
Th-That scared me...
Narusawa's suddenly standing in front of me.
She's staring intently at my... I mean, Shio-wan's face...
Rikka
「...」
Wh-What's she want?
Rikka
「...What a weird face.」
Shunk...!
Shio-wan
「...」
It's not like she was actually saying it about me, but it still feels like I got stabbed in the heart.
Rikka
「Anyway, I thought we were going to go look for the two of them.」
Natsuki
「Mmm... I got photos of Shio-nyah and Shio-wan, so I think I'm good now.」
Rikka
「Really. Let's go get more cardboard, then.」
Natsuki
「Sure thing. Bye, Shio-wan! Shio-nyah!」
I slowly wave goodbye to Segawa.
all
Looks like they didn't notice it was us.
Grade-School Boy B
「Take this!」
Shio-wan
「...」
Patience...
％Ｂ
「Oh man... Finally done. Another day of hard work.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「I got kicked so much today... I stopped counting after twenty...」

Sora
「...I fell over 38 times.」
％Ｂ
「But, now we've got 36,000 yen total. We're close to halfway there.」

Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「By the way, why are you standing so far away?」
Usually she'd be standing right next to me, but she's been keeping her distance somewhat since we got off work.

Sora
「...I sweat lots. It's embarrassing.」
％Ｂ
「I don't mind the smell of your sweat, though.」
Sora
「...You say weird things sometimes
, Ryou

.」
Huh? Was that weird?
％Ｂ
「We really do sweat a lot doing this, though. I weighed myself before taking a bath yesterday, and I was two kilos lighter. I could pretty much wring the sweat out from my shirt too.」


％Ｂ
「Changing's easy for me since I'm a guy, but it must be a pain for you.」
Sora
「...My underwear's still cold.」
Sora
「But, no issue. I've thought of a solution. I'll put it into action tomorrow.」

She gives me a thumbs-up. She seems pretty confident about her plan.
