Natsuki
「You're laaaate! How could you be here later than me when you're supposed to be the assistant!?」

％Ｂ
「What do you mean, late... It's still thirty minutes before we're supposed to meet up...」
I remember Okihara-senpai said that the last time we were here, Segawa got here before anyone else and got a seminar on fish from Senpai beforehand.

Which is exactly why I decided to come decently early today too, just in case...

％Ｂ
「How early did you get here...?」
Natsuki
「Whaaat? About an hour before the time we agreed on, I guess...?」
％Ｂ
「That's way too early. What the heck was the point of the meet-up time then?」

Natsuki
「You think so? Maybe we should've made the meet-up time an hour earlier, then?」

I bet Segawa would probably have just come an hour earlier than that if we did...

％Ｂ
「Ugh... You're always so crazy about taking photos.」
Natsuki
「Ahaha. Yeah, it's just way too much fun for me.」
％Ｂ
「Well, that's fine... So where are we shooting? Around the rocks again?」

Natsuki
「No... I'm planning on doing it a different way today.」
％Ｂ
「A different way?」
Natsuki
「Hey... Do you know what's important when you're taking photos?」
％Ｂ
「Huh? Uhh, stuff like focus, exposure, and composition...?」
Natsuki
「Wrooong. Those are important too of course, but there's something that's even more important.」

％Ｂ
「What's that?」
Natsuki
「To become a part of the subject's world.」
％Ｂ
「...How very philosophical...」
Natsuki
「Parents take photos from the viewpoint of a child when they take pictures of their kids, right? And if you're trying to take a picture of an athlete, you need to match your breathing to theirs.」


Natsuki
「And when you take scenery photos, you let yourself melt away into the scenery itself.」

％Ｂ
「...I kinda feel like I get what you're trying to say.」
Natsuki
「So taking that into account, about those fish photos I took last week. Those are from the human perspective. Which makes them into specimens. It's like you said. They're the kinda photos you'd see in field guides.」


％Ｂ
「You don't want field guide photos? They're nice, pretty photos.」
Natsuki
「Misa-san wanted me to take photos of them "living in their natural habitat." The photos aren't supposed to be for a field guide.」

％Ｂ
「Oh... B-But she said those photos were fine―」
Natsuki
「Yeah. Those are probably good photos on their own. That's why Misa-san okayed them. But I'm not okay with them...!」


Natsuki
「Do you really think I'd be satisfied if I ended up taking photos that weren't the ones that she requested?」

Natsuki
「A cameraman takes the photos that people want them to take, and more! There's no way a photo that I'm not okay with myself could satisfy the client's wishes!」


She's getting really passionate...
She seems to be in some kind of a super-serious mode right now...
Natsuki
「That's why I decided. I'm going to redo all of those photos!」
all
She suddenly starts taking her clothes off.
％Ｂ
「H-Hey! ...What the heck are you doing!?」
She tosses aside article after article of clothing before my eyes.
％Ｂ
「Wait... Wait a second! I know there's no one around, but you can't just―」

Natsuki
「Tadaaa! How do I look? I look good, right♪」
％Ｂ
「Wha... Oh... You're wearing a swimsuit...」
She pulls her camera out from her bag after stripping down to her swimsuit.
It's covered in a transparent plastic case.
Is that... a waterproof case?
％Ｂ
「Wait a second... You're not... Are you planning on diving?」
Natsuki
「Of course! The world of fish is underwater. Which means that if I want to get the same perspective so I can take pictures of them, I need to also go underwater!」


So that's how she's going to do this...
％Ｂ
「I get what you're trying to say, but you need to calm down. The beach isn't open yet.」

Natsuki
「But they're doing swimming classes in gym at school already.」
％Ｂ
「That's 'cause we have a temperature-controlled indoor pool. It's not even close to the same as Shionagi's sea.」
Natsuki
「Stop nitpicking! I'm the one who's going in the water. Anyway, counting on you to support me!」

all
She starts running toward the water.
％Ｂ
「Agh, hey! You can't just say that! Don't be─」
all
$$chr_gkbr
Natsuki
「～～～～～～! ～～～!!」
...She immediately comes running back after going up to her knees in water.
Natsuki
「What the heck!? What the heck!? It's so cold! I thought the ocean would be warm 'cause the sun's out today!」

％Ｂ
「Oh, come on... The ocean's nothing like a pool, so there's no way it'd get warm that easily...」

Natsuki
「R-Really? Is that how it works!?」
％Ｂ
「I'll do the underwater photography. I'm gonna go home and grab my swimsuit, so wait a bit.」

Natsuki
「No. Photography is my job.」
％Ｂ
「But it's dangerous to get in the ocean when it's this cold.」
Natsuki
「And that's why I had you come along.」
％Ｂ
「Huh?」
Natsuki
「You're going to watch over me. I'll come up when you tell me to.」

Natsuki
「I'll do everything you say.」
％Ｂ
「Uh... gh...」
Natsuki
「Please.」
％Ｂ
「...Fine. You better come up right away.」
Natsuki
「Okay! Thanks!」
all
She smiles happily and starts running back toward the water.
This time, she takes her time getting used to the cold water by dipping her toes in first.
％Ｂ
「Phew...」
But man... What else could I say with those trusting eyes turned toward me like that?

Segawa might trust me a lot more than I thought she did.\n \n\r

That makes me happy.
I watch over Segawa from above.
She spots a fish, gently submerges herself in the water, and slowly, stealthily approaches so she doesn't scare it, trying to get a shot.


Natsuki
「Pfah... Hahh, hahh... Aghh, so close... I almost got a good shot, but it got away.」

％Ｂ
「It's been about half an hour, so you should get out for a bit.」
Natsuki
「...Can I go for just a little longer? I wanna try getting that one that got away one more time.」

％Ｂ
「Segawa.」
Natsuki
「Uh... Okaaay.」
She reluctantly, but still obediently gets out from the water.
$$chr_gkbr
Natsuki
「It's cold! So cold! What the heck!? It's warmer in the water!」

％Ｂ
「Oh, you just think that. Your body would only get colder if you had stayed in the water.」

Natsuki
「Uuughh... But it's way too cold out here...」
％Ｂ
「It's 'cause you're wet. Hurry up and dry off with a towel before you catch a cold.」
Natsuki
「Ah... A towel...」
％Ｂ
「Wha...?」
You've gotta be kidding me...
％Ｂ
「...You didn't bring a towel?」
Natsuki
「...」
％Ｂ
「...You're...! How the hell do you forget to bring a towel when you're planning on swimming!?」
Natsuki
「Aha, ahaha... Just slipped my mind...」
％Ｂ
「...On that note, there's something I wanna ask you...」
Natsuki
「Mhm?」
％Ｂ
「You... brought underwear, right?」
Natsuki
「...」
％Ｂ
「You...! You're kidding! What are you, a grade schooler!? How obsessed with this stuff can you get!?」

Natsuki
「Oh man, I'm surprised myself. I didn't think I was this focused on the photography. Gotta hand it to myself.」

She's so positive it's become a double-edged sword for her...
％Ｂ
「The beach houses aren't open yet, so let's go buy a towel at the closest convenience store.」

Natsuki
「It-It's fine... I can just dry myself off with my own clothes for now.」
％Ｂ
「That's just gonna make your clothes wet. How are you gonna go home like that?」

Natsuki
「I-I'll go home wet.」
％Ｂ
「Dumbass. You'll get sick for sure.」
I take off my own shirt and hand it to her.
％Ｂ
「Here, wear this.」
Natsuki
「Wha... But then you'll have to go home wet.」

％Ｂ
「I'll be fine 'cause I'm not cold already. Just wear it.」
Natsuki
「But...」
I walk up to her and drape the shirt around her shoulders while she's hesitating.
％Ｂ
「There's less exposed skin this way, so it's better now, right?」
Natsuki
「Y-Yeah...」
％Ｂ
「Now make sure you sit in the sun so you can raise your body temperature again. No getting back in the water until then, all right?」

Natsuki
「...Okay.」
all
She sits down on the spot.
I move to sit to the left of her─
but then I decide to sit on her right.
Natsuki
「...? Why on that side?」
％Ｂ
「Just kinda felt like it.」
Natsuki
「...Oh.」
She looks away bashfully. She must've realized why I sat on her right side.

The reason is simple. I'm sitting upwind of her this way.
Natsuki
「...Thanks...」
％Ｂ
「You're welcome.」
％Ｂ
「More importantly, how are your fingertips? Do they hurt from the cold?」
Natsuki
「Uh... Oh, um... They're cold, but they don't hurt, so it's fine.」
％Ｂ
「Try touching my arm then.」
I hold my upper arm out toward her.
％Ｂ
「Just do it.」
She hesitantly touches my arm.
％Ｂ
「...Ghh... That's so cold...!」
Natsuki
「...You're warm.」
％Ｂ
「K-Keep touching for a bit... Think of it as an organic hand warmer.」
Natsuki
「You sure?」
％Ｂ
「...Yeah, but just my arm, all right? No touching my back or stomach.」
Natsuki
「...Are you just playing hard to get?」
％Ｂ
「Wha...?」
Touch♪
％Ｂ
「Ghhhhhhhhhh!!?」
Natsuki
「Ahah, you're sooo warm!」
％Ｂ
「Y-You... You're so...!」
She's touching my sides and face now. That hesitation from earlier's nowhere to be seen.
％Ｂ
「Wha!? Wait!? Hih!? Uih!? Hyaoh!?」
Natsuki
「Ahahahahah, your reactions are way too funny!」
％Ｂ
「It's cold! Stop, it's cold! Seriously, it's cold!」
Natsuki
「Fufufu! Just be a good boy and hand over your body heat as tribute. Here, is that cold? It's soooo warm for me♪」

％Ｂ
「Y-You...! You're getting too carried away!」
Natsuki
「You're the one who said it was okay to touch. And you were even playing hard to get. You were pretty much just telling me to touch you, weren't you?」


％Ｂ
「I wasn't playing hard to get! I told you not to touch 'cause it's seriously cold! Stop it, or I'll―」


Natsuki
「You're finished! Touch!」
She wraps herself around me with a hug.
％Ｂ
「Nooooooooooo!?」
Natsuki
「Ahahahah, you're so warm♪ You're a full-body warmer!」
％Ｂ
「F-Full-body warmer... Come on...」
Natsuki
「This is really warm, you know. Ahh, it's kinda relaxing.」

％Ｂ
「Ugh... I don't even care anymore, just do whatever...」
Natsuki
「Mhm, I'll do whatever...」
Female Tourist A
「Wow, people are already swimming. Is the beach open over here already?」

Female Tourist B
「There's no way. Maybe they're surfers. It's still too cold for the beach right now.」
Female Tourist A
「They look like a regular couple. Maybe they're just on a date? Oh, but the girlfriend's wearing a swimsuit.」

Female Tourist B
「She's hugging her boyfriend because it's so cold. Looks like it's too early for the beach here after all.」

％Ｂ
「...」
Natsuki
「...」
％Ｂ
「...Uhh... Ahem.」
Natsuki
「Nh... nnh...」
We slowly pull away.
Natsuki
「We... We were... mistaken for a couple...」
％Ｂ
「W-Well... I can see why... Yeah...」
Natsuki
「...I guess I might've been... hugging you...?」
％Ｂ
「...Yeah, you were... hugging me...」
Natsuki
「Okay...」
％Ｂ
「Y-Yeah...」
Natsuki
「...I-I think my body temperature's gotten up a decent amount now.」
％Ｂ
「Y-Yeah, looks like it... Your face is bright red.」
Natsuki
「Yours too...」
％Ｂ
「...Really...」
Natsuki
「...Okaaay... I'm plenty warm now, so I think I'll go try to get some photos again...」
％Ｂ
「Be... Be careful...」
Natsuki
「Yeah... Oh... Thanks for your shirt.」
％Ｂ
「No... No problem.」
Natsuki
「...I'm going...」
％Ｂ
「Right...」
all
It's more ridiculously embarrassing than it is awkward...
