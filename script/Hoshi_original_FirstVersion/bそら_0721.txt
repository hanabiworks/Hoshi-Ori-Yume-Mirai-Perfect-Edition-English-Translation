Today's our first day of work.
Sora and I go to the office of the local chamber of commerce again at 9 a.m., like we were told.

Staff
「Hey, morning.」
％Ｂ
「Good morning.」
Sora
「...Good morning.」
Staff
「I'm looking forward to working with you two starting today. Could you get changed right away?」

％Ｂ
「Oh, yes.」
I guess we're going to be given the uniforms we were measured for when we were here before.
I think I might kinda like the idea of working with Sora while wearing matching uniforms...

all
％Ｂ
「...」
I stand there, mouth agape, looking at myself in the mirror.
I guess it'd be more accurate to say that it isn't me in the mirror.
I'm looking at the mascot costume I'm currently inside.
And─
There's a cat next to me too. Sora's inside that one.
Staff
「Oh, looks like they were just the right size! You two look great!」

all
％Ｂ
「Um... What are these...?」
Staff
「They're the unofficial mascots we created for Shionagi. They're named "Shio-wan" and "Shio-nyah"!」

％Ｂ
「...Shio...wan, I see...」
So this dog with singular horizontal lines for eyes... is Shio-wan.
Sora
「...Nyah...」
And that blank-eyed cat... is Shio-nyah.
Staff
「I'll explain what you'll be doing, then.」
all
The job description was, as Sora said, similar to customer service.
We're being paid to advertise for the marketplace events while wearing these costumes.

We're supposed to take breaks every thirty minutes.
But we were also told to signal to a staff member if we end up approaching our limit. We need to be careful of heatstroke.

...And to top things off─
We have to play the part of the characters while we're wearing the costumes.
Shio-wan is apparently very careful about everything, and always moves in slow motion.
"As if time moved slowly just around Shio-wan. But he's still subject to gravity"...

Shio-nyah's an apathetic-looking cat, but she falls over whenever someone compliments her. The reason being she's too embarrassed to remain standing...

％Ｂ
「...We have to become these characters...」
Sora
「...」
I have to constantly move in slow motion, and Sora has to fall over every time she's complimented...

It's hard to see from inside, it's hot, and our heads are heavy.
I'm worried for Sora, with her lack of physical strength...
％Ｂ
「Sora... You gonna be all right?」
Sora
「...Mm.」
Shio-nyah gives me a heartfelt thumbs-up.
I can't see Sora's expression, but I can sense happiness radiating out from inside the costume. I guess she's actually pretty okay with this...

Staff
「We'll be counting on you, then.」
Sora... Shio-nyah and I walk out into the marketplace.
Elderly people out shopping widen their eyes in shock when they see us.

Yeah, I don't blame them...
It's not like anyone knows who these characters are...
Are we really gonna be able to advertise for the marketplace like this?

Grade-School Boy A
「Oh! It's Shio-nyah and Shio-wan!」
Excuse me!?
You know these characters!?
Grade-School Boy A
「Shio-nyah! Shio-wan!」
A boy comes running up to us.
Uh, let's see... I just need to move slowly, right...?
Shio-wan
「...」
I slowly, ever so slowly raise my hand and pat the boy on the head.

Grade-School Girl A
「Mom, it's Shio-nyah!」
And now a little girl approaches us with her mother.
Grade-School Girl A
「Shio-nyah, let's shake hands!」
Shio-nyah
「...」
Sora shakes hands with the little girl.
Grade-School Girl A
「You're so cute, Shio-nyah!」
Shio-nyah
「...」
all
Shio-nyah bashfully covers her face after being complimented and falls over.\n\r

And she does it pretty skillfully too. I wouldn't have expected her to be good at this sort of thing.
Grade-School Boy A
「Shio-wan, let's take a photo together!」
I make an OK sign as slowly as I can.
I can't talk, so I have to communicate entirely through gestures. And always in slow motion.

This is harder than I thought...
Thirty minutes pass, and we head back to the office to take a break.

I remove the head portion of the costume.
％Ｂ
「Pfah! ...Hahh, hahh... It's so hot!」
I'm already covered in sweat.
I look over at Sora. She's in the exact same state.
Sora
「...Hot...」
％Ｂ
「You okay?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
I hand Sora a bottle of water.
％Ｂ
「I guess they weren't lying when they said it was similar to customer service...」
Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「...Hm?」
Sora's staring at me.
％Ｂ
「Something up?」
Sora
「...*shake shake*」
Sora looks away, her face bright red.
％Ｂ
「What?」
Sora
「...Nothing.」
She's acting a little strangely.
％Ｂ
「If you've got something on your mind, then just tell me.」
Sora
「...You look like...」



％Ｂ
「Mhm?」
Sora
「...Like after we have sex.」
％Ｂ
「...I'm sorry?」
I look like I do after we have sex?
％Ｂ
「'Cause I'm all sweaty?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「Did I really sweat that much?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「Seriously? ...I had no idea.」
I wipe away my sweat with a towel.
％Ｂ
「Here, I'll wipe your sweat too. Look this way.」
Sora
「...Mm.」
Sora brings her face toward me, and I wipe as much of her sweat away as I can with a towel.
She closes her eyes like a kitten, letting me handle everything.
Her face is red from the heat.
I'd say she's the one who looks more like she does when we're doing it...
％Ｂ
「Okay, done.」
Sora
「...」
Sora opens her eyes, and we stare at each other for a while.
We bring our faces closer without planning to or anything, and kiss.
Sora
「...Mm...～～～ ...Mm, nh...」
Today's kiss tastes a little salty.
all
We head to school after finishing our first day of work.
Marika
「Oh, welcome back～」
Misa
「You two must have been working hard.」
We just happen to run into Shinozaki and Okihara-senpai as they're bringing some cardboard in.
％Ｂ
「Thanks, you two. How'd things go today?」
Marika
「Mmm～ Okay, I guess.」
all
Marika
「How was work?」
％Ｂ
「Well... It was harder than I thought it was gonna be.」
Marika
「Really. So what kind of "similar to customer service" stuff did you end up doing?」

％Ｂ
「We―」

Sora tugs on my shirt as I'm about to answer.
％Ｂ
「Hm?」
Sora
「...」
She's staring at me.
all
％Ｂ
「Uhh... It's kinda like... We're kinda helping introduce an event... Like, I guess you could say we're advertising for the marketplace... We had to walk around all day in this heat.」


Marika
「Hmm～ Yeah, that does sound tough～」
％Ｂ
「Yeah... Pretty much.」

Misa
「Marika-san, I will be checking on the fish tanks.」
Marika
「Oh, I'll come with. See you later, you two.」
％Ｂ
「Y-Yeah...」
all
％Ｂ
「...Why can't I tell them what we're doing at our job?」
Sora
「...It'd be embarrassing if people we know find out what we're doing. I'm sure everyone will come see if we tell them.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, that's definitely possible... I could see Segawa taking a ton of photos and stuff.」

％Ｂ
「Oh, right. Our pay...」
all
I pull out the envelope with today's pay.
I check the contents. 9,000 yen for today's work.
％Ｂ
「So that makes 18,000 between the two of us.」
62,000 yen to go to get to our goal of 80,000.
％Ｂ
「We'll have the money in no time at this rate. Let's do our best.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
