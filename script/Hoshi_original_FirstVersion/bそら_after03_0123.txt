「Phew... There we go.」
The first thing I do every morning once I get to work is sort through flyers and mail.

％Ｂ
「Why are there so many pizzeria flyers? ...Pizza Moon? Oh, this place looks pretty good... Maybe I'll order from them sometime.」

％Ｂ
「...Hm?」
There's a largish envelope in the pile of mail.
％Ｂ
「It's pretty heavy... It's from...」
There's a familiar-looking publishing company's name on it.
I unseal the envelope.
％Ｂ
「Oh...」
It's a magazine. "Living at Home."
There's a sticky note marking a specific page.
I open it to the page with the sticky note.
It's a section titled "This Week's Home Sweet Home," where readers introduce their own homes.

％Ｂ
「...No way!」
It's clearly Shuuichi's home. The one I designed.

I know Kaori-san said she was going to submit photos to try to get them to cover it, but I didn't think it'd actually happen...

％Ｂ
「Agh... Their photos are on this too!」
It's a photo of Shuuichi and Kaori-san in each other's arms in front of their house.
％Ｂ
「I can't believe they went with that pose... They've got guts, or maybe they're just that heads over heels for each other...」

My name's displayed prominently as the designer of the house in the details.

％Ｂ
「Oh, so my name's in this too...」
I don't really care that much since it's just my name, but it kinda makes me feel weird to see my own name next to a photo of Shuuichi and Kaori-san acting all lovey-dovey...


I read the article. It's all praise for the design.

％Ｂ
「Well, it's not like they'd criticize a reader's house... But still, these are some pretty nice photos.」

I'm not talking about the one with Shuuichi, but the ones of the house.
I've become able to tell good photos from bad when it comes to buildings, since I've had to take photos myself ever since I was working at Azuma-san's firm.


The photos here show off the house well.
They're accentuating the exact parts of the design that I took my time on.
％Ｂ
「That's a magazine cameraman for you. They know what they're doing.」
The photographer's name is written in the corner of the page.
"Photography: Segawa Natsuki"
％Ｂ
「...」
％Ｂ
「...Hmmmmhhhhh!?」
％Ｂ
「She's taking architecture photos too now?」
She's always taken photos of anything and everything, but I didn't think she'd even do stuff in my field.\n\r

I'll need to tell Sora about this later.
Later that night.
I'm going through my emails for the day when...
Sora
「...Ryou.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, you're here.」
Sora arrives at the office after work like always.
％Ｂ
「Hey, I got something interesting in the mail today. Let me show you―」

Sora
「...You have a guest.」
％Ｂ
「Wha... A guest?」
At this hour? That's rare.
And Sora brought them?
I wonder if it's a coworker from the museum who's here to talk about a remodeling job or something.
Sora
「...Can I have her come in?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, of course.」
Sora
「...Come inside.」
all
I tighten my necktie and prepare to welcome the guest.
Natsuki
「Hey there, long time no see! Looks like you're doing great!」
％Ｂ
「Wha... You... Segawa!?」
Natsuki
「Wow, so this is where you work? It's so classy!」
She eagerly starts looking all around the office, from the ceiling to the walls to the floor.
all
％Ｂ
「H-Hey, Sora... Why's Segawa here...?」
Sora
「...Because―」

Natsuki
「I'll explain. Oh, I want my coffee with no milk and two spoonfuls of sugar.」

％Ｂ
「Of course, right away.
Wait, I'm making you coffee?」
Natsuki
「Because I'm a guest, aren't I?」
％Ｂ
「...Oh... Yeah, that's true. All right, then.」
Sora
「...I'll do it. You sit.」
all
Natsuki
「You're so good at taking care of people. I heard on the way here, but you two aren't married yet, right?」


％Ｂ
「Yeah, that's right.」
Natsuki
「You're making her wait a long time, aren't you? Oh, but tell me when you're holding the ceremony. I'll be your cameraman♪」


all
The three of us start talking once Sora brings the coffee.
％Ｂ
「I saw the photos you took. I never would've thought you'd even do architectural photography.」


I lay out the magazine I got today on the table.
Natsuki
「Mmm... I joined Nishioka-sensei's studio right after graduating trade school and became her assistant. Oh, do you know Nishioka-sensei? She's a cameraman who has a studio in Shionagi.」


％Ｂ
「Nishioka-sensei, as in Nishioka Youko?」
Natsuki
「Oh, so you do know her. Have you met her?」
％Ｂ
「No, not directly, but we had her take photos of Teacher's work before in the past. I see, so you've been her assistant.」


Natsuki
「Oh yeah, now I remember she was talking about that too! Azuma Morio, right? She said she's known him for a while, and occasionally does work for him. Okay, okay, so he's your teacher.」


Sora
「...Small world.」
％Ｂ
「Seriously...」
Natsuki
「You're not wrong, Sora.」
％Ｂ
「So why are you here today? And why'd you show up with Sora?」

Natsuki
「Mhm, but before I talk about that, I have a gift for Sora.」
She pulls out an album folder from her bag and takes out a single photo.

Natsuki
「Here you go. It's a photo of the stars you love so much.」
Sora
「...Ohhh...」
It's a beautiful photo of a sky full of stars.
Sora
「...Where is this?」
Natsuki
「Okinawa!」
Sora
「...Okinawa...」
Sora's eyes are shining just as brightly as the stars in the photo.
all
％Ｂ
「You went to Okinawa? That sounds nice... For vacation?」
Natsuki
「Tch, tch, tch. For work, obviously. I'm a freelancer right now, so I'll go anywhere in Japan if there's a commission.」


％Ｂ
「That's really impressive. You're as light on your feet as ever.」
Natsuki
「What are you talking about? You're the impressive one here for becoming independent and setting up such a nice firm.」


％Ｂ
「We're both freelancers in a way. And you're way more impressive than I am if you're flying around all over Japan for your work.」


Natsuki
「Nooo, it's not that impressiiive. But I just sell myself as being able to take photos of anything, which means I haven't really found a good niche for myself yet.」


％Ｂ
「Hmmh, I guess there's a lot to being a cameraman.」
all
I guess it's not enough to just take good photos.
Well, photography's pretty much an art form, so I'm sure there's aspects of it that ordinary people can't understand.

Natsuki
「Now then, now then. So to get right to it, I have a request for you.」

％Ｂ
「Right, that's why you're here. You wanna talk about remodeling or something?」

Natsuki
「No, I want you to let me take photos of you.」
％Ｂ
「Huh? Photos of me? Why this again?」
I stare blankly at her. Segawa just points at the magazine on the table before her.

Natsuki
「You're the one who designed Nirasawa's house in this, right?」

％Ｂ
「Yeah... He commissioned me for it 'cause he said he wanted to have a house built before he got married. What about it?」

Natsuki
「This publishing company does a bunch of different magazines along the same lines. Architecture ones.」

％Ｂ
「I know about them. I pick up a few issues every now and then.」
Natsuki
「And so one of the editors there really took a liking to Nirasawa's house when they saw it. So they want to feature you, the designer, in something.」


％Ｂ
「Wha... Me?」
Natsuki
「Yup. And they'll need a photo for that, so I volunteered.」

Natsuki
「You're probably gonna get an email interview from the editors sometime today or tomorrow, so make sure you answer their questions.」

％Ｂ
「...Uh huh. I'm kinda shocked from how sudden this all is... Wait a second, don't they usually only take photos and stuff after the interviewee's agreed?」

Natsuki
「But you're not going to say no, right? So I came here first.」
％Ｂ
「You're just as forceful as ever.」
She hasn't changed at all since high school.
Though that's also reassuring to me.
Natsuki
「Okay, now that I've explained why, let's move on to the photo shoot!」

％Ｂ
「Wha... Photo shoot? Wait, we're gonna do it now? Don't you usually set stuff like this up with appointments and stuff?」


Natsuki
「But I'm going to Hokkaido tomorrow. Gotta take photos of Ezo red foxes out on snowy fields.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, but that's just you.」
Natsuki
「If I don't take the photos now, it's going to be a cameraman other than me who comes.」
％Ｂ
「I'm fine with that...」
Natsuki
「I'm not. Why do I have to let some stranger capture a friend's moment in the spotlight?」

％Ｂ
「Uh... I don't really have a counterargument if that's how you see it. All right. I'll leave it up to you then, Segawa.」

Natsuki
「Now we're talking! All right, let's get started already! Okay, now give me a smile!」

I try smiling at Segawa's camera.
Natsuki
「Aghh, it's too stiff. Give me a more natural one.」
％Ｂ
「L-Like this...? Hehe.」
Natsuki
「I said a natural smile.」
％Ｂ
「...That's what I was going for.」
Natsuki
「Sora, tickle him a bit.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「Wha... Wait, you're kidding, right? You don't have to do that toー
pffhahhah!」
Natsuki
「There we go, that's a good smile!」
％Ｂ
「Wait... Hold onー
fhahahahah!」
Natsuki
「That's top-notch stuff! It's a perfectly natural smile!」
No, this is definitely unnatural...!
all
Natsuki
「Whew, got a lot. I definitely took some good photos.」
％Ｂ
「I-I'm glad...」
It was a pretty rough photo shoot, what with being tickled by Sora and being forced to do crazy poses for Segawa.

Natsuki
「I'll be going, then. I'll come by again sometime.」
all
She waves and triumphantly leaves the office.
It kinda feels like after a storm's passed through.
Sora
「Want some tea?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, that'd be great.」
all
I lean back on the couch and exhale.
I watch Sora from behind as she makes tea in the kitchen.
％Ｂ
「You seem like you're in a good mood, Sora.」
Sora
「...*nod* It was fun getting to see Natsu again after so long. It was like we were back in high school.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah. Since she hasn't changed at all.」
Our memories of those times are treasures for us.
Knowing that things haven't changed since then makes me happy.
...The way I felt back in high school, huh...
％Ｂ
「...Hey, Sora. Do you remember?」
Sora
「...?」
％Ｂ
「The school Tanabata Festival back when I was a second year and you were a first year.」
Sora
「...*nod* I could never forget.」
％Ｂ
「That was a lot of fun, helping with the aquarium and making the planetarium with everyone.」
Sora
「It was.」
％Ｂ
「It's amazing that we were in a place where we could experience things like that every day.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
It was a place where we could enjoy ourselves learning.
％Ｂ
「It'd be fun if the new science museum was a place like that.」
Sora
「...That sounds really fun.」
She smiles and brings over the tea.
％Ｂ
「I think I've found it. A concept for the new science museum.」
