Post-hurricane weather is really something else.
There isn't a cloud in sight, and the air feels clearer.
％Ｂ
「I apologize. I hadn't even considered that.」
Misa
「Oh no, please do not let it trouble you. It's nothing you need to apologize for. And my father took me to school, which was very helpful.」
Okihara-senpai apparently came to school to watch over the fish tanks yesterday because she was worried that the equipment might stop working during a blackout.
But unlike the area around Rikka's place, there apparently wasn't a blackout over here.


Marika
「It's a good thing there wasn't much damage, even though we got hit directly by the hurricane.」
％Ｂ
「Seriously.」
all
It doesn't seem like there was any damage to the school buildings either. There's pretty much no sign the hurricane came through at all, if you ignore the broken tree branches littering the grounds.

Sora
「...Will we make it?」
％Ｂ
「We scheduled things so we'd have time left over, so there are no issues.」
all
Marika
「But everyone else seemed like they were in a hurry. I wonder if they'll be okay...」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, there are a decent number of groups with schedules that don't leave much room for error 'cause of manpower and circumstances.」

Marika
「I wish we could help, but we can't do that, can we?」
We don't have the time to help everyone who's in a bind right now.
If we help them, then our own display won't make it in time.
All we can do is pray for them to make it...
all
％Ｂ
「...Support, huh.」
％Ｂ
「Okay. This might be perfect timing.」
There's something I've been thinking about since last night.
Marika
「What's the matter?」
％Ｂ
「Could you guys hear me out real quick? There's something I want your help with.」

all
Shuuichi
「―And you want me to help with that too?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah.」
I'm asking Shuuichi for his cooperation.
I won't be able to pull this off without his help.
Shuuichi
「Come on... You know my position, don't you?」
％Ｂ
「You're the chairman of the event organization committee, right? That's why I'm asking you.」
Shuuichi
「What are you gonna do if they say no?」
％Ｂ
「I'll do it anyway.」
Shuuichi
「And who's gonna take responsibility?」
％Ｂ
「Guess I'll have to ask you to do that with me.」
Shuuichi
「Hah! Hahaha! You never change. I would've punched you in the face if you said you were going to take responsibility by yourself.」

Shuuichi
「But you really like Narusawa, don't you...」
％Ｂ
「You'd do something similar for Kaori-san, wouldn't you?」
Shuuichi
「Of course I would. I'd pull off something so grand and cunning, it'd even make a ref take back a red card.」

all
Rikka
「Sorry to make you wait. Why did you ask me to come here? I still have work to do, so I can't stay too long...」

I've been waiting for Rikka. I told her to come once she had some time between things to do at work.

％Ｂ
「Don't worry, this'll be quick. If you say okay, at least.」
Rikka
「If I say okay? What did you want to talk about?」
％Ｂ
「I want you to play the piano.」
Rikka
「The piano...」
％Ｂ
「Maaan～ So the thing is. I'm totally beat 'cause I've just been doing nothing but heavy lifting all day.」

％Ｂ
「You know how music therapy's a thing, right? I suddenly wanted to listen to you play piano.」

％Ｂ
「I'll be able to work hard if you play for me. So please!」

I clap my hands together.
Rikka
「Sigh... Is that all? I thought it was something more important because you suddenly wanted to talk.」

Rikka
「Hehe. Geez, fine. I don't have much time, so just one piece.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, that's more than enough.」
Rikka
「Any requests?」
％Ｂ
「I wanna hear "A Fragment of Emotion."」
Rikka
「"A Fragment of Emotion"...」
She stares down at the piano.
She's probably thinking about Meguru-chan's performance from the other day.
Rikka
「It can't be a different one?」
％Ｂ
「I really like that piece. Maybe it's 'cause I've been hearing it since I was a kid. Always find myself humming it when it's around Tanabata.」

Rikka
「I've never heard you say you like "A Fragment of Emotion."」
％Ｂ
「You haven't?」
Rikka
「...You aren't planning something strange, are you?」
Kh... That's Rikka for you.
She's pretty sharp.
But I won't allow my plan to fail here.
％Ｂ
「...You got me. I am.」
I fess up.
If I denied it, then I think it'd just make Rikka suspicious.
So then I should just take her mind off it another way.
％Ｂ
「I was actually thinking of doing something dirty.」
Rikka
「Wha...?」
％Ｂ
「Like about how you'd react if I rubbed your boobs or something from behind while you were playing.」

Rikka
「～～～～! You wouldn't get away with just a slap on the cheek if you did that!」

％Ｂ
「Mhm. I figured, so I decided to not do that earlier.」
％Ｂ
「I won't rub them, so could you please play "A Fragment of Emotion"?」
Rikka
「...Sigh... You better not rub them. I might even start considering breaking up if you do.」

％Ｂ
「Haha!」
I can't help but laugh from how happy I am.
Because she hates having her piano playing ruined.
Because that means she loves playing the piano.
Rikka
「What are you laughing for?」
％Ｂ
「No, nothing. Sure, let's break up if I rub your boobs while you're playing.」
％Ｂ
「But I'll never do that. Ever.」
Rikka
「Okay. Close the door, then.」
She must not want anyone else to hear.
all
I do as she says and close the door.
This works better for me anyway.
I stick my hand in my pocket.
I tap on the phone number I made sure to have up beforehand on the screen to start a call.
％Ｂ
「It's closed.」
Rikka nods, opens the piano's lid, and uncovers the keys.
She silently sits on the bench.
Rikka
「...」
She closes her eyes.
I wonder what she's thinking right now.
She exhales once, letting all the tension out of her body.
She places her fingers lightly against the keys...
And I turn on the equipment that I had hidden earlier―
Her fingers dance left and right across the keys.
Her feet press rhythmically on the pedals.
The pleasant melody immediately starts seeping through my body.
I'm struck by the urge to hum along.
I force the urge down.
Rikka just looks like she's having so much fun.
I can hardly believe this is the same person from yesterday.
I can't tell if it's because of the power of the piano, or if it's because of her intense focus.
Maybe it's from the sense of comfort that it's just us two here, or maybe it's because I asked her to play for me.

That may be conceited of me to think, but I don't care.
The only thing that matters to me right now is her smile, right before my eyes.
％Ｂ
「...」
I might be about to destroy this smile.
Rikka might get angry at me.
She might hate me.
She might want to break up with me.
I understand that what I'm doing is just that terrible.
But...
If I can get Rikka to approve of her own piano playing, even if it's only a little...
If I can get her to like her own piano playing...
I'll do anything.
A gentle reverberation lingers after she finishes her performance.
Rikka
「Was this enough to get you motivated?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. I'm full of energy now. Thanks.」
Rikka
「Hehehe. I'm glad.」
My phone buzzes to tell me I have a message.
It's from my accomplices.
My good friends who gladly agreed to take on this crime with me.
％Ｂ
「There's something I want you to see, Rikka.」
Rikka
「What is it?」
％Ｂ
「Shinozaki just sent me this video.」
Rikka
「Shinozaki-san? Is it okay for me to see this?」
％Ｂ
「There's no point if you don't.」
I play the video.
Marika
『Oh... It's started... Um... Oh. This is Shinozaki, from class 2-D!』

Rikka
「Wha...?」
She stumbles around a little, and then affects a reporter-like cadence.
The video depicts students preparing for the Tanabata Festival in a classroom.
And the speakers are broadcasting "A Fragment of Emotion"... It's Rikka's performance from just now.

％Ｂ
「Sorry to do this without telling you. We were broadcasting your performance throughout the school just now.」

This is why I needed the help of Shinozaki and the others, the broadcast club, and Shuuichi's authority as the chairman of the event organization committee.
My idea was the "let's soothe the students who are tired from Tanabata Festival preparations project."

The plan was to have Rikka's piano playing brighten everyone's day.

There's no way this plan would've been accepted by the teachers normally, but we were able to convince them to let us do it with the chairman of the event organization committee taking responsibility for it.
And of course, that was just a pretense...
Rikka
「...」
Rikka's staring intently at the video.
Second-Year Girl C
『Marikaaa. Why are you taking a video? Oh, does this have something to do with this song that started playing?』

Marika
『Mhm. What do you think?』
Marika
『This is actually a live performance from a certain student from our school.』
Second-Year Girl C
『No way!? This is sooo good! What? What!? Who's playing this!?』

Marika
『It's Narusawa-san. She's playing it to cheer you guys up when you're tired.』

Second-Year Girl C
『Wow, Narusawa-san? I always thought she was kiiinda hard to approach, but she's a nice person, isn't she? Mhm, I think I'm feeling a lot better.』

Second-Year Girl C
『Hey everyone! Let's do our best and make this haunted house!!』
Second-Years
『Yeaaaaahh!!』
Marika
『That's all from me～ Narusawa-san, I love your piano playing too!』

Misa
『Hello. This is Okihara Misa! There are many people working here today in the third-year hallway.』

Third-Year Boy A
『Aghhh, who is it broadcasting music when we're this busy!?』

Third-Year Girl A
『But don't you think it's really nice?』
Third-Year Boy A
『Of course it's nice, it's "A Fragment of Emotion!"』
Third-Year Girl A
『I don't mean it like that. Don't you think it sounds really gentle?』
Third-Year Boy A
『Gentle... Hm, now that you mention it, I think I can hear that, yeah.』

Third-Year Girl A
『You're so uncultured.』
Third-Year Boy A
『What'd you say!?』
Misa
『Ufufu. They must be quite close to have these sorts of arguments, don't you think?』
Misa
『Everyone seems very happy. My heart also always dances with excitement when I hear your piano playing, Rikka-san.』

Misa
『So hearing you say that your piano playing is worthless saddens me too.』
Misa
『Your sound is very beautiful, Rikka-san!』
Touko
『Fuaaahh～ ...Hafh.』
Touko
『Piano-chan's piano playing's so nice～ ...It lets me sleep so comfortably～』

％Ｂ
「...What's the point of showing you being soothed?」
Though I guess that's fine.
Touko
『You see, Piano-chan. I like wandering around on my days off. I like to just kinda stare out at the sea. I like feeding stray cats and playing with them.』


Touko
『I do those things all the time because I like to do them. Do you think there isn't any meaning behind that? Why do you play piano every day, Piano-chan?』


Rikka
「...」
Touko
『If you like it, it's fun. If it's fun, you like it. I think your piano playing's a lot of fun.』

Touko
『Because it gets me so sleepy... Fuaaah～ ...Niiight～』

Natsuki
『I like it, I like iiit～ It's just got this "a page from the book of the golden years of our youth" feel to it～!』
Natsuki
『Mmm～ ...Holding up my camera's kinda hard while I'm holding my phone... Sorry, just a second.』

The video feed suddenly zooms in on her uniform, and then it goes black.
Looks like she put her phone in her skirt pocket.
We hear several clicks of the shutter.
Natsuki
『Hup... Rikka, can you see this? Don't you think it's amazing?』
The video shows the brass band club practicing.
％Ｂ
「...They're playing along with your piano playing?」
It's a spontaneous jam session.
It's just a few performers at first, but more and more people show up.
Before we know it, they're all lined up, enjoying themselves playing trumpets and trombones.

Natsuki
『I was looking for a good spot to record when I heard them playing in the courtyard. Can you believe my luck?』
Natsuki
『I'm total garbage at playing instruments, but I kinda get how they feel. It's like how hearing a nice tune makes you wanna hum along, uh...』


Natsuki
『Aaghhh geez! This is way too much beating around the bush for me!』
Segawa focuses the camera on her face.
Natsuki
『Listen up, Rikka! I'll be honest! I don't really care if you think your piano playing has value or not, which pretty much means I don't care if you play the piano or not!』

Natsuki
『You're still Rikka either way! You're my friend!』
Rikka
「Segawa-san...」
Natsuki
『But you see... There's this idiot that loves you a freaking ton who's doing everything he can for you!』

Natsuki
『You're free to make whatever choice you want. But you should at least understand that. That's all!』

Sora
『...Not good. No one's here.』
The video feed tilts. Maybe she's tilting her head.
Sora
『The rooftop's off limits.』
Sora
『I forgot because we all went up recently... But the door was unlocked...?』

Dance Club Faculty Adviser
『Well if it isn't Ousaka. Doing some club activities up here?』
Seems like it's a teacher she knows.
Sora
『...*nod* What about you?』
Dance Club Faculty Adviser
『It's almost the Tanabata Festival, right? The dance club that I'm in charge of is supposed to be rehearsing as a group today, so I'm up here to watch them.』


Dance Club Faculty Adviser
『And something great's happened.』
Sora
『...?』
Dance Club Faculty Adviser
『Here. Look down at the grounds.』
Sora
『Ohhh... Pretty...』
Dance Club Faculty Adviser
『Right? I've been worried because this routine hasn't been successful even once up until now. But unfortunately, they're so focused right now they can't seem to hear me.』

Dance Club Faculty Adviser
『Looks like I'll just have to wait and let them do what they want. But... Hup. Phew... That sounds nice. It's perfect for a break.』


Sora
『...Old man.』
Dance Club Faculty Adviser
『Now that's just mean～ I'm still only in my thirties, you know. How about you take a break here too, Ousaka?』

Sora
『...*nod* Ritsu's piano calms me down. It makes me like the stars more.』

Dance Club Faculty Adviser
『By the way. That thing on your phone. Is that Saturn?』

Sora
『...It's a proof of friendship.』
...That's right.
We've been catching glimpses of everyone's planet phone straps throughout everyone's video feeds so far.

It's the proof of our friendship.
％Ｂ
「There's one more thing I have to apologize for. I told them about you and Meguru-chan without your permission to get them to help me.」

％Ｂ
「I know what I did was wrong. I'm really sorry!」
I straighten my back and lower my head.
％Ｂ
「But... your piano playing can make people smile this much.」
％Ｂ
「You couldn't possibly call this worthless!」
Rikka
「...Raise your head.」
If she slaps me, then that's just fine.
I steel myself and raise my head.
Rikka
「You're so stupid... Why would you do something like this...?」
She's crying.
Tears are streaming down her face.
Her wet eyes reflect my apologetic expression.
She isn't doing anything to wipe her tears away.
She sobs quietly.
Rikka
「All of you... are just so unfair... hgh!」
Rikka
「Why are you all so nice? ...Why do you care so much about me...?」
Rikka knows the answer to that question.
She knows, but she's still asking.
If putting it into words will dispel her doubts...
Then I have to tell her.
％Ｂ
「It's because we all love you, Rikka. We love you so much we barely even know what to do with ourselves.」

％Ｂ
「We might all have our own ways of thinking, but we all think you're precious.」
％Ｂ
「I'm not you. I don't have any talented siblings or anything. I don't think I can genuinely understand you.」

％Ｂ
「I don't have any knowledge or talent when it comes to music, so I can't give you any advice like a judge could.」

Rikka
「...」
％Ｂ
「But there are some things I do know.」
％Ｂ
「I know that all of your efforts up until now have meaning.」
％Ｂ
「I know that there's emotion packed into all of that piano playing you love to do.」
％Ｂ
「I know that even if you think you're inferior to Meguru-chan, your playing still has value.」
％Ｂ
「We all know, even if you don't acknowledge it―」
％Ｂ
「I'll acknowledge all of it.」
Rikka
「...Gh, aah... U-Uuuaahh... Aaaahhhh....!」
Beautiful droplets roll down her cheeks.
Those were the words that she could never have anyone say to her.
Everyone around her was a first-rate musician. Even if they did mean those words, they would have only been consolation to her.

...Because she couldn't be successful like they were.
Rikka
「I'm... so glad... that I met Segawa-san... and Shinozaki-san... and Okihara-senpai...」

Rikka
「And Ousaka-san... and Yukimura-san... and Nirasawa-kun...」

Rikka
「I'm so glad... I met you...!」
％Ｂ
「Yeah.」
Rikka
「I've... always regretted... saying no to Meguru when she asked me to enter in contests...!」

Rikka
「I couldn't do anything... I knew it wasn't Meguru's fault! It's just that I didn't have the strength!」
Rikka
「I was afraid of being shown the difference in our talent... Even though I knew that wasn't what Meguru intended!」

Rikka
「But... I've been acknowledged! You've... acknowledged someone like me...! Everyone's supporting me... and I made lots of people smile...!」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. Everyone's acknowledged you, Rikka.」
Rikka
「I... want to play...! I want to smile and play with Meguru again...!」

％Ｂ
「Let's tell Meguru-chan how you feel. I'm sure she'll be happy.」

Rikka
「Mhm...」
I wipe away the jewellike tears from her eyes.
I run my fingers through the black silk of her hair, glimmering in the light of sunset. I can sense her breathing calming down.

A moment of calm.
％Ｂ
「Still, though...」
Rikka
「Sniff... What?」
％Ｂ
「You really are a crybaby, aren't you?」
Rikka
「...Hgh. You're the one who's always making me cry. Geez... I'm only a crybaby because you're a bully...」

％Ｂ
「Oh. Haha, so I'm a bully. I had no idea!」
Rikka
「What a terrible boyfriend... Hehe. But I'm okay with crying tears like these. So... make sure you only make me cry this much, okay?」


％Ｂ
「That's been my intention from the start.」
Rikka
「Hehe... My face might swell up from all this crying.」
％Ｂ
「That's fine. You'll still be the Rikka I love.」
Rikka
「I don't know how I'd feel about that. It's like you're saying there's no point in all the effort I put into being pretty for you...」


％Ｂ
「Then please be pretty and cute for my sake.」
Rikka
「You've even added on "cute." What a demanding boyfriend I have, hehe.」
Her expression's as clear as the weather after a hurricane.
...I guess it'd be fine for me to be Rikka's personal bully.
As long as I get to see her face like this.
