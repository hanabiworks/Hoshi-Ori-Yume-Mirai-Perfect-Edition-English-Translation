「...」
Today's the day they announce the results for the second-class architect subject exam.
I can look up whether I failed or passed online. I nervously start up my browser.

Touko
「How'd you do? Did you pass?」
％Ｂ
「Hold on, it's still loading... Oh, there it is!」

The page with the ID numbers of everyone who passed comes up.
I look for my number.
％Ｂ
「...I found it! I found my number! I passed the subject exam!」

Touko
「That's great! Congratulations!」
My anxiety melts away and I celebrate with Touko.
I was pretty sure I had done well, but I couldn't be completely comfortable until I got to see the actual result like this.

％Ｂ
「Ahh... Now I can focus on preparing for the drafting exam without any worries.」
Touko
「Don't forget to help me with my studying too, okay? I'm finally able to understand what the workbooks say now.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, I know. Oh yeah, speaking of which, did you apply for the exam yet? The deadline's soon, right?」

Touko
「Mhm, I did it the other day. I was considering applying for a one-stage-only exam type, but I decided on the standard type that lets you do a second stage too. The cost wasn't that much different either.」


％Ｂ
「Sounds good. And you might end up passing in the first stage anyway.」
Touko
「I'd be a genius if I passed on the first try, right? Maybe I have natural talent for this.」

％Ｂ
「You can say stuff like that after you pass the first stage. You'll never pass just on luck alone, even if it is a machine-graded exam.」


Touko
「Okaaay. Then I think I'll do my best so I can annoy my tutor as much as possible.」

...The hell's with that motive?
She really has been putting a lot of effort into studying lately... Is that seriously the reason why?
