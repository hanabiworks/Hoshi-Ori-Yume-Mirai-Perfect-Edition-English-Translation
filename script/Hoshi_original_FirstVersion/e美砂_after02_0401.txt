Azuma
「I am Azuma Morio, from the Azuma Morio Architectural Firm.」
％Ｂ
「I am ％Ａ ％Ｂ, likewise an architect from the same firm.」
Misa
「And I am Okihara Misa, a curator at the Shionagi marine science museum, "Marinpia Shionagi."」

We all trade business cards in Marinpia Shionagi.

The title under Misa's name on her business card is especially meaningful.
That's right. She decided to leave her position as a junior research fellow at the university, to work here at Marinpia.

Azuma
「Pleased to make your acquaintance... but that's not exactly true. We've met once before, a long time ago.」

Misa
「Yes. You came to our Tanabata Festival display at Shionagi First Academy back when we were students.」


Azuma
「I remember I was surprised when you suddenly started talking to Arita about your dream of reopening Marinpia.」

Azuma
「I would like to congratulate you from the bottom of my heart that your dream has come true.」
Misa
「Thank you very much. It makes me truly happy to hear that from the one who designed this building.」


Azuma
「And so your father was not reappointed as director?」
Misa
「He was asked to by the city... but he declined, saying that he had to take responsibility for the previous failure.」

Azuma
「That's quite the shame...」
Misa
「My father is getting on in his years, and he would like to live according to his own interests. He currently spends 360 days a year immersed in research in the Pacific Ocean.」

Misa
「We will do our part, as well as my father's share, to build up Marinpia. We would be incredibly grateful if we could rely on your assistance.」


She bows her head low.
She seems so mature when she's in work mode.

Misa
「Now then, I would like to provide a simple outline for Marinpia Shionagi's reopening.」

Misa
「When Marinpia resumes operation, its management will not be handled directly by the city. Instead, we have publicly indicated that we would like to have specific designated organizations take care of that role.」


Misa
「As a result, the Miyatetsu Express and Mutual Prosperity Home companies have been decided to manage the institution.」

Misa
「Both parties have provided words of goodwill promising a significant degree of support and passion.」

Azuma
「I see. So that's the way you're reorganizing things this time around.」
Misa
「Yes. Marinpia Shionagi will be the same from outside eyes... but we will be using this opportunity to reinvent the internal workings of the institution.」


Her expression changes.
Misa
「We are not aiming for a simple reopening. Our goal is to provide all guests with a sense of wonder that can only be experienced at Marinpia Shionagi.」


Misa
「And so we would also like to change our displays, so as to offer novel and yet-unheard-of surprises.」

Novel and yet-unheard-of surprises.
An aquarium like that would be a big deal.
And Misa's genuinely trying to bring that about.
I can tell from her expression that she's utterly serious about this.
I'm starting to get pumped too!
Misa
「We would like to borrow your expertise as the one who designed this building on the subject of these changes. There would be no one more suited for this.」


Misa
「May we depend on your aid?」
Azuma
「Yes―」
％Ｂ
「Yes, of course!」

Azuma
「Wait, why are you answering?」
％Ｂ
「Oh... I'm sorry, I just...」
Azuma
「Honestly... I will help you as best as I am able, of course. In fact, you didn't even need to ask.」

Azuma
「As you already know, we unfortunately lost in the Hokuou University competition last year.」

Azuma
「It may be strange to phrase it this way... but our firm, myself included, is quite motivated for this project after that defeat. He's a good example of that.」


％Ｂ
「Auh...」
Misa
「Ufufu, it seems so.」
Azuma
「We appreciate you choosing our firm for your renovations. We swear to do work that will live up to... no, surpass your expectations.」

Misa
「Thank you very much. Hearing you say that puts us very much at ease. Now then, let us get started and summarize our current situation.」


all
She starts placing several documents on the table.
Misa
「First, I would like to discuss the realizability and budget for our plan.」

Azuma
「Let's see.」
Azuma-san starts reading through the documents intently.
It's been eight months since we lost the competition...
We've finally got an opportunity for revenge with a big contract.
all
I know Azuma-san already said it, but we've definitely gotta put our all into this, and do work that's above all expectations.

Azuma
「Then we will take the current plans back with us to consider them.」

Misa
「Please do.」
all
Time flies. It's just about night by the time our meeting's over.
Azuma
「Now then, I'm gonna go back to the office. You don't have to come back with me.」

％Ｂ
「But...」
Azuma
「It's late. Go eat dinner with your girlfriend or something.」
％Ｂ
「Uh... Wait, what?」
Wait a second, does Azuma-san know that Misa and I are dating?

Azuma
「What, you think I didn't know? You two've been dating since high school, haven't you?」

％Ｂ
「Y-You even know that?」
Azuma
「You've had hearts in your eyes whenever you looked at Okihara-san all the way back since the Tanabata Festival.」

％Ｂ
「Wha... Seriously!?」
Azuma
「I'm kidding. Arita told me.」
％Ｂ
「O-Oh... I see...」
Azuma
「Things are gonna get busy soon. You should treasure your time together.」

％Ｂ
「Yes... Thank you very much.」
Azuma
「Now then, I will be leaving. I look forward to working with you from now on, Okihara-san.」


Misa
「Likewise, I look forward to working with you.」
I look up at Marinpia's exterior after leaving.
％Ｂ
「...It's really gonna reopen.」
Misa
「It seems like it's been such a long time... but it also seems like it all passed in the blink of an eye.」

％Ｂ
「You decided you wanted to reopen Marinpia the same year we first met, right? So that means it's already been nine years.」


Misa
「...It's making me rather emotional.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, you can really appreciate all the hard work you've done for the last nine years. You're amazing, Misa.」

Misa
「This is all because I had you supporting me too. I hope that we can continue to have an excellent relationship, for many, many years to come.」

％Ｂ
「Hahaha... Then, I likewise hope we'll get along.」
We smile after the stiff formalities.
％Ｂ
「You've grown up, Misa.」
Misa
「What? ...What do you mean by that?」
％Ｂ
「You used to suddenly hug people when you got happy... but you've stopped doing stuff like that.」

Misa
「A-Ahaha～ ...The hugging... I made myself stop doing that, out of consideration. It wouldn't be polite, here in the real world.」


％Ｂ
「So you were being considerate.」
Misa
「Yes. I've been holding it all in.」
％Ｂ
「Really... But you know...」
％Ｂ
「I think... it'd be okay to act according to your emotions and hug people every now and then.」

Misa
「What...?」
％Ｂ
「I think it'd be good to show your happiness that way sometimes. It's more like you anyway.」

Misa
「Do you think so? Well then, if you say so...」
She glances around to see if anyone's around, and...
Misa
「We did it!」
She suddenly squeezes me tight.
％Ｂ
「Ooohhh...」
Misa
「We did it! We did iiit! Marinpia Shionagi is reopening! It just feels so genuinely wonderful!」


％Ｂ
「That's great, Misa.」
Misa
「Ahahahahaha! Kyaaah!」

all
I hug her tight and swing her around.
I feel like we've gone back to when we were students.
Misa
「Cheeers!」
I invited Misa over.
We're eating dinner around the table together.
％Ｂ
「I probably should have gotten reservations at a restaurant... but I felt like cooking at home today.」

Misa
「I'm very happy for that. And... Ahhh～ This drink is very delicious. It has a very curious flavor that I haven't had before.」


％Ｂ
「That's a spirit called aquavit. I tried mixing it with club soda.」

Misa
「What a wonderful name!」
％Ｂ
「It's apparently a popular Scandinavian spirit. It's distilled from potatoes, and its name means "water of life."」

Misa
「It's as if this was made for me...」
％Ｂ
「I found it and bought it a while back, and figured we could drink it on a special occasion.」

Misa
「I think today is the perfect day to have it!」
The new flavor only serves to get us in a better mood.
We can't really stop ourselves from drinking and drinking.
％Ｂ
「And so anyway, I tried making something with potatoes in it as the appetizer. I think it'll go well with the aquavit. And the main dish is...」


Misa
「...What could it be?」
％Ｂ
「This!」
I slide a plate forward.
Though it was already right in front of me. I was just pretending it wasn't anything worth paying attention to.

Misa
「Woooow!」
％Ｂ
「Japanese-style napolitan spaghetti, with octopus-shaped sausage!」
Misa
「They're so cute～! It looks very delicious!」

％Ｂ
「I tried putting my own spin on the Japanese-style napolitan you love. As you can see, I took the time to make each of the little sausages into an octopus.」

Misa
「This is incredible! They even have faces and mouths! Oh, there are crabs too!」

％Ｂ
「I can't skimp on the details if I want your seal of approval. Anyway, eat up.」

Misa
「Okay～ I'm very excited! I'm very curious to see how it tastes～」

She's been bouncing up and down since I revealed the dish.
She's staring at me with anticipation in her eyes, her fork on the table before her.

％Ｂ
「...Okay. Enjoy.」
I twist some pasta around my fork and carefully extend it toward her mouth.
Misa
「Oh? My, the food is approaching me!」
％Ｂ
「Today's a special day, after all.」
Misa
「Perhaps the octopuses are celebrating for me... Nh, mh... mgmgh...」

Misa
「It's delicious! Its flavoring is very deep, like the ocean!」
％Ｂ
「It might look kiddy, but it tastes mature, right? I put anchovy in it too, so it should go well with the alcohol.」

Misa
「Yes, it's very delicious... Oh no!」
Misa
「It appears I got a little sauce on my lips...」
％Ｂ
「We both know it was on purpose... Honestly.」
Misa
「Mmmh... Chu...」
％Ｂ
「Nh, slrp... Mmchu...」
％Ｂ
「Oh, you're right. This tastes amazing.」
Misa
「Doesn't it!?」
Misa
「Oh, then I will repay the favor! Here, "ahhh"...!」

％Ｂ
「Yes, yes. Thanks, Misa.」
Misa
「Don't thank me, thank the octopuses. This is all thanks to their hard work.」

％Ｂ
「Amhamh... Mhm, it tastes good. Though I got some sauce on my lip.」

Misa
「Then, nnhh... chu...」
％Ｂ
「Mh... mlh...」
Misa
「E-Eheheheheh... It really is delicious... Now then, if I drink some of this now... Nkh, nkh...」

Misa
「Oh my... This may just make me melt...」
％Ｂ
「You look crazy happy right now, Misa.」
Misa
「Of course I do. I'm very much in bliss right now. I would like to be spoiled lots today.」

％Ｂ
「Sure. Tell me what you want.」
Misa
「Then... may I have you kiss me a little more?」

％Ｂ
「Even though there's no sauce on your lips?」
Misa
「No, there is not... but I just want you to.」

％Ｂ
「Then here... Come a little closer.」
Misa
「Okaaay...」
She shuffles over to me.
I hold her tight.
Misa
「Nh, chu... Slrp... Mmchuuu... mmlh...」
And we exchange a deep kiss.
％Ｂ
「Nh, pfah...」
Misa
「Ufufufufu...」
Misa
「Oh my, I didn't think kissing would go quite so well with alcohol...」

She brings her glass up to her lips again.
Misa
「I feel very blessed right now. Is it okay for one to have a day this happy? The aquarium is reopening, and what's more, the two of us are working together...」


％Ｂ
「What are you talking about? It's only gonna get better from here. Let's build the aquarium up... together. Make it even better than before.」


Misa
「Yes! I... will definitely recreate the Marinpia of the future that you showed me that day!」


％Ｂ
「Yeah! Let's do it!」
We look intently into each other's eyes.
We make our vow loud and proud.
Misa
「...And if so...」
％Ｂ
「What's up?」
Misa
「This octopus napolitan may be perfect for the aquarium's cafe. The previous Marinpia only had normal menu options for lunch.」


％Ｂ
「I see, yeah, that's true... People spend lots of time in aquariums. They'd wanna take breaks, of course, and they'd get hungry too.」


％Ｂ
「And then once they go eat, there's a bit of a unique meal... That's good.」
Misa
「Isn't it? I think it's a very wonderful idea!」
％Ｂ
「Some dessert would be great too. Like, something that's got an aquarium or marine wildlife theme to it...」

Misa
「How very cute! I'm sure the guests would love to eat that!」
％Ｂ
「And souvenirs too... You could make bread and cookies that look like the animals in an aquarium... Here, let's try drawing it...」


all
I grab a sketchbook from my shelf and start sketching something out.

％Ｂ
「Hmm... Maybe a bit too realistic?」
Misa
「I think they're cute this way! And it would certainly be a talking point too.」

％Ｂ
「Y-You think so?」
％Ｂ
「Then we might as well make it about as big as the real thing...」
Misa
「Every version is more wonderful than the last!」
The two of us get more and more into it.
We keep talking until the time for the last bus home comes.
