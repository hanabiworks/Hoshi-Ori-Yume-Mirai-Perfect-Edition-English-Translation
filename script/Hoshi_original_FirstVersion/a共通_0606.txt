Marika
「C-Come in～」
Marika
「W-Wait just a second.」
Shinozaki was standing there in front of the mirror, still in her pajamas.
She frantically got back on top of the bed, brushing her hair as she went.
Marika
「Th-Thanks for waiting.」
It was funny how she said it so calmly even though I just saw her running around.
I couldn't help but laugh.
Marika
「Huh? Is there something weird about me～? Is my hair standing up?」

％Ｂ
「No, it isn't. I'm just glad that you're feeling better than I expected.」

Marika
「Y-Yeah. I'm doing great today!」
She stuck her chest out, oblivious to my teasing.
That was funny to me too, but I was also really happy that she's doing well.

％Ｂ
「Oh, here are today's printouts. I'm pretty proud of my work today.」

I proudly held out the stack of printouts.
Shinozaki accepted them, beaming.
Marika
「Thanks for always delivering them. I'm looking forward to it～」

％Ｂ
「Aren't you gonna look?」
Marika
「Yeah, I'll take my time later.」
％Ｂ
「It's the same either way, right?」
Marika
「It's completely different～ And it's embarrassing looking at them in front of you.」

％Ｂ
「What the heck? You're so weird.」
Marika
「I'm fine being weird...」
She held the printouts close to her chest.
I felt a little embarrassed at the way she was acting.
％Ｂ
「Oh, and they decided on the song for the chorus concert. It's gonna be "The Day You Leave."」

We had a chorus concert at the end of the first semester.
We today decided what song we'd be singing.
Marika
「"The Day You Leave"? It's a goodbye song?」

％Ｂ
「Yeah. 'Cause you know, I'm transferring. So that's why.」

Marika
「Oh... Right...」
Her expression immediately clouded over.
I'd known for a while now that I was going to be transferring out, so I already told Shinozaki about it.

But seeing Shinozaki make that face made me feel kinda guilty.

％Ｂ
「You don't have to make a big deal out of it. Or else you'll make me feel weird.」

Marika
「But I want to sing too. I want to be there to see you off properly too

, Hino-kun

.」
She seemed unusually determined.
％Ｂ
「But you can't sing, can you?」
She could apparently sing a bit, but her intense asthma made it so she had to stop right away.

I was pretty sure she didn't participate in music class because it's a trigger for asthma attacks.\n\r

That's why I had never heard Shinozaki sing.
Marika
「But I want to do something. You're always doing things for me, so at the end I at least wanted to...」

％Ｂ
「It's not like that'll be the last time we see each other. I'll still be around during the summer.」

I made my tone cheerful on purpose to try to get her to feel better, but she still looked glum.
I couldn't help but feel like I was responsible for making her feel sad.
％Ｂ
「Oh, I know. You know Kobayashi-sensei, the science teacher? She says we're going to go see the Perseid meteor shower over the summer.」


％Ｂ
「She said the stars are going to come falling down like a shower.」
Marika
「Like a shower? Really～? Kobayashi-sensei always makes such a big deal out of everything. But that sounds fun.」


％Ｂ
「Right? Why don't you do that, then? There's still a little time until then, so you can work on getting better while you wait.」

Marika
「...Yeah, that's true. And I'd be a bother if I made them let me sing.」

％Ｂ
「I didn't mean it like that...」
Marika
「No, it's okay. I wanna see the shooting stars～ I wonder if they'll really come falling down.」


She looked up out the window, as if looking for shooting stars.
Though it was still bright out, so of course there was no way there would be any.
％Ｂ
「Oh, I know. Let's make a wish on one of these, then.」

I pulled out a stack of tanzaku from my backpack.
Marika
「Are those tanzaku? There's so many～」

％Ｂ
「We got them at school today. I got lots of them for you too.」

Marika
「Oh really? Thanks. But this is way too much～ Do you really have this many wishes?」


She giggled.
I was relieved to see her finally smile.
％Ｂ
「What are you saying? You're gonna make the wishes.」

Marika
「Huh? These are all mine? I don't know if I have that many wishes.」

％Ｂ
「You have lots, don't you? Like, "I want ground meat steak for dinner tonight."」

Marika
「You don't make wishes like that on stars～ Ahaha, that's so funny.」

I could feel my heart lighten when she smiled.
That was when I had the thought. I wanted to make Shinozaki smile as much as I could before I left this town.

％Ｂ
「Let's start with the meteor shower first. "I wish I could see shooting stars."」

Marika
「Isn't it weird to wish on the stars about stars? Will it come true?」

％Ｂ
「Whatever, just write everything that you think of. I'll bring bamboo tomorrow, so let's put them up in this room.」

Marika
「Okay. Thanks! I'll write lots of wishes then.」

Shinozaki never really wanted for much, so she was complaining the whole time while I poked and prodded her to write out her wishes.

I wonder how many of those wishes we were able to make come true.

$$smh_OpenCHK
Shuuichi
「Now then, I'd like to begin today's event committee meeting.」
Shuuichi
「Starting today, there will be some new members joining our committee.」

Shuuichi
「
Shinozaki Marika-san from class 2-A, and Hino Ryousuke-kun from class 2-C. 

Let's all clap to welcome them!」
all
Shinozaki and I stand up after being introduced by Shuuichi and bow.
％Ｂ
「I'm ％Ａ ％Ｂ, from class 2-C. I only just transferred into this school, and have not experienced this school's Tanabata Festival yet.」


％Ｂ
「I used to live in Shionagi previously, but that was back in elementary school, so I don't actually have many memories of the city's Tanabata Festival.」

％Ｂ
「But, perhaps because of that, I've decided to join the event committee in order to create new memories for Tanabata. Thank you very much.」


Marika
「I'm Shinozaki Marika, from class 2-A. Um, I remember having a lot of fun experiencing the school's Tanabata Festival for the first time last year.」


Marika
「I have decided to participate in the event committee this year, so that I can be on the side that helps make the festival more fun. I'll do my best not to get in your way.」


Natsuki
「You two sure are tense.」
％Ｂ
「It-It's fine, isn't it? We're nervous.」
Marika
「Ahaha～」
Segawa's holding her camera up, apparently seeing this as a perfect photo opportunity for the graduation album.

Shuuichi
「And so, the two of them are genuinely motivated. They're truly dependable, saying they'll go out and buy anything for us! No matter how menial the task may be, once they're on the case...」


％Ｂ
「Hey. We didn't say all that.」
Shuuichi
「And so please give them another round of applause～!」
The room fills with cheers once Shuuichi starts clapping again.
Seems like he's the moodmaker around here as well.
Shuuichi
「Okay then. Now that we've gotten some dependable new members, let's move the topic to the very Tanabata Festival that they're so excited for.」

all
I thought this meeting would be pretty casual, but it's unexpectedly tense.

There are only two months until the Tanabata Festival.
There's no time to be messing around.
Everyone's serious about making this fun for all parties involved.
Shuuichi
「Now then. Please look at the documents before you. All of our roles for this year's festival are listed on the last page.」

Shuuichi
「I'll be in charge of administration. Shimizu-senpai is in charge of budget. Publicity will be―」


Shuuichi goes through the list of roles.
Shuuichi
「And we weren't able to amend the documents in time, so it isn't written there...」

Shuuichi
「But the two new members will be supporting this year's nonparticipant clubs.」

Event Committee Member A
「Supporting the nonparticipant clubs?」
Shuuichi
「Yes. It's a new role, created this year.」
Shuuichi
「There are clubs that have stated that they are not participating, but the event committee still does wish for all clubs to be a part of this, and so we would like to support those clubs on that front.」

Shuuichi
「I'm sure it will be difficult at times, but I'm sure they'll do well.」
all
Event Committee Member B
「Let's get along, 
Hino-kun and Shinozaki-san
you two
.」
％Ｂ
「Yes! Please, leave it to us!」
Marika
「We'll do our best to live up to your expectations.」
Natsuki
「This is looking like it's gonna be a good story. Even I'm starting to get pumped up now! I'm looking forward to what's gonna come of this!」


％Ｂ
「And so the two of us have joined the event committee.」
We've come to the second chemistry classroom to notify Okihara-senpai about us participating in the event committee.
％Ｂ
「We're here today as legitimate members of the event committee to talk to you, the president of the naturalist club.」

Marika
「Our roles are to support clubs who have indicated that they will not be participating in the Tanabata Festival in two months.」

Misa
「...I see. So that's why you are all here.」

Natsuki
「I'm here because I don't want to let any precious memories slip by, as a member of the grad-alb committee.」

％Ｂ
「We've actually asked for one more person to be here... but it seems she hasn't arrived yet.」
Misa
「Would that happen to be her hiding there by the door?」
％Ｂ
「What?」
all
_00cutinBS
We all turn around toward the door to see Ousaka flinch in the shadows.

％Ｂ
「Oh, you were here. Come in, Ousaka.」
_00cutinBS
Sora
「...」
She doesn't attempt to enter. She's always so wary of others.
％Ｂ
「Hey, Ousaka?」
_00cutinBS
Sora
「...I don't want to become an experiment.」
She still believes that...?
％Ｂ
「Honestly...」
_00cutinBS
I walk over to the door.
％Ｂ
「Here, it's okay. Come in.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
I pull on Ousaka's hand, and she finally steps foot into the room.
％Ｂ
「Let me introduce you two. This is Ousaka Sora, the first-year president of the astronomy club.」

％Ｂ
「And this is the president of the naturalist club. Okihara Misa-senpai, the third year.」
Misa
「My name is Okihara Misa. It's very nice to meet you, Sora-san.」
Sora
「...Same.」
Misa
「If she is president as a first year, then does it perhaps mean that the astronomy club is in a similar situation as the naturalist club?」

％Ｂ
「Yes, that's pretty much it. Both the astronomy and naturalist clubs currently only have one member.」

Misa
「I see... That seems quite difficult, Sora-san.」
Sora
「...I don't mind. I can watch the stars by myself.」
％Ｂ
「Anyway, let's sit there.」
all
I have Ousaka and Okihara-senpai sit next to each other, so that it's Shinozaki and me facing the two of them across the table.

％Ｂ
「Now, I'll explain the situation in full.」
I tell them about the current state of the Tanabata Festival.
About how it's just the astronomy and naturalist clubs that aren't participating in the Tanabata Festival.

About how the event committee's worried that the reason for their nonparticipation is because both of the clubs only have one member each.


And how the committee intends to do everything it can to help both clubs.

％Ｂ
「We won't force you to participate, of course... but the event committee would want nothing more than to have everyone participate.」

Marika
「We'd like to ask you to reconsider... What do you think?」

Okihara-senpai and Ousaka look at each other at the same time.

Misa
「Well... As for me, I'm happy that you feel that way...」

Sora
「...Nonparticipation is fine.」
％Ｂ
「We thought you might say that.」
Sora
「...If I don't need to participate, then I won't.」
％Ｂ
「What do you mean you don't need to?」
Sora
「...The astronomy club looks at stars. We don't need to have fun at festivals. I just want to see Vega and Altair now.」


Natsuki
「Vega and Altair?」
Misa
「Those are Orihime and Hikoboshi. Vega is in the constellation Lyra, and Altair is in Aquila.」


Misa
「On July 7th in the traditional Japanese calendar, those two stars shine their brightest with the Milky Way between them. That once-a-year encounter between the two of them is the origin of the story of Tanabata.」


Sora
「...」
Ousaka silently holds out her right hand to Okihara-senpai.
Misa
「Thank you very much!」
...Seems they've come to terms.
Well, that aside.
％Ｂ
「Both of your clubs have continued activities and research, regardless of the fact that you have no other members. I think that's wonderful.」

％Ｂ
「But what I'd like you two to know is that the fruits of your work can move the hearts of people who aren't familiar with your passions, and get them interested in a world that they've never seen before.」

Misa
「The fruits of our work...?」
Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「Okihara-senpai, you passionately explained everything about the fish and sea the other day at Marinpia Shionagi.」

％Ｂ
「It was almost as if I were actually in the ocean. It was like something out of a dream.」

Misa
「
Ryousuke-san... 
Oh...
」
％Ｂ
「It was plain as day that you love the ocean. It was just incredible.」

Misa
「Thank you very much. Hearing you say that makes me happy too.」

％Ｂ
「Ousaka, you let me look through that telescope of yours, even though we'd only just met. I was so impressed when I saw the moon that close.」


Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「And you taught me lots of things about the moon. I'm sure you wouldn't know even half that much unless you really liked that stuff.」


％Ｂ
「I seriously respect you for how well researched you are.」
Sora
「...Thanks.」
％Ｂ
「I know quite well that the two of you are in your clubs because you feel strongly about the subject matter. And that's exactly why I want you to let others see your knowledge and results.」


％Ｂ
「I don't want it to be just me. I want you to move lots more people.」

Misa
「...」
Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「Please let us help you do that.」
Marika
「I would also like to ask you to let us help you. We'll support you any way we can... so...」


％Ｂ
「Could you please rethink your participation in the Tanabata Festival?」
Misa
「
Ryousuke-san... Marika-san...
Well...
」
Sora
「...」
Natsuki
「Gulp...」
Misa
「...You've told us that you'd like for us to move more people, but to be honest, I don't quite know what I can do.」

％Ｂ
「Oh...」
Is... it going to be a no after all?
Misa
「However... if the two of you are willing to discover that with me, then I think that would be wonderful.」

％Ｂ
「Okihara-senpai...!」
Misa
「What do you think, Sora-san?」
Sora
「...I still don't really feel like participating.」
I guess Ousaka's a no...
Sora
「...But I think I can take back my nonparticipation.」
％Ｂ
「Huh? Th-Then...!?」
Sora
「...Deferred for now.」
Oh, come on!
Though I guess this is good, since I at least got her to take back the nonparticipation!

Misa
「We haven't decided on anything specific yet, so the naturalist club will also defer for now. We will be reconsidering our nonparticipation, leaning toward participating.」


％Ｂ
「Okay! That's enough! Thank you very much, Senpai! You too, Ousaka!」


I hold out my hands to the two of them in my excitement.
They look at each other, and grip my hands back.
Shinozaki places hers on top.
Natsuki
「Here it is, here it is, here it is! This is an amazingly good moment!」
Natsuki
「Oh, I'm gonna put my hand in too!」
％Ｂ
「Are you gonna help too, Segawa?」
all
Natsuki
「I told you before, didn't I? The grad-alb committee works together with the event committee a lot.」


Marika
「...Isn't this great
, Hino-kun

?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah... We did it, Shinozaki!」
all
Sora
「...What should we do now?」
％Ｂ
「Good question. We still need to talk about it.」
％Ｂ
「We'll need to talk over how you guys could participate exactly, and see how realistic our ideas can be...」

Natsuki
「Aghh, whatever! Stop caring about the details!」
all
Natsuki
「We have to deepen our friendship in times like these!」
Marika
「Oh, that sounds nice～」
She has a point. We don't really know each other all that well yet.
Natsuki
「If we're gonna deepen our friendship, we all need to eat together! Eating together this time of the year means camping! So let's all go camping together!」


％Ｂ
「Camping? That's kind of a leap, isn't it? We could just go to a restaurant or something──」


Marika
「Camping sounds great! I want to go～!」
％Ｂ
「Wait a second. Even if you wanna go―」
all
Misa
「I would also like to go. We would be surrounded by nature, which sounds very nice!」


％Ｂ
「What are you saying, Okihara-senpai? It's true that there's nature, but―」

Sora
「...I can see the stars clearly at night. Looking forward to it.」
％Ｂ
「At night... We're gonna stay the night!?」
all
Natsuki
「I dunno about staying the night. But we can still stay late.」

％Ｂ
「No, but...」
Natsuki
「Anyway, we can decide on the details later. Let's just exchange contact details for now. Oh, does everyone have LIME?」


％Ｂ
「Heeey...」
The girls are ignoring me and are getting excited.
What's with this feeling of alienation... We were all only just sitting there, hand in hand...
％Ｂ
「So yeah... we're gonna go camping.」
Shuuichi
「That's... pretty amicable of you all.」
％Ｂ
「I can't tell if we all became friends or if I just got cast out...」
Shuuichi
「I'm impressed. You got them to take back their nonparticipation the first day you joined the committee, and you got them to trust you that much already.」

Shuuichi
「You're really amazing.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, come on... What's all that for? You're creeping me out.」
Shuuichi
「I'm complimenting you, idiot! Just shut up and listen.」
Shuuichi
「I tried convincing Kaori-san... but I never ended up being able to change her mind. But you did it so easily. It's amazing.」


％Ｂ
「S-Sure...」
It feels weird being complimented by him.
％Ｂ
「Hey... By the way, what happened with Kaori-san after that?」
Shuuichi
「What do you mean?」
％Ｂ
「You liked her, right?」
Shuuichi
「...What are you talking about?」
％Ｂ
「Don't play dumb with me at this point. And it's not like you need to play it cool to me, right?」

Shuuichi
「Mm... Well to be honest, that must've been what it was. But I didn't have the courage to try for anything more than that.」


％Ｂ
「So you never confessed to her?」
Shuuichi
「No... but I got that tanzaku from her on the day she graduated instead. She smiled at me and said her wish came true.」


％Ｂ
「So that means that she thought of you as a friend, right?」

％Ｂ
「It meant she wasn't lonely... That things were fun, thanks to you... That's what that'd mean, right?」

Shuuichi
「Maybe.」
％Ｂ
「What the hell, you should've confessed after all! She definitely liked you back, man!」

Shuuichi
「Yeah... I asked later, and that was apparently the case.」
％Ｂ
「Uh... You asked?」
Shuuichi
「Yeah.」
％Ｂ
「Asked who?」
Shuuichi
「I asked her.」
％Ｂ
「...Uhh... What's that mean?」
all
A showy sports car drives up and comes to a stop in front of us.
The driver's-side door opens, and a flashy-looking woman steps out.
？？？／香織
「Thanks for waiting, Shuuichi!」
％Ｂ
「Wha... Thanks for waiting?」
The woman walks up to Shuuichi, hugs him suddenly, and kisses him.

％Ｂ
「Whah!?」
Shuuichi
「Pfah... Hey, stop it. My friend's watching.」
？？？／香織
「But I just wanted to see you～」
％Ｂ
「...Shuuichi-kun... Just who might that be?」
Shuuichi
「Yeah... I'll introduce you. This is my girlfriend... Kaori-san.」

％Ｂ
「Wha... Kaori-san?」
Kaori
「I'm Kaori～ Nice to meet you!」
％Ｂ
「Wha... Wait a second...」
％Ｂ
「S-So you just happen to be dating someone with the same name... or something...?」
Shuuichi
「Excuse me? I don't know what you're thinking, but this is the Kaori-san who graduated last year.」

％Ｂ
「Uh...」
all
This flashy-looking lady's Kaori-san...?
This is the girl who said she was happy as long as she got to read alone in the library?
％Ｂ
「Is this really the one you were talking about? The one who was the only member of the literature club?」

Kaori
「That takes me back. I remember being in the literature club!」
I was imagining Kaori-san to be way more plain, with big glasses or something, and pretty quiet...


％Ｂ
「And wait a second... Didn't you just say you never confessed to her?」

Shuuichi
「Yeah. I never was able to confess. But Kaori-san confessed to me at the graduation ceremony.」

Kaori
「Geez～ Stop it, Shuuichi! That's embarrassing～」
Shuuichi
「And we've been head over heels ever since.」
Kaori
「Heyyy～ Shuuichiii～ Let's go eat already～ Kaori's so hungry～」

Shuuichi
「All right. See you later then.」
all
Kaori
「Bye-bye～」
％Ｂ
「B...Bye-bye.」
The sports car goes screeching away.
％Ｂ
「...I have no idea what his tastes are.」
I stood there dumbstruck for some time afterward.
％Ｂ
「...Now then. Guess I'll go home too.」
％Ｂ
「Oh... Wait... Now that I think about it, did I remember to put my math homework in my bag?」

I stop upon remembering.
I check my bag.
I can't find it.
％Ｂ
「If it's not in here, then I guess it's in my desk. Good thing I realized before leaving.」

Broadcast Club Member
『It is almost time to leave the school. Students that have remained behind for club or committee activities, please bring your activities to a close and begin preparing to go home. To repeat―』


％Ｂ
「Crap! I need to hurry!」
％Ｂ
「I wonder if everyone's gone home already.」
I grab my homework and step out into the hall. It's strangely quiet.
I can clearly hear the sound of my own footsteps echoing around me.
％Ｂ
「I should get going already.」
I hurry down the empty hallway, toward the entranceway.
％Ｂ
「...Hm? Is that a piano?」
It's coming from upstairs.
I recognize this pretty melody.
％Ｂ
「It's Narusawa...」
She must be playing piano in the second music classroom again.
I find myself stopped in place, just listening to the captivating music.
％Ｂ
「...It sounds so nice.」
But it's almost time for them to start cracking down on us to go home.
Maybe she didn't hear the broadcast because of how focused she was?
％Ｂ
「...Guess I'll go take a look, just in case.」
The melody keeps going, even once I'm outside the second music classroom.
Looks like she really hasn't noticed the time.
I open the door and look inside.
％Ｂ
「...Oh.」
The music stops.
Rikka
「...Do you need something?」
It's Narusawa sitting at the piano, just like I thought.
％Ｂ
「You know it's almost time to leave school, right?」
Rikka
「...What about it?」
％Ｂ
「I was just wondering if you needed to go home.」
Rikka
「There's still time, right?」
％Ｂ
「Just a bit, yeah.」
I guess that means she wants to continue playing.
％Ｂ
「Sorry for bothering you. Keep going.」
Rikka
「...」
all
...This is a good opportunity.
I sit down in a nearby seat.
I need to think about what I want to do about Ousaka's and Okihara-senpai's clubs...
Rikka
「...」
％Ｂ
「...」
Narusawa's delicate fingers resume drifting across the keys.
The room becomes a calm space, filled with nothing other than the quiet melody.
...It really does sound nice.
The tone is clear. It really is a beautiful melody...
I don't really know how to describe it, other than saying it's a pretty song.
It almost feels like being enveloped by warm, comforting feathers.
Man... This is nice...
Listening to this makes me...
Kinda wanna just...
...
......
％Ｂ
「Zzz... nnh... zzz...」
Rikka
「...」
％Ｂ
「...Mm... nnh... fuaaah... afhh...」
％Ｂ
「...Huh?」
Where... am I?
％Ｂ
「Ohh... right. I was listening to Narusawa play, and then...」
Rikka
「...」
％Ｂ
「Wait... N-Narusawa...!?」
Narusawa's looking out the window with one hand on the windowsill.
The cool summer night breeze flows in through the window, gently caressing her hair.

A nice, sweet smell tickles the tip of my nose.
％Ｂ
「Oh... M-My bad. Looks like I fell asleep...」
％Ｂ
「Agh, it's already way past when we need to go home!?」
Rikka
「Looks like it.」
But why's she still here?
％Ｂ
「Um... You weren't waiting for me to wake up... were you?」
Rikka
「...I only just got done playing the piano.」
But the piano's closed now, and the keys are covered.
So she really did wait...?
Rikka
「I'm going to go home. Goodbye.」
％Ｂ
「Wha... Oh, I'm going home too!」
I frantically grab my bag and chase after Narusawa.

％Ｂ
「Good thing the school gates were still open.」
Rikka
「...」
％Ｂ
「Where do you live, Narusawa? You take the bus?」
Rikka
「...I walk to school.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, so you live close by?」
Rikka
「Yes.」
％Ｂ
「I'll walk you home, then.」
Rikka
「There's no need.」
％Ｂ
「But it's already pitch black out. You might live close by, but it's still not safe for a girl to walk home alone, right?」

Plus, Narusawa denied it, but I feel responsible for making her wait for me.
Rikka
「I'm used to it.」
％Ｂ
「Sure, but still...」
Narusawa starts swiftly walking away even as we're talking.

％Ｂ
「Hey, Narusawa.」
I walk next to her, looking at the bus stop out of the corner of my eye.
Rikka
「...We walked past the bus stop.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, I know.」
Rikka
「I already said you don't need to walk me home.」
％Ｂ
「My house is this way anyway. I just feel like walking home today.」

I'm not lying.
Distance aside, I really do live in this direction.
％Ｂ
「So I won't walk you home. I'll just walk with you until partway. That's fine, right?」

Rikka
「...You can do what you want.」
％Ｂ
「I'll do that, then.」
Rikka
「...」
％Ｂ
「...」
Rikka
「...」
％Ｂ
「...」
I guess I should've figured Narusawa wouldn't start a conversation...
Though I hoped she would, since we had an actual conversation back when we had lunch together in the music room.

No, no. The first step to making friends with someone is reaching out to them yourself.
％Ｂ
「Uh... I wonder what the weather's gonna be like tomorrow.」
Rikka
「...The forecast says it'll be sunny.」
％Ｂ
「Sunny, huh. Here's hoping it's a nice day, eh?」
Rikka
「...Yes.」
...End of conversation.
Everyone has the weather in common, but here's definite proof that it's not really the best conversation topic.\n 
I need to think of something that Narusawa'd be more interested in.
I've already told her about how I think she's good at piano...
But something music-related should work.
％Ｂ
「You know how some people who do music have perfect pitch, or whatever?」

％Ｂ
「Do you have that?」
Rikka
「More or less.」
％Ｂ
「I'm jealous. What should I do if I wanna pick something like that up?」


Rikka
「Who knows... I picked it up naturally, so I don't know how.」
％Ｂ
「Oh really...」
Another conversation topic swiftly butchered and gutted.
I thought it was a pretty good one, too...
Rikka
「...I hear you can teach yourself with practice, but it's also apparently harder to learn the older you are.」

Wait... Did Narusawa continue the conversation on her own?
％Ｂ
「So when's a good age?」
Rikka
「When you're six or seven.」
％Ｂ
「I'm way past that...」
Rikka
「Perfect pitch isn't useful to have anyway.」
％Ｂ
「...You think so?」
all
I think it's at least cool to have.
Though I guess that's rude to musicians.
Rikka
「Hey...」
％Ｂ
「Hm? What is it?」
I turn to see that Narusawa's stopped walking.
Rikka
「I'm going this way.」
Oh. We're at a fork in the road.
Narusawa turns right here, but I'll need to go straight here if I wanna go home.

Rikka
「Are you going that way
, Hino-kun

?」
％Ｂ
「Uh... Yeah. I need to go straight here.」
Rikka
「We part here, then. Goodbye.」
％Ｂ
「Oh...」
all
She starts walking to the right without waiting for a reply.
Walk her home all the way.
Part ways here.
％Ｂ
「W-Wait up, Narusawa!」
Rikka
「...What is it?」
％Ｂ
「I'm gonna walk you all the way to your place after all.」
Rikka
「...I thought you were just walking with me until partway?」
％Ｂ
「I was, but... Well let's just say I'm walking you home from this point onward.」
Rikka
「There's no need. It's close anyway.」
％Ｂ
「But you never know who or what you'll run into on the streets at night, right? You shouldn't let your guard down just 'cause you're close, or else something might happen.」

Rikka
「What might happen?」
％Ｂ
「Like, some guy might follow you to your house and figure out where you live...」

Rikka
「That's exactly what you're doing right now.」
％Ｂ
「...It's as you say.」
Wait. What am I letting myself get taken down here for?
％Ｂ
「Okay, I know. You can just go home then, and I'll follow about ten meters behind you...」

Rikka
「...Are you a stalker?」
％Ｂ
「...I don't even care anymore. Sure, I'm a stalker.」
％Ｂ
「But there's still a chance that something might happen, right?」
Rikka
「Sigh... Fine. Just do whatever you want.」
％Ｂ
「Okay. Then go on ahead. I'll wait until you've walked for a bit, and then I'll follow―」

Rikka
「Just walk next to me like a normal person. Otherwise, just go home.」
％Ｂ
「S-Sure... Sorry.」
％Ｂ
「Ohh～ ...What a big apartment building～」
It's so tall I might fall over backward trying to look at the highest floors.

％Ｂ
「...And it really was close.」
It was just a few minutes away from the point where our paths would've branched.
This area's apparently a high-class residential area. There were lots of big, impressive houses on the roadside.

Rikka
「That's what I've been telling you.」
％Ｂ
「Either way, I'm glad I got to walk you home safely. We didn't run into any suspicious guys either.」

Rikka
「No suspicious guys... Uh huh.」
％Ｂ
「I'm just a classmate of yours with a proper set of morals.」
Rikka
「I didn't say anything.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, I know.」
Rikka
「...Want to stop inside?」
％Ｂ
「Wha... But, uh, seriously?」
Rikka
「You walked me home. Let me at least make you tea.」
％Ｂ
「Uhh... You sure?」
Rikka
「You're just trying to make a pass on me.」
％Ｂ
「Uh... So you were just messing with me?」
Rikka
「No, I was testing you.」
Rikka
「A classmate with a proper sense of morals wouldn't even consider stepping into the household of a girl that he sits next to in class that he doesn't even know that well.」

％Ｂ
「...Well, I won't deny that I got a little excited at the offer.」
Rikka
「Even though it was me?」
％Ｂ
「'Course. You're a girl.」
Plus, Narusawa's really pretty.
It'd be weirder for me not to get excited.
Rikka
「Really.」
She speaks quietly.
I can't tell what she's thinking from her expression.
all
Eventually, Narusawa turns around.
％Ｂ
「Later, Narusawa. See you tomorrow.」
Rikka
「Yes. See you.」
She starts walking toward the entrance to her apartment.
She takes one...
Two steps away from me...
all
And then stops.
Rikka
「...」
Rikka
「Thank you... for walking me home today.」
％Ｂ
「Wha...」
I freeze at her unexpected words.
She seemed almost expressionless when she glanced back at me... but that was definitely her thanking me just now.

％Ｂ
「S-Sure thing! See you tomorrow!」
I wave at her, and continue to do so until she disappears through the doorway.
She didn't look back at me after the first time, but I'm satisfied.
％Ｂ
「...I'm glad I decided to walk her home all the way.」
％Ｂ
「While I'm here, I should survey this area a bit on the way back.」
I might discover something new on this unfamiliar path home.
I start walking home in high spirits.
...She'd probably hate it if I tried to walk her all the way home after she already told me not to earlier.

I'll just leave it here for now, especially since it seems like her house is close.
％Ｂ
「Later then, Narusawa!」
I yell and wave at her.
_00cutinBS
Rikka
「...See you.」
_00cutinBS
She says it without turning around, and quickly walks away.

％Ｂ
「Now then... I should go home too.」
...I'll need to walk to the next bus stop first, I guess.
