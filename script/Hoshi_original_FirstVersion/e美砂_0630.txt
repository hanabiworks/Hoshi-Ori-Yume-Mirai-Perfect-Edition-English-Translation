Touko
「There, there, here's some food, you guys. Eat lots!」
Touko
「Ahaha, I'm happy to see you all have such healthy appetites. Okay, then let's feed you guys in this tank next.」


Rikka
「...」
Touko
「What? Do you want to feed them too, Piano-chan?」
Rikka
「Wha... I-I never said that.」
Touko
「But you've been watching this whooole time.」
Rikka
「It-It's because you looked like you were having so much fun. I was just wondering what was so fun about that.」

Touko
「It is fun. Wanna try?」
Rikka
「I...I'm... not really...」
Touko
「That so? Then―」
Rikka
「Fine, I'll trade places with you if you want me to so badly. Here, hand me that bottle.」

Touko
「...You wanted to do it, didn't you?」
Rikka
「I just place it in from the top, right?」
Touko
「That's right. A little at a time.」
Rikka
「Wow...They ate it! Did you see that just now? It took the food and ate it in a single bite!」

Touko
「What do you think? Fun, right?」
Rikka
「Uh... Well... S-So-so, yes.」
all
Marika
「Sigh... But I'm in charge of feeding the fish～」

Natsuki
「Mmm... Nice, that was a good expression just now, yellowtail-chan. How about we get you to pose around this grass over here next?」

Sora
「...This fish... is pretty.」
％Ｂ
「...By the way... why are we all here?」
all
Touko
「What are you saying at this point? You're the one who dragged all of us into this.」

Rikka
「That's right. Who do you think set up these tanks in the first place?」
％Ｂ
「I appreciate that, but...」
I wonder if the second chemistry classroom's ever been this full of activity.
Shinozaki and I are here to discuss plans for the Tanabata Festival with Okihara-senpai.\n\r

And before we knew it, everyone else had shown up too.
all
Misa
「It seems we're all interested in how the fish are doing.」
I feel like they're actually just here to kill time...
But whatever, I guess.
％Ｂ
「Let's leave the fish-feeding to them and continue our meeting. Let's see... What were we talking about again?」

Marika
「We were talking about the display location～」
％Ｂ
「Oh, right. Ahem... As for the display location for the Tanabata Festival... the naturalist club is slated to use this second chemistry classroom.」


％Ｂ
「But... as far as I can see, I feel like this room may be a little over capacity in terms of water tanks.」

There are the jellyfish that were already here, and now the yellowtail wrasse and the others.
And we got more fish yesterday too.
Misa
「I apologize. There were just so many fish that I wanted to display, so I...」

％Ｂ
「Oh, no, that's fine. We were thinking about moving to a larger classroom anyway, since this room has tools for experiments set up in it too.」


Marika
「So we talked to Nirasawa-kun before coming here... but it looks like all of the classrooms that we would want are already claimed by other clubs...」


Misa
「I see. That is indeed a problem.」
％Ｂ
「Shuuichi said he'd do what he can to move things around, but worst-case scenario, we may have to end up reducing the number of tanks to display.」


Misa
「That would be...」
％Ｂ
「I'd want to show off all of the fish too, after the trouble we went through to collect them...」

Marika
「But there will also be small children on the day of. If it's too cramped, they may bump into the tanks as they run around...」


％Ｂ
「And I believe the guests would need a certain level of comfort to be able to relax and watch the fish.」

Misa
「You're... right. I understand that. I'd personally love nothing more than to display all of the fish we have, but there is nothing that can be done about that.」

％Ｂ
「We still have time before the festival, so let's wait and see, and decide on what we'll do afterward.」

Touko
「...You just need a big classroom?」
all
％Ｂ
「Huh?」
Touko
「You'd be able to display all of the fish if you had a classroom bigger than this one, right?」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, pretty much.」
Touko
「Then you've got one. There's a classroom that's way bigger than this one, and no other club would use it.」

Marika
「Huh? ...What classroom's that?」
Touko
「The old school building's.」
Yukimura just casually offers up her personal favorite location.


Marika
「Oh... I-I see～ The old school building's big, and the other clubs wouldn't have asked to use it. We could have whatever classroom we liked!」


％Ｂ
「N-No, but...」
all
I stand up, walk over to Yukimura, and whisper to her.

％Ｂ
「Hey, you sure about this?」
Touko
「Hm? About what?」
％Ｂ
「What we're talking about right now. If we end up using the old school building, then people are gonna be in that building every day for preparations.」


Touko
「Well yeah, of course.」
％Ｂ
「That means it's, uh, not gonna be a relaxing place until the festival... You're all right with that?」

Touko
「What are you talking about? I'm the one who brought it up in the first place, of course it's fine.」

％Ｂ
「I know, but...」
Touko
「It turns out I like this mood a lot. Watching these fish is kinda soothing.」

Touko
「But it's a bit bland here. I think it'd be better for this to be in a place that's more aquarium-like. And the old school building's better for that, right?」


％Ｂ
「Yeah, you're right...」
Touko
「So why don't you use it, then? In exchange, you can't let it turn out just so-so.」

％Ｂ
「Okay... If you say so.」
all
That's a lot of responsibility.
Rikka
「The old school building... It'd be nice if they just let us use it like that.」
％Ｂ
「...There's that issue too, yeah.」
Rikka
「That building's off limits, isn't it? Would they really let just the naturalist club use it, even for the Tanabata Festival?」



Natsuki
「I've asked if I could go in to take photos for the grad-alb committee, but I got turned down instantly.」

％Ｂ
「Turned down? ...Who turned you down?」
Natsuki
「The teacher that's in charge of it, of course. Yamashita-sensei, the extracurricular adviser, is the one who looks after the key to the old school building.」

Sora
「...Yamashita-sensei is tough... It was a lot of work getting permission to use the rooftop too.」

Natsuki
「He isn't a bad teacher, but he's juuust a bit stubborn.」
％Ｂ
「So we'll need to get his permission to use the old school building... We'll just have to convince him, then.」

all
Marika
「And I think we might need permission from the event committee too. I don't think Yamashita-sensei would give us permission without it.」

％Ｂ
「Really...」
We've managed to get permission from the owner.
But now we've gotta get it from the event committee and the teacher in charge.
Misa
「...Perhaps we should give up on the old school building after all?」
％Ｂ
「No, we won't know how it goes until we try.」
％Ｂ
「Let's try as hard as we can to negotiate to get usage permission for the old school building!」

Shuuichi
「Permission to use the old school building?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. There aren't any good classrooms over here anyway, right? So we were thinking we could use the old school building.」

Shuuichi
「The old school building... You're right, there are bigger classrooms over there, and the other clubs aren't using it either.」

％Ｂ
「Right?」
Shuuichi
「But I think it'll be difficult to get them to open the building up just for the naturalist club. You'll need a really good reason.」

％Ｂ
「That's why I'm asking you about this, 'cause we need help on that front.」
Shuuichi
「Yeah, but it's not like I can just decide something like this all on my own.」

％Ｂ
「I know that. Yamashita-sensei's the one who's in charge of the old school building, right? So that means there's no issue if we get his permission, right?」


Shuuichi
「Well, yeah... but he's pretty stubborn.」
％Ｂ
「Either way, we want the event committee's permission first. It'll be easier to negotiate with Yamashita-sensei that way.」

Shuuichi
「You'll have to bring that up at the regular meeting tomorrow. Tomorrow's topic is safety management for the Tanabata Festival. Yamashita-sensei's actually supposed to be there too.」


Shuuichi
「I'll square off some time for you, so just convince Yamashita-sensei and the rest of the committee right there and then. It'll be easier that way.」

％Ｂ
「The meeting tomorrow... Got it.」
If he wants me to convince them, then I'll do just that!
