Firm Staff A
「Heeey, Hino. Could you make two copies of this?」

Firm Staff A
「Heeey. Could you make two copies of this?」

％Ｂ
「Huh? Uh...」
Firm Staff A
「Come on, don't space out like that. I need this copied.」

％Ｂ
「Oh... I'm sorry. Right away!」
My senior coworker's words had gone in one ear and out the other.
Firm Staff A
「You gotta get it together.」
％Ｂ
「I'm very sorry!」
Firm Staff B
「You can't blame him. Today's the day they announce the results of the drafting exam, right?」
Firm Staff A
「Huh? Is it really?」
％Ｂ
「Oh... Yes, actually...」
Firm Staff A
「So that means... that the results are probably already up on the internet by now, right?」

％Ｂ
「They probably are, but I'm at work right now... So I thought I'd check afterward.」
I'd probably fall straight into despair if I failed.
I thought I'd try to distract myself with work during the day, but I guess I just can't help but think about it.

Firm Staff A
「No, no. You need to check stuff like this right away. Go on and check.」

Firm Staff B
「That's right. It's not like you'll die if you fail.」
％Ｂ
「Well of course, but...」
But I've got my own circumstances.
Circumstances that make it so I definitely can't let myself fail.\n\r
For Marika's sake... For the sake of a promise made between two men...
％Ｂ
「...Hm?」
That's when my phone rings.
Did I get a message or something?
I glance at the screen just in case...
【Marika】「I looked up your #Nexaminee ID! It says #Nyou passed!!」
【Marika】_st_0104
％Ｂ
「...What?」
I passed?
Firm Staff B
「Oh, mail from your family?」
Firm Staff A
「Look at his face... Looks like he must've passed.」
％Ｂ
「D-Does it... seem that way?」
Firm Staff B
「That's the kind of face most people make when they pass the first-class exams.」
％Ｂ
「H-Hahaha... I-Is that so... Th-That's exactly the case... I passed the first-class exams.」


Firm Staff B
「Well, congratulations.」
Firm Staff A
「That's great. Now you're the real deal too.」
％Ｂ
「Oh no, that's... But still, thank you very much.」

I thought I'd be more jump-up-and-down levels of happy.
But it's more like I'm just relieved. I'm all limp.
％Ｂ
「Phew...」
Azuma
「I hear you passed, Hino.」
Azuma
「Hey. I hear you passed.」
％Ｂ
「Oh... Yes! Thanks to your help!」
Azuma
「All right, then let's wrap things up early today and go celebrate. How about we go all out for once!」

Firm Staff A
「Seriously? Lucky us♪」
Firm Staff B
「I'll go put in a reservation, then! There's a place I've been wanting to go to～♪」

％Ｂ
「I'm sorry, Chief. Thank you very much.」

Azuma
「You've done well to pass on the first try.」
％Ｂ
「It's all thanks to your training. I'll do my best to be of use to this firm.」

Azuma
「Hm, that's a good mindset. I think I'll let you handle this job, then.」

He lays down a heavy folder onto my desk with a thud.
Azuma
「Get this sorted out by the end of the day.」
％Ｂ
「Wha... A-All of this? And more importantly, am I really allowed to do that?」

This is the kind of work that the senior coworkers do. They told me it was still too early for me to work on this stuff.
Azuma
「Of course you are. You're a first-class architect.」

％Ｂ
「Ye...Yes! I'll do my best!」
Azuma
「Get this done today, then. You won't make it in time for the celebration party if you don't hurry, you know.」

％Ｂ
「Yes!」
all
Firm Staff A
「And my copies too!」
％Ｂ
「Yes!」
I feel like doors have opened before my eyes. I've finally begun.
The sensation of finally being able to leap into a wide world that I've always wanted to be in.

But this is still just the beginning.
And knowing that gives me even more strength.
