It's the weekend.
Okihara-senpai and I are going to go do a preliminary look-over of the spots we're planning on collecting fish from for the Tanabata Festival.

Shinozaki and Segawa are supposed to be joining us in the afternoon too.
％Ｂ
「Oh... She's already here.」

I get to the meet-up spot to find Okihara-senpai already there, her nose buried in a book.

％Ｂ
「Good morning.」
Misa
「Oh, good morning
, Ryousuke-san

.」
She looks up and smiles at me.
％Ｂ
「You're here early.」
Misa
「Oh yes. I was just so excited. I'm like a child, aren't I?」

She smiles a little bashfully.
％Ｂ
「I apologize for making you wait, then.」
Misa
「Oh no, it's fine. I was reading.」
She shows me the rather unusual-looking cover to her book.
％Ｂ
「What are you reading?」
I wonder if it's a literary collection or something complicated like that.
Or maybe it's something completely unexpected like some best-selling novel that everyone's been talking about...
Misa
「These are this year's tide tables.」
％Ｂ
「...Tide tables?」
Misa
「It's a book that has the high- and low-tide times for various regions, as well as sunrise and sunset... You are familiar with these books, of course?」

％Ｂ
「I've never seen one before, of course.」
Misa
「Is that so?」
Please don't act as if that's something that every household has...
Misa
「It's very useful for when you want to catch fish. It's a quick and easy way to see when low tide is.」

％Ｂ
「Low tide is when the sea level is lower, right?」
Misa
「Yes. It would be the ideal time to catch fish.」
％Ｂ
「Wouldn't that mean that the fish would also be further from the shore? How would we catch them that way?」

Misa
「There will be fish that have been left behind. We will be collecting them from tide pools.」

％Ｂ
「Tide pools?」
There's another unfamiliar term...
Misa
「Tide pools refer to―」
％Ｂ
「P-Please wait a second.」
I frantically stop her from starting up another lecture.

％Ｂ
「Should we just go to the ocean for now? I think it'd be easier to understand if I saw it directly.」

Misa
「That's true. It is just about low tide anyway, so the timing is perfect.」

％Ｂ
「Then let's go!」
The two of us have come to the ocean.
It's low tide just like she said. The rocky shore that's usually hidden by the waters has been exposed.

Misa
「That would be a tide pool.」
She points out what looks like a natural pool formed from a depression in the rocks.

Misa
「They're also called rock pools. We will be collecting fish that have been left behind in these pools.」


％Ｂ
「Yes, it does look like it would be easier to catch them from those.」
Misa
「Though of course, it wouldn't be guaranteed that there are fish inside...」
all
She then carefully walks toward the largest tide pool.

Misa
「Kyah...!?」
％Ｂ
「Oh, please be careful! The ground is slippery here!」

Misa
「Y-Yes. I'm okay―」
％Ｂ
「Whoah!?」
Misa
「...Are you okay?」
％Ｂ
「...Yes... More or less... It's just one foot... I didn't expect there'd be a tide pool right here...」

I stepped forward while I was telling her to be careful and stuck my leg into a tide pool...
Well, it's pretty sunny today. It'll probably be dry in no time.
％Ｂ
「A-Anyway, how does it look? Do you see any fish?」
Misa
「Let's see... One moment, please.」
all
She peers into the tide pool.
Misa
「...」
She doesn't say anything.
No good, maybe?
％Ｂ
「Um...」
Misa
「...We have hit the jackpot!」
％Ｂ
「Wha?」
Misa
「Please look! See?」
She's suddenly very excited.
all
I approach the tide pool, my wet foot slapping on the rocks, and peer in alongside Okihara-senpai.

％Ｂ
「Uhh...」
...I don't see any fish.
Misa
「See, there!」
all
I look where she's pointing.
But...
％Ｂ
「Hm... Hmm?」
Misa
「There's a pygmy goby there!」
all
％Ｂ
「P-Pygmy goby...? U-Uhh... Oh!」

I squint hard, and I can finally see what's probably the fish she's referring to against the rocks.

I probably never would've spotted it if she hadn't pointed it out because of its camouflage.
Misa
「There's a blenny a bit to its right, too.」
％Ｂ
「What? A blendy?」
Misa
「A blenny! They're known for having horns on their heads.」
all
％Ｂ
「Oh, I see it! You're right, I can see the horns!」
Misa
「And look, even more over there!」
％Ｂ
「Oh!」
I look where she's pointing to see that there are indeed lots more fish in this pool than I thought.

Misa
「We have also managed to find a neon damselfish! That blue one right there!」

A vivid blue fish darts through the water.
％Ｂ
「That one's very pretty!」
Misa
「Neon damselfish are a bright cobalt blue this time of year. But they turn a dull blackish color once the water temperature falls in the winter.」


％Ｂ
「Wow. So that means we can only see them looking that pretty around now.」

all
Okihara-senpai explains a bunch of things as we look through the other tide pools.

Misa
「Among the marine organisms in these tide pools, there are some creatures that have not been left behind in the low tide, but rather choose to remain in them of their own will.」


Misa
「The pygmy goby and blenny that we saw earlier would be examples of that category.」

Misa
「There are also fish known as rockskippers. As their name would suggest, they jump up onto the rocks like frogs, and move between tide pools that way.」

％Ｂ
「Wow, there are fish like that too?」
Misa
「There are many other organisms that live in tide pools, such as shrimp, crabs, clams, seaweeds, and sea anemones.」

％Ｂ
「I see.」
Misa
「There are many different types, even just with shrimp. Off the top of my head, there are Indian bait prawn, Palaemon serrifer, Heptacarpus rectirostris, pistol shrimp―」


％Ｂ
「...」
...An Okihara-sensei lecture has started up again all of a sudden.
She sure knows a lot about the ocean.
I can't help but be amazed at not only the breadth of her knowledge, but also the passion she has for it all.

％Ｂ
「You know so much, Okihara-senpai.」
Misa
「Huh? ...Oh, I'm sorry. I was rambling on by myself...」

％Ｂ
「Oh no, I was just honestly impressed. You seem to know everything about the ocean.」

Misa
「Oh no... I still have quite a long way to go. There are many others who know much more than I do.」

％Ｂ
「Like who, for example?」
Misa
「My parents, as well as the aquarium staff.」
％Ｂ
「Those people are straight-up professionals...」
I think Okihara-senpai might be way past a student's level of expertise at this point.
％Ｂ
「By the way, what's your favorite fish?」
Misa
「My favorite fish? ...Well let's see... There are many fish that I like...」

％Ｂ
「If you had to name one.」
Misa
「Just one species... Hmm...」
％Ｂ
「...」
Misa
「Hmm...」
％Ｂ
「...」
Misa
「Hmmmm... Mmm... Umm...」
％Ｂ
「U-Um... It was a pretty casual question, so I don't think you need to think so hard about it...」

Misa
「But I must think seriously to narrow it down to a single species. I think it would be rude to the fish to give an answer that hasn't been properly thought out.」

％Ｂ
「D-Do you think so?」
She falls back into deep thought.
Misa
「Mhm, within the category of tropical fish, I think I would have to go with the yellowtail wrasse.」

％Ｂ
「Yellowtail wrestler?」
Misa
「Yellowtail wrasse.」
％Ｂ
「Yellowtail wrasse... What kind of fish is that?」
Misa
「Its coloration changes completely when it goes from juvenile to adult. The juvenile is completely bright orange, with white spots with black borders.」


％Ｂ
「Orange with white spots...」
Misa
「Perhaps it would be better to say it looks like a clownfish?」
％Ｂ
「Oh! I know what those look like. It must be a very cute fish.」

Misa
「Yes, but it isn't just cute!」
Misa
「Those white spots get smaller as it grows. The back half of its body goes from orange to bluish, and vivid small blue dots appear!」


％Ｂ
「From orange to blue?」
Misa
「And those blue dots are incredibly beautiful! They're like blue stars, floating in a night sky...」

Okihara-senpai looks dreamily off into the distance.
Misa
「I saw a yellowtail wrasse for the first time in a fish field guide. The moment I saw that photo, I wished to see one in person.」


％Ｂ
「And have you been able to?」
Misa
「Yes! At the aquarium in Okinawa!」
％Ｂ
「That makes sense, since it's a tropical fish.」
Misa
「It was far more beautiful than in the photos, or in my imagination. I can still clearly see the yellowtail wrasse I saw that day.」


Misa
「That deep blue body... The blue dots, glimmering in the lighting... Oh... It was so wonderful...」

％Ｂ
「It-It must've been quite the experience for you.」
She seems completely lost in her memories.
％Ｂ
「By the way, are yellowtail wrasses also found in migratory fish death?」
Misa
「Yes, they are.」
％Ｂ
「Then it'd be nice if we could display one of those for the Tanabata Festival, wouldn't it?」
Misa
「...」
H-Huh?
Now she suddenly looks sad...
Misa
「That would be... very difficult.」
％Ｂ
「Why's that?」
Misa
「Yellowtail wrasses are almost unheard of in these parts. They're native to more southern regions, so I don't believe that we would be able to collect one...」

％Ｂ
「Oh, really? But if it's found in migratory fish death, doesn't that mean it's still possible to...?」


Misa
「I also believed so. But, I have never seen one here so far.」


％Ｂ
「So that means it's a real rarity.」
all
I stare into the tide pool as I say so.
If Okihara-senpai hasn't seen one yet, then it really must be an incredibly rare fish.

I bet she'd be ridiculously happy if I could find one for her...

％Ｂ
「Well, it's not like we'd be able to just find one like―」
...!?
W-Wait a second.
I feel like I saw something blue glitter in the water...
Is this one of those neon damselfish from earlier?
％Ｂ
「...」
No... It's not a neon damselfish...
The body's a lot deeper of a blue than that.
Is this... No way...
％Ｂ
「U-Um... Okihara-senpai?」
Misa
「Yes? What is it?」
％Ｂ
「That blue fish right there... That one... There's this one blue fish inside the tide pool...」

all
She walks up next to me and stares intently into the pool.
Misa
「...!?」
％Ｂ
「Do you see it?」
Misa
「Ye...Yes... I do...」
％Ｂ
「That's not... Is it...?」
Misa
「Yes... It just may be...」
％Ｂ
「So it's, uh... a yellowtail wrasse?」
Misa
「...Yes.」
We look at each other.
Her eyes are wide with excitement.
I bet I must look the same way.
％Ｂ
「L-Let's catch it right away!」
Misa
「B-But, but we were only planning on surveying today, so we haven't brought the equipment for collection!」

％Ｂ
「I-Isn't there anything we could use?」
Misa
「Unfortunately, no...」
all
I rummage through my pockets, but I haven't brought anything that we could use to catch a fish.

％Ｂ
「I'll just have to catch it with my hands, then!」
It might be reckless, but I can't let this opportunity escape!
％Ｂ
「I'll go into the water and catch it!」
Misa
「Wha... Oh, n-no, you can't!」
％Ｂ
「It'll be okay! It's not that deep, and I've already gotten one leg wet anyway―」

Misa
「That is not what I meant!」
I give a start at the unexpectedly forceful interruption.
Misa
「It's dangerous to go into the sea without proper preparations. What would you do if you got hurt!?」

％Ｂ
「B-But... it's shallow...」
Misa
「It may be shallow, but you can never know for sure with the ocean!」
％Ｂ
「That's... You're right... but...」
Misa
「And even if you were able to catch it, we could not take it back with us.」

％Ｂ
「We could just cobble something together for now and...」
Misa
「It may weaken by the time we get to school. And grabbing a fish with your hands can injure it.」

％Ｂ
「That's...」
Misa
「And so we cannot catch it now. We should come back here tomorrow, after retrieving the proper equipment.」

％Ｂ
「But it's not guaranteed that this guy's still going to be here tomorrow.」
Misa
「That's... true, of course.」
％Ｂ
「Once high tide comes, it might leave the tide pool and go back out to sea...」

Misa
「I... understand that.」
％Ｂ
「Is that okay with you!?」
Misa
「...Of course it isn't.」
％Ｂ
「Then...」
Misa
「But... even so, we cannot catch it now. As someone who loves the sea, I cannot allow myself to do something so irresponsible for my own private interest.」


％Ｂ
「Okihara-senpai...」
...She's right.
Even if I could catch that fish right now, there's no point in doing that if we can't safely bring it back to school with us.

％Ｂ
「...I understand. Let's come back here tomorrow.」
Misa
「
Ryousuke-san
Yes
...」
She looks relieved that I understand.
％Ｂ
「I'm sorry... I got too excited...」
Misa
「Oh no, I'm also sorry for yelling like that so suddenly...」
all
We take another look at the yellowtail wrasse.
The deep-blue fish swims around as if to show itself off to us, then moves over toward some rocks and disappears from our sight.


％Ｂ
「Don't worry. We'll be able to catch it tomorrow, once we're fully prepared.」

Misa
「Yes... It would be nice if we could.」
Natsuki
「Oh, there they are! Heeey!」
all
I turn around to see Segawa and Shinozaki cautiously walking over the rocks toward us.

Misa
「Thank you for coming. Are you done with work already?」
Marika
「Yes. I ran into Segawa-san on the way here, so we came together.」

Natsuki
「How's it look? Any fish?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah... It's a shame. You just missed a rare one.」

Natsuki
「Huh? Where? Where? Where is it?」
She looks around at the ocean, camera in hand.
％Ｂ
「It went off somewhere.」
Natsuki
「What the heck! Why didn't you catch it?」
all
Okihara-senpai and I look at each other and smile in response.
all
％Ｂ
「We're just surveying today. We'll come back to catch it tomorrow.」
Misa
「Let's move about the area a little more for today, and then return to school.」
Marika
「Kyah! ...The ground's slippery here.」
％Ｂ
「Be careful. There's a small pool of sea water around there too. I accidentally stuck my foot in it right after―」

Marika
「Kyaaah!?」
％Ｂ
「...Yeah, that's what happened.」
Natsuki
「Thanks for the great photo!」
Marika
「Auuuh～」
％Ｂ
「We're baaack.」
We've come back to the second chemistry classroom.
Yukimura, Narusawa, and Ousaka should be having a good time preparing the tanks here.

％Ｂ
「Wait... It's pretty quiet.」
Natsuki
「Maybe they went home after they finished the preparations?」
Marika
「Or maybe the three of them all went out for lunch together.」
Touko
「...We're here.」
Marika
「Kyah!?」
％Ｂ
「S-So you're here.」
all
Sora
「...Mm.」
Rikka
「Why would we go home without telling you?」
％Ｂ
「R-Right... Well, you guys were being awfully quiet...」
Touko
「Well yeah. There wasn't really anything to talk about.」
Natsuki
「Wait, were you three just working silently this entire time?」

Rikka
「I guess we were.」
Sora
「...We said hello at the beginning.」
Touko
「Pretty much just the bare minimum needed to do this work after that.」
Rikka
「There wasn't anything to discuss anyway.」
Sora
「...Mm.」
Natsuki
「Hey... Did you have these three work together 'cause you knew this would happen?」

％Ｂ
「N-No, it's just coincidence, really...」
But now that I think about it, I guess I shouldn't be surprised that these three ended up like this...

Touko
「Just so you know, it's not like things were awkward or anything here.」

Rikka
「That's true. I felt at ease since we didn't really have to be considerate of each other.」
Sora
「...It was easy to do work.」
％Ｂ
「R-Really?」
Marika
「I guess that's just how it is...」
Well, if they're fine with it, then that's okay...
％Ｂ
「So how'd the tanks turn out?」
Touko
「We just did like Jellyfish-senpai said.」
Rikka
「There shouldn't have been any mistakes...」
Sora
「...But check.」
all
Misa
「...Hahhh...」
％Ｂ
「Wait, Okihara-senpai?」
She's standing in front of the tanks already, apparently not paying any attention to our conversation.

She's looking dreamily at the filled tanks without any fish inside.

％Ｂ
「Excuse me... Okihara-senpai... Do you have a moment?」
Misa
「What? ...Oh, yes. What is it?」
％Ｂ
「They want you to check over the tanks that they set up...」
Misa
「I can tell that they were built properly from the transparency and smell of the water.」

％Ｂ
「Huh? ...You can tell from the smell?」
Misa
「Yes, to some extent. Of course, I'll check the pH values properly.」

She pulls out a stack of what look like post-it notes.
Misa
「This is pH testing paper. You can gauge the pH value of the artificial sea water from how the color changes in response.」


Marika
「Is it similar to litmus paper?」
Misa
「Yes, it is. Typical tap water is pH 7.0 or so. Artificial sea water should ideally be pH 8.0 or above...」

all
She dips one of the sheets of paper into the water.
Misa
「It seems there is no issue. It's perfect!」
％Ｂ
「Oh, that's great!」
all
Touko
「...」
Rikka
「...」
Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「Uh... H-Hey guys... Aren't you at least a little happy or something? Maybe you could high-five each other or something...」

Touko
「Mmm... I don't think I really care that much about that stuff.」
Rikka
「We followed her directions, so of course it turned out well.」
Sora
「...Mm.」
％Ｂ
「You guys... sure are composed.」
all
Marika
「Anyway, now we're ready to house fish.」

Natsuki
「All that's left is for us to actually catch the fish, right?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, pretty much.」
Misa
「Hahh... Knowing that these will soon be filled with lots of fish makes me unbelievably excited for tomorrow.」

Misa
「I think I will have good dreams tonight!」
Marika
「What should I do about my swimsuit tomorrow～」
％Ｂ
「Isn't your usual one fine?」
Marika
「You mean the one I have for sports swimming? That's fine... but wearing something like that at the ocean's a bit...」

％Ｂ
「Then why not something else?」
Marika
「Mmm... But then I'd have more exposed skin, so I'd have to be on top of putting on sunscreen...」

％Ｂ
「Really...」
Sure is tough being a girl.
Marika
「Is Okihara-san going to be wearing a swimsuit too tomorrow?」
％Ｂ
「Huh? ...Well she has to, right?」
Marika
「Okihara-san's got such a nice figure... I wouldn't want to be compared to her.」
％Ｂ
「Compared? Who's gonna compare you two?」
Marika
「Who else is there but you?」
％Ｂ
「Why would I...?」
...I guess I can't really say with conviction that I wouldn't.
And Okihara-senpai does have a nice figure...
Swimsuits...
all
...Wait, what?
Crap... I'm starting to get a little nervous...
％Ｂ
「...」
Marika
「H-Huh? Is something wrong? Your face is bright red.」

％Ｂ
「I-Is it? Uhh, maybe I got a bit sunburnt...?」

Marika
「Yeah, you definitely have to be careful about that. I think it'd be good to take proper care, even if it's a bit late already～」


％Ｂ
「R-Right... I will.」
Marika
「See you tomorrow, then.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah... Later.」
all
％Ｂ
「...Sigh... Why am I so nervous just from imagining Okihara-senpai in a swimsuit?」

％Ｂ
「Thank god Shinozaki didn't figure it out...」
...She didn't, right?
After getting home and eating dinner, I look up yellowtail wrasses on the internet.

％Ｂ
「Yeah, it really is a rare fish around these parts...」
Which means it might've been pretty bad that we let it get away today.
％Ｂ
「I hope we can come across it again tomorrow...」
Our goal tomorrow is to collect fish for the Tanabata Festival.
But all I can think about is that yellowtail wrasse.
I'm sure Okihara-senpai would be happy if we could catch it.

％Ｂ
「...Guess I'll just go all-in.」
I unlock my phone and start up LIME.
【％Ｂ】「You got time to talk?」
％Ｂ
「She might be taking a bath right now...」
【Marika】「Yeah, I'm okay. I just #Ngot done taking a bath.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, there she is.」
【％Ｂ】「Can I ask you for a #Nfavor?」
【Marika】「It depends on the #Nfavor, but okay.」
【％Ｂ】「Do you have any empty #Nplastic bottles? The #Nbig 2L ones. Could you #Ngive me some if you do?」
【Marika】「We wash them out and #Nkeep them stored for #Nrecycling. How many do #Nyou want?」
【％Ｂ】「5, I think.」
【Marika】「...Are you making a #Nrocket?」
【％Ｂ】「No, no. I'll tell you #Nlater what I'm gonna #Nuse them for. Can I #Ncome over and grab them #Nright now?」
【Marika】「My dad's going to take #Na bath soon, so you can #Ncome then.」
【％Ｂ】「Okay. I'll get ready #Nthen, so let me know #Nwhen.」
【Marika】「Okaaay.」
【Marika】_st_0106
％Ｂ
「Okay, I've got what I need.」
I hope this can raise the chances of grabbing a yellowtail wrasse, even just a little!
