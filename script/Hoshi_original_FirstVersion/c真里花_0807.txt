「Ngh...」
％Ｂ
「Fuaaah～ ...Morning already.」
I'm surprised how refreshed I feel, considering how tired I was yesterday.
...But then I casually check the time and my eyes go wide.
％Ｂ
「What? 5:30? It's still only 5:30?」

I know I slept as soon as I got home yesterday... but isn't this too early?

％Ｂ
「Not like I'm an old man...」
Even knowing it's summer, I'm surprised at how bright it is outside.
I open the window and look outside. There are kids playing in the street in front of the house.
...Something's off here.
％Ｂ
「...Huh? Wait, is it 5:30 p.m.!?」
I look at my phone.
My homescreen says "17:34."
％Ｂ
「Oh man, that means I slept for a whole day...」
I got home and went to sleep at around nine o'clock, so that means I slept about twenty hours...

％Ｂ
「...I feel crazy wasteful.」
I let an entire day go to waste...
My phone rings.
It's a LIME message from Marika.
【Marika】「You're awake, right #N％Ｂ-kun?」
【％Ｂ】「Amazingly enough, I #Njust woke up.」
【Marika】「What? Just now!? #N...Well actually, I was #Nasleep until just a bit #Nago. I'm so surprised.」
【％Ｂ】「You too? Now that's #Nrare. Guess that means #Nwe were just that tired.」
【Marika】「Yeah. We're going to #Nhave a big dinner to #Ncelebrate today. Do you #Nwant to come too?」
【％Ｂ】「A celebration dinner? #NYou sure? More #Nimportantly, what about #Nyour dad today?」
【Marika】「Actually, my dad said #Nto invite you.」
【％Ｂ】「Huh? Your dad said that?#N...Why?」
【Marika】「I don't think he means #Nanything by it... So?」
【％Ｂ】「Of course I'll come.」
【Marika】「I'll be waiting, then♪」
【Marika】_st_0103
I place my phone down. I'm in a bit of a cold sweat.
％Ｂ
「What's her dad inviting me over for?」
Is he mad about the declaration I made to him yesterday?
But he wouldn't invite me over if he's mad at me, would he?
％Ｂ
「...Well, there's no point in just thinking about it.」
Let's just go.
％Ｂ
「Err, thank you very much for your invitation...」
Kouji
「...」
What's up with this crazy mood?
Was I really invited to come?
Yumi
「What are you being so quiet for? I'm sorry he's making the mood worse～」

％Ｂ
「O-Oh no, he's not...」
Kouji
「Be grateful I even invited you over. All we're going to do is feed you some food.」

Marika
「Don't act so condescending～ I think that makes you a bit small-hearted.」

Kouji
「Wha...!? Th-That's not true! I may look this way, but I'm known as a dependable man with a big heart at work, you know!」


all
Yumi
「I'm sorry we can only have boring conversations. Don't mind him, just eat up.」

％Ｂ
「I-I certainly will...」
The Shinozaki family's dinner is pretty lavish.
It's a hearty lineup of food, centered around things like fried pork cutlet and fried shrimp.

Kouji
「...Hey. Gimme a beer.」
Yumi
「Yes, yes.」
Have to say though, it's not really filling to eat when Marika's dad is just silently drinking beer in front of me.

Yumi
「I had fun seeing your mother for the first time in so long. It'll be fun once she moves over here too.」

％Ｂ
「Yes, my mother was happy she got to see you too.」
Marika
「If only your dad could've come too.」
％Ｂ
「He apparently wanted to, but he couldn't get away from work.」

all
Yumi
「He must be very busy with work.」
Kouji
「Of course he is. You may have summer break or whatever as a student, but there's no time for that for a real adult.」


Yumi
「Dear, you took a paid day off yesterday. You were so enthusiastic about going to go see the work that Marika was so proud of...」

Kouji
「Uh, gh... Another beer.」
Yumi
「Yes, yes. Don't you think you're going a bit too quickly?」
Kouji
「Just hurry up and pour.」
Marika
「Geez～ Your face is bright red, you know.」
all
Her father gulps down more beer.
He seems completely drunk.
Kouji
「...」
Marika and her mom go to the kitchen to do the dishes once dinner ends.
Which leaves the two of us alone together.
Kouji
「...Hey. More beer.」
Yumi
「We have no more beer left.」
％Ｂ
「Um, perhaps you should stop drinking now...」
Kouji
「...What did you just say?」
％Ｂ
「N-No... Nothing.」
Kouji
「Honestly, what a waste of space. Can't you even pour some alcohol?」

％Ｂ
「Uhh... But...」
There aren't any more beer bottles on the table.
I look around. My gaze stops on a bottle of Japanese alcohol.
％Ｂ
「Oh, then, would you like some of this? Shionagi shochu, "Comfort."」

Marika
「Dad, don't make him pour for you. You're already really drunk.」

Kouji
「This much alcohol is nothing. You just go take a bath, Marika.」

Marika
「But...」
Kouji
「Don't butt in between two men. Now just go take your bath.」

Marika
「Geeeez. I have no idea what you're saying...」
％Ｂ
「It's fine, Marika. You can take a bath. I'll be talking with your dad.」

Marika
「Okay... I will. I'm going, then.」
Marika
「Don't cause trouble for Ryousuke-kun, okay Dad?」
Marika
「Don't cause trouble for him, okay Dad?」
all
And so it's just us two again.
％Ｂ
「Oh, then... I'll pour this. Would you like it on the rocks? Or a water cut? We could use hot water too... but it may be a bit too much in summer...」


Kouji
「I guess a water cut... And what? You seem pretty knowledgeable for a student.」

％Ｂ
「It's not because I drink it myself, just so you know. I poured drinks for my father quite a lot. He actually likes my pours a lot...」


I head toward the kitchen with the bottle of shochu in hand.
Yumi-san's already prepared water, ice, and a glass for me.

％Ｂ
「Let's see, like this... Okay.」
％Ｂ
「Here you go. I hope you enjoy it.」
Kouji
「Hm... Hm, not bad.」

He sips a little, and then nods.
Looks like he likes it.
Kouji
「...So you said your parents are both from Shionagi.」
％Ｂ
「Yes, they are. My father changed jobs, and so our family moved away...」

Kouji
「Where do your parents live now?」
％Ｂ
「Kanagawa. We lived in southern Machida... It's an industrial area...」
Kouji
「Oh, around there... That takes me back.」

％Ｂ
「Do you know the area?」
Kouji
「We used to live there. Marika was born over there too.」

％Ｂ
「...What?」
...I've never heard that before.
％Ｂ
「I-Is that true?」
I thought Marika was born and raised in Shionagi.
Kouji
「I moved near Tokyo to go to university. That's where I met Yumi. We were from the same town, so there was that too...」


He nostalgically tells the tale of his past.
Marika's mom and dad when they were young... I can't really imagine it.

Kouji
「And I found employment while I was there. We eventually had Marika, but her asthma was always terrible back then...」


I remember the sight of Marika in her bed back in grade school.
She had been battling against her sickness since far before then.
Kouji
「Yumi may be the way she is now, but she was a real worrier back then... She thought about Marika day and night.」

I glance toward Yumi-san.
She looks like she's still washing dishes in the kitchen.
But her hands haven't moved in a while.
Kouji
「But I don't blame her. Marika's asthma didn't have any schedule, so we could barely even get any sleep.」

I can tell how severe it must've been from his tone.
But I bet it was way worse than I'm imagining.
He can talk about it nostalgically now, but...
Kouji
「We were at our limit. I thought... our entire family'd just give up at this rate. So I moved here to Shionagi, where my relatives lived.」


Kouji
「That way, we could get their support, and more importantly, the air here is good. I thought it'd be a great place for Marika.」


Kouji
「And luckily, a friend of mine had a company over here, so I should've been able to make ends meet too.」

％Ｂ
「...Should've? Things didn't end up that way?」
Kouji
「When it rains, it pours. My friend's company went bankrupt within a year of us moving here. I ran around all over the place looking for work.」


Kouji
「Fortunately, I did manage to find a job, but I wasn't used to that kind of work at the time... It took everything I had just to overcome what was right in front of me, both at home and at work.」


He takes a big gulp of the shochu.
The remaining ice clinks in the glass.
His eyes are red.
Kouji
「I was living desperately every day... not knowing whether she'd become better. Whether she'd be able to grow up.」

Kouji
「But you see, Marika's my daughter.」
His voice seems to leak out from between his lips. His shoulders shake.
Kouji
「She's the only daughter I've got.」
He sounds like he might be crying.
I can't tell what expression he's making because he's looking downward.
But I can clearly feel the weight of his emotions.
Kouji
「You might be her boyfriend or whatever, but what do you think you know...」
％Ｂ
「...」
My words catch in my throat for an instant.
I can keenly feel an absolutely incredible weight.
The weight of his affection for Marika.
％Ｂ
「...You're right. I might not know anything.」
Kouji
「That's right... You and her both, you're just too busy being happy to know...」
％Ｂ
「But if you're going to believe anything I say, I'd like it to be this. I love Marika. I'm serious about that.」


Kouji
「You're just a kid... What are you saying? ...You're not even a fully grown man yet...」

％Ｂ
「You're right. I'm a kid. I'm not fully grown.」
I've been brought face to face with my own inexperience countless times.
I know that I can't do anything unless I have everyone there to support me.

％Ｂ
「But I'll become an adult. I'll become a man who can make Marika-san happy.」

I say it quietly, but I pack every ounce of conviction I have into those words.
Kouji
「...」
％Ｂ
「So when that time comes... Could you approve of my relationship with Marika-san?」

Kouji
「Honestly. You're... just so annoying. I had a bad impression of you the moment I saw you...」

Kouji
「But... that's a promise between men.」
％Ｂ
「Oh...」
Kouji
「If you turn out to be a half-assed man... I won't forgive you.」
He then falls over.
Looks like he was at his limit from all that alcohol.
％Ｂ
「...」
Marika
「...Looks like Dad fell asleep.」
％Ｂ
「Huh? Marika? I thought you went to go take a bath.」

Marika
「Oh, yeah... I was just brushing my hair～」
Kouji
「...Snoooore～」
Marika
「I knew it～ ...Come on, let's get you to bed, okay? Mom, help me.」

all
Yumi
「Yes, yes. Come on, dear. Let's stand up.」
He wobbles to his feet with Marika and her mom holding him up by the arms.
This is kinda heartwarming.
Marika
「...Um.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah?」
Marika
「Thanks.」
She says it shyly.
She might've been listening to my conversation with her dad.

all
And so the slightly strange night came to a close.
