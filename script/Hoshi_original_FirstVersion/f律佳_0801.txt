I'm checking up on Rikka and Meguru-chan's practice session again today while I have the time.

The two of them are face to face with the sheet music.
I feel like they spend more time talking to each other than actually playing.

Meguru
「Let's take a break then.」
all
Looks like they've just finished a meeting of some sort.
％Ｂ
「I've been wondering, but how do you signal to each other that you're about to start playing when you play piano four hands?」
They don't say anything, and I'm pretty sure they're not looking at each other as a signal or anything either.
Meguru
「Signal? We don't use a signal.」
％Ｂ
「Wha, you don't? So how do you play together, then?」

Rikka
「It just happens naturally... I guess. Your breathing matches up as you go.」

Meguru
「We don't really have to pay attention to when the other is starting.」

Meguru
「When we used to play multiple pieces in a row in duo contests together, we'd always play perfectly in time without even trying. Hehehe... It was just so much fun.」
Rikka
「It was, hehe. I'm sure it must seem strange to someone who hasn't seen it before.」

％Ｂ
「Huh...」
They're being pretty casual about it, but isn't that actually pretty amazing?
Or maybe it's just totally normal for musicians?
all
Rikka
「I'm thirsty. I'll go buy something cold to drink. Is there something you want?」

％Ｂ
「I'll go get the drinks if you're thirsty.」
I try to volunteer myself because I want to help, but...
Rikka
「...」

Meguru
「...」
Rikka frowns. Meguru-chan smiles at me sympathetically.
Wh-What's going on?
all
Meguru-chan taps me on the shoulder and speaks into my ear.

Meguru
「She wants to go to the bathroom. She's just too embarrassed to tell you.」

％Ｂ
「Oh...」
I get it now.
Rikka
「...I wish you could have said it a little quieter.」
Meguru
「Ahaha. You can't stay embarrassed forever.」
Meguru
「You have to find your resolve if you want to be together with him for a looong time. Oh, I want milk tea.」

％Ｂ
「I'll have a cola, then.」
I hand Rikka money for my drink.
Rikka
「I'll be going, then.」
Meguru
「See you.」
The two of us watch her leave.
Meguru-chan turns toward me after a bit.
Meguru
「Seeenpai.」
％Ｂ
「Hm?」
Meguru
「―Thank you very much.」
She bows her head low.
％Ｂ
「What's this for?」
Meguru
「Because you're always together with Onee-chan, so I can only say this in times like these.」

Meguru
「I knew Onee-chan was troubled, but I wasn't able to do anything for her... Because anything I said would've only hurt her...」
Meguru
「Me saying anything would only make things worse... That's why I had to pretend nothing was wrong... I had to act like I always do, making sure to not touch upon anything delicate.」
Meguru
「But looking back on it, I think that if I had just said what I really felt, even if it hurt her, there may have been something more after that... I think I may have just been afraid.」
％Ｂ
「...」
Meguru
「That's what I thought... but I keep doing unnecessary things...」

％Ｂ
「That's not true. You did your best too.」
Meguru
「Wha...?」
％Ｂ
「Lorelei.」
Meguru
「Lorelei? That's the name of a German witch from one of Heine's poems, isn't it? What about her?」
％Ｂ
「That's what Rikka said when she heard you play "A Fragment of Emotion." "Were there any ships that didn't sink after being lured by Lorelei?"」
％Ｂ
「That performance was your message to Rikka, right?」

Meguru
「Ahaha... So you noticed.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. Didn't realize it right away, though.」
Meguru
「I wanted my performance... my feelings to reach Onee-chan.」

Meguru
「But it seems like that only made Onee-chan even more troubled...」
％Ｂ
「I'm sure it was a necessary thing.」
％Ｂ
「Being troubled means you're facing your problems. Rikka's always been running away, but your performance got her to run headlong into her issues.」

％Ｂ
「Lorelei's lure didn't sink the ship. Lorelei was on the ship to begin with.」

％Ｂ
「Your voice awakened the other Lorelei.」

I smile, and Meguru-chan smiles too.
Meguru
「Hehehe. I'm so glad you were here for Onee-chan, Senpai.」

Meguru
「I'll show you an incredible performance as thanks, ehe.」
She smiles happily.
Her smile is as radiant as the sound of her music.
％Ｂ
「Yeah. I'm looking forward to it.」
Meguru
「Oh, but... I won't lose to you in terms of my love for Onee-chan.」
％Ｂ
「Haha, I'm not planning on losing either.」
Meguru
「So anyway, what do you think about that anyway? Are you considering marriage?」

％Ｂ
「Wha, marriage!?」
Meguru
「I'm sure Onee-chan is. She's got strong feelings, like you've seen. She's like, "I'll only give my heart and body up to one man in my lifetime."」

I can't help but laugh when I see her impression of Rikka.
But she pulls it off pretty well. They really are sisters.
％Ｂ
「It's a real honor for me to have been selected as that one person, then. And as for marriage... I want it to happen someday, yeah.」

％Ｂ
「I'm still inexperienced, so I still have to do a lot of work to be able to make her happy.」

％Ｂ
「I'll become a man who's worthy of her that way.」
Meguru
「You're way too much of a good man, Senpai. What are you going to do if you end up popular with the ladies? You'll make Onee-chan sulk, even if you don't mean to.」

％Ｂ
「That's never happened to me before. And besides, if we're talking about stuff like that, then I feel like I'm the one who's way more likely to end up jealous.」

Meguru
「Wha? Onee-chan isn't popular at all, though.」
％Ｂ
「Huh?」
We pause and stare at each other blankly.
％Ｂ
「No way. That's gotta be a lie. She's so pretty and cute, and has a great personality.」

Meguru
「Thank you for the adorable brag♪」
％Ｂ
「Uh... Sorry.」
Meguru
「Mmm～ ...To be precise, she could be popular, but she isn't. You know how Onee-chan's always got this wary aura around her when she's with people she doesn't know well.」

Meguru
「She's so prickly when you try to talk to her, and she always tries to distance herself from others, so most people don't try to get through that to get close to her.」

Meguru
「A normal person would lose heart... Wait. Senpai, are you a masochist?」

％Ｂ
「No, I'm not!」
Meguru
「Aha. I'm sorry. That was a joke, please don't get so angry.」

Meguru
「You're a hardcore sadist, aren't you? Onee-chan might appear that way, but she's very dependent and is very meek toward people she trusts.」
％Ｂ
「Hahaha...」
I guess that's her younger sister for you. She really knows her well...
Rikka's indeed the type who likes "having things done to her" more than "doing things" in bed.
Knowing that Rikka's family must have some form of insight into our intimacy makes me feel indescribably itchy.

Meguru
「I think you can only start to see Onee-chan's good parts once you get to know her.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. I think I get what you mean.」
Meguru
「I'm very grateful to you, Senpai. For understanding Onee-chan and being by her side.」

Meguru
「Thank you very much for falling in love with her.」
She smiles brightly and shows me her affection directly.
It's embarrassing enough to make me want to avert my eyes... but I think I have to respond properly.

％Ｂ
「I'm glad I met Rikka too.」
Meguru
「I'm sure Onee-chan would jump for joy if she heard you say that.」
Meguru
「Please say that to her afterward too. Though it's you, so maybe you've already told her, hehehe.」

％Ｂ
「And you too, Meguru-chan.」
Meguru
「Wha?」
％Ｂ
「Because I was able to learn lots more about Rikka thanks to you.」

Meguru
「Hehe. So it's still about Onee-chan? She's just everything to you, isn't she?」

％Ｂ
「I won't deny it.」
％Ｂ
「But I'm glad I met you in general too. You make our lives brighter and more fun.」

Meguru
「Thank you very much. I'm also very happy to have met you.」
Meguru
「Though now I have a very formidable rival in love. Hehehe.」
％Ｂ
「Haha!」
Laughing together like this is nice.
Meguru
「I'm just so glad that Onee-chan's come to like her own piano playing again.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah.」
Meguru
「A pianist's performance has to be delicate. But their body and will have to be tough.」

％Ｂ
「Rikka said the same thing before.」
Meguru
「Onee-chan did?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. She was talking about how she couldn't be strong.」
Meguru
「Yes... Onee-chan's kind. She's incredibly kind.」
Meguru
「I'm not saying that kindness equals weakness, but it's true that one can't live with just that alone.」

Meguru
「If you're fighting alone, there will be times when you have to throw away your kindness. But Onee-chan can't do that...」

Meguru
「And maybe that's why she needs support? A bird can't fly without wings. But if it has wings, then it can fly as high as it pleases...」

Meguru
「Please continue to support Onee-chan from now on.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah!」
I nod vigorously.
Meguru-chan smiles in relief.
Rikka gave up on the path of being a pianist once.
Her playing piano together with Meguru-chan again doesn't mean all of her problems have been solved.

It's only a small portion.
I don't know what kind of answer she'll produce from within herself in the future.

That's why I want to be there to watch over her, and lend her a helping hand when necessary.

Rikka
「Hehe. You two seem like you're having fun. What were you talking about?」

％Ｂ
「Welcome back.」
Meguru
「It's a secret. Right, Senpai!?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, I guess so.」
Rikka
「A secret, is it...」
Meguru
「Hehehe. Are you jealous, Onee-chan?」
Rikka
「N-No, I'm not jealous...!」
Meguru
「It isn't anything you need to worry about, Onee-chan. My love's for you and you only～」

She hugs Rikka and links arms with her.
Rikka
「Geez, you'll make me drop the drinks! Let's start practicing right away once we're done with our break.」

Meguru
「Okaaay～ Milk tea, milk tea!」
She's complaining, but her eyes still look adoringly at her younger sister.
These two sisters seem like they'd be a poor fit for each other, but they've got a proper balance between them.
I hope I'll get to watch this kind of warmth forever.
