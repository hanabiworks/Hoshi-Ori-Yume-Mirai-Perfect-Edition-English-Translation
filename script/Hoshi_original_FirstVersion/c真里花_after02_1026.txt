Azuma
「You have those materials ready?」
％Ｂ
「Yes, I do.」
Azuma
「Good. Then make ten copies each of those. And make sure you eat. Today's going to be a tough day.」


％Ｂ
「I understand. I'll go bolt some food down!」
all
Once I'm done preparing the materials, it's time for a quick lunch break.
I get my lunch ready, and...
％Ｂ
「Hm? It's Marika.」
It's a LIME message from her.
【Marika】「When are you going to #Nbe done today? Want to #Ngo home together if the #Ntime works out?」
【％Ｂ】「I have a conference #Nmeeting today, but #Nprobably around 7. Does #Nthat work?」
【Marika】「Yeah, that works. #NI wanted to buy rice, #Nbut it's heavy so I was #Nthinking of asking my #ndependable husband to #Nhelp.」
【Marika】_st_0110
【％Ｂ】「I get it now. You can #Ncount on me. I'll carry #Nas many bags as you #Nwant.」
【Marika】「I won't buy that many～ #NI'll see you at 7, then.」
【％Ｂ】「I'll let you know when #NI'm done.」
【Marika】「Thanks again, really.」
【Marika】_st_0102
％Ｂ
「Okay! Eat, and then work!」
Marika
「Are you okay? Isn't that heavy?」
％Ｂ
「I'm totally fine. I may look the way I do, but I do carry materials at the construction site and stuff.」


Marika
「Wow～ Architects do things like that too?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, since I'm still a novice. But working at the site is a good way to know what's going on, and I get to be on better terms with the foreman and the construction workers.」


％Ｂ
「The veteran workers sometimes turn up their noses at what a young whippersnapper like me says... but at least I'm acknowledged for being there.」


Marika
「Really. That sounds like a lot of work.」
％Ｂ
「No, it's fun. We're all on the same side, 'cause we wanna make a good house together.」

Marika
「Oh really. I'd be happy having an architect like you, Ryousuke. I wish you could build a house for us someday.」


Marika
「Oh really. I'd be happy having an architect like you. I wish you could build a house for us someday.」


％Ｂ
「I'll do it. I'll design our house and build it... that's another dream of mine I wanna fulfill.」


Marika
「Okay, I'm looking forward to it♪」
all
I wonder what our family'll be like by then.
How many kids will we have, and how old will they be?
I wonder if we'll have boys or girls.
It's fun imagining what changes I'd make to the house plan, depending on what our family might be.

Marika
「Oh... Can we stop by this drugstore real quick?」
％Ｂ
「Drugstore? Sure, but why? You feeling sick or something?」

Marika
「No, I'm not... It'll be really quick.」

all
She leaves without giving a clear answer.
Is she gonna buy something that's awkward to talk about?
％Ｂ
「Like... a stamina tonic or something?」
Is tonight gonna be a night of passion?
Marika
「N-No, it's not～」
She turns bright red.
It apparently wasn't a stamina tonic.
％Ｂ
「What other options are there? ...Oh, is it something for your period or...」
Marika
「I don't think it's that either～」
She denies that too.
％Ｂ
「Oh, sorry. Maybe I shouldn't ask, then?」
Marika
「Oh, no, it's okay～ It's not something that weird～」
Marika
「Um, it's the opposite. Um... I haven't had my period in a while...」

％Ｂ
「You haven't had your... Wait, doesn't that mean...?」

Marika
「I-I don't know for sure yet! But it's never been this late before... so I thought it might be good to check.」


She opens the drugstore bag.
As expected, there's a pregnancy test inside.
％Ｂ
「Let me take a look at it.」
Marika
「O-Okay～」
all
I take the box from her and look at it.
It apparently takes a minute to know the results after you put urine on the tip.
％Ｂ
「So it's that quick...」
Marika
「It's just a simple test, though. A-Anyway... Off I go～」

％Ｂ
「S-Sure.」
She heads toward the toilet.
I'm starting to get nervous...
Eventually, she comes back.
％Ｂ
「H-How'd it go?」
Marika
「...U-Umm... It's a bit early for you to look... it's kind of embarrassing～ I peed on this...」


％Ｂ
「Don't worry about that stuff. I wanna know the results.」
Marika
「Okay... Yeah, you're right. H-Here you go～」

She silently hands over the pregnancy test.
％Ｂ
「Two red lines... So that means...」
Marika
「...It tested positive...」
％Ｂ
「And so, that means...」
Marika
「It looks like we made a baby... We still don't know for sure until we get a hospital to check, but...」


％Ｂ
「Oh, really... We made one... I see...」
all
Marika's got a kid in her.
It's ours... My kid.
This doesn't feel real at all.
We won't know if she's really pregnant until she gets tested... but...

But...
％Ｂ
「We did it, Marika!!」
My emotions overwhelm me, and I hug her tight.
Marika
「Hah～」
But Marika's got a blank look on her face.
Marika
「...U-Umm... I'm sorry, I don't know how to react... This has never happened to me before, so...」


％Ｂ
「Y-Yeah, that's true.」
％Ｂ
「But... I'm really happy. This is our kid we're talking about here!」

Marika
「Yeah, you're right... Our baby...」

Tears suddenly fall from her eyes as she says it.

％Ｂ
「H-Hey? What are you crying for?」
Marika
「I can't help iiit... I'm so happy～ We're going to have... a baby～」

She's wiping at her face with her hands as she cries like a child.
Marika
「Fueeehhh... I'm so happy～」
％Ｂ
「...Ahaha. Yeah, me too, Marika. Thanks.」

all
Marika
「Fueeeehhh～～～」
I gently embrace her as she continues to cry.
No. I'm not just embracing Marika.
Our child is here too.
We're a family of three now.
Marika
「I-I'm so happy... Fueeehh～～～」
I gently stroke her shoulders.
Her tears of joy continue on for what seems like forever.
