I wake up and immediately grab my phone.
【％Ｂ】「Who was our homeroom #Nteacher back when I #Nwent to grade school #Nhere again?」
【Marika】「I think it might've #Nbeen Miyazawa-sensei...」
【％Ｂ】「Right, Miyazawa-sensei! #NYou think he's still at #Nthat school? Did he #Nchange jobs?」
【Marika】「I went to go say hi #Nwhen I first entered #NShionagi First Academy #Nand he was still there～」
【％Ｂ】「All right, that's #Nawesome. Thanks!」
【Marika】「Also, are you still #Nhome? You're going to #Nbe late.」
【％Ｂ】「Sorry, but I'm not #Ngoing to school today.」
【Marika】「Is everything okay? Are #Nyou not feeling well? #NYou're not sick, are #Nyou?」
【％Ｂ】「I need to go somewhere. #NYou handle things today!」
All right, let's get going!

「Good morniiing!」
Azuma
「Snooore... Zzz... Snooore... Zzz...」
I walk into Azuma-san's firm to find him snoring on the sofa. Just like I expected.

％Ｂ
「Good morning, Teacher!」
Azuma
「Nnh... aah...?」
He gets up and looks at me blearily.
Azuma
「What... It's just you... What time is it?」
％Ｂ
「It's nine o'clock. In the morning.」
Azuma
「...Nine o'clock... I see... Nine o'clock... Good night...」
all
％Ｂ
「Wait, wait, wait! Please stay awake! I'll make you coffee right away!」

Azuma
「Phew... Slurp... Hahhh... So what are you doing here so early in the morning?」

％Ｂ
「There's something I wanted to ask you about.」
Azuma
「I see... You mind if I ask you a question first?」
％Ｂ
「Go on ahead.」
Azuma
「Today's a weekday, right? Don't you have school? I'm just gonna let you know right off the bat that if you give me some fake-sounding excuse like you're off because it's Founding Day or something―」


％Ｂ
「Sorry. I ditched.」
Azuma
「...That's weirdly upfront, and I like it.」
％Ｂ
「Then may I ask you a question next?」
Azuma
「...Sure, fine.」
％Ｂ
「Please tell me what you know about Marinpia Shionagi.」
Azuma
「Marinpia? Ah... that aquarium. It's a shame, I hear it closed down in May. What about it?」

％Ｂ
「I'm currently doing research on Marinpia.」
Azuma
「Hoh... And why would that be?」
％Ｂ
「I'm currently involved in a group that's making an aquarium for our school's Tanabata Festival next month―」

Azuma
「Stop right there, I know what you want. You want to use that aquarium as inspiration, and so you've come to me, the architect that designed Marinpia, right?」

％Ｂ
「No... Um... I'm doing research on why Marinpia closed down.」

Azuma
「...And why would you come to me for that? ...Are you saying it was because of my design?」

％Ｂ
「Of course not! Your designs are perfect, Teacher! That aquarium is emblematic of your work as an architect!」

Azuma
「So you're saying an aquarium that closed down due to a lack of popularity is emblematic of my work...」
％Ｂ
「Th-That wasn't what I meant!」
Azuma
「I know. I'm kidding. Like you said, I put a lot of effort into that design. You could say it's one of my proudest works.」


Azuma
「It's a shame that it closed down... but well, the possibility was always there. I did the most I could.」

％Ｂ
「Th-That! I want to know about that!」
Azuma
「Uh? What are you talking about?」
％Ｂ
「I've heard that Marinpia Shionagi closed down due to a lack of popularity. But I can't believe that's the real reason.」
％Ｂ
「Like I said earlier, that aquarium's design was perfect. The layout and design of the tanks was genuinely amazing.」


Azuma
「R-Right... Thanks.」
％Ｂ
「I don't think you can find an aquarium like that just anywhere. In fact, I think it should've been the talk of the town.」

％Ｂ
「And Marinpia's website has a forum with lots of comments that were talking about how it was a shame it was closing down. They're really recent, too. I can't believe that the aquarium closed down because of a lack of interest.」


Azuma
「So you're saying that there has to be another reason it closed down?」
％Ｂ
「One that wasn't a lack of popularity, at the very least.」

Azuma
「...Well, that's true. That place had a decent number of customers, as far as I know.」
％Ｂ
「So then why?」
Azuma
「In a nutshell, probably money.」
％Ｂ
「But they had customers, right? Then...」
Azuma
「The plan to get people to come to Shionagi by building an aquarium was a good one. But the plan had financial difficulties right from the get-go. And on top of that―」


％Ｂ
「Sigh...」
I sigh on reflex after leaving the firm.
％Ｂ
「I get it now...」
As the designer, Azuma-san really knew a lot.
I got to hear a lot of vivid details from someone who had directly been involved.

From what I heard, the reason Marinpia closed probably wasn't really because of a lack of interest.\n\r

That's good news for me, but...
％Ｂ
「I feel like this just kinda made things foggier.」
I feel kinda refreshed, kinda disappointed after hearing the real reason behind its closure. It's weirdly depressing.

％Ｂ
「...Though I guess there's no point in thinking about it now. I need to get to my next location.」

Next on my list is to go to my old grade school and meet with Miyazawa-sensei, my old homeroom teacher.
