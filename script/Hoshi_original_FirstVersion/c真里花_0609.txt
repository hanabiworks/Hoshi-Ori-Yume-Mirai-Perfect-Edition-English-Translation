I'm walking to school with Shinozaki, who came to pick me up.
It still feels like the weekend.
$$smh_OpenCHK
Marika
「Camping was so fun～ It was hard waking up today. I think I tired myself out.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, my stomach hurts...」
Marika
「A-Ahaha... Because you ate all of those super-spicy rice crackers.」
％Ｂ
「Either way, I think that really helped break the ice with Okihara-senpai and Ousaka.」

Marika
「Yeah, I think so too... yeah. They both seemed like they had fun. I feel like we got closer with them.」


％Ｂ
「I hope they trust us now.」
Marika
「I think your feelings got through to them
, Hino-kun

～」
％Ｂ
「Really? I sure hope so.」
Shinozaki's words are encouraging, but I'm still a little worried.

Marika
「Don't worry, I'm sure it'll be fine. If you're still worried...」

％Ｂ
「If I'm still worried?」
Marika
「Oh, nothing... yeah. It'll be fine.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah. I'll just have to wait.」
all
％Ｂ
「It's lunch break...」
Maybe I'll go see what's going on in the committee room...
Rikka
「You've been restless all morning.」
％Ｂ
「What? You can tell?」
Rikka
「I sit next to you, after all.」
％Ｂ
「There's something on my mind.」
Rikka
「Hmm. Does it have something to do with those two?」

％Ｂ
「Those two?」
all
I follow Narusawa's gaze and turn around.

There are people standing in the classroom doorway.
It's Okihara-senpai, and Ousaka, who's hiding behind her.
％Ｂ
「...Why are they here?」
_00cutinBS
_00cutinBS
Rikka
「I'm sure they think it's awkward to just walk in. Why don't you go talk to them?」

％Ｂ
「I should! Thanks, Narusawa.」

all
I run up to the two of them after thanking Narusawa.
Misa
「Oh! Hello! I was just looking for you, 

Ryousuke-san, 

when I happened to run into Ousaka-san.」

Sora
「...It's hard to go into upperclassman classrooms.」
％Ｂ
「I thought that might be the case. Um, if you two are both here, then...」

Misa
「Yes. I wished to hand this in.」
She holds out an envelope.
％Ｂ
「Is this for...?」
There are neatly folded papers inside. The paperwork for participating in the Tanabata Festival.

Misa
「Please check through to make sure there are no inadequacies.」
Sora
「Mine too.」
Ousaka timidly holds out her sheaf of paperwork.
I check over them just in case, but I already know what they are.\n\r
It's the paperwork for the astronomy club to participate in the Tanabata Festival.
％Ｂ
「So... the astronomy club's gonna participate in the festival too?」
Sora
「That's what it says.」
Misa
「I'm very sorry for having you wait so long. I very much look forward to working with you.」

％Ｂ
「Oh no, the pleasure is mine! I'm super happy that you two are going to participate! The event committee will lend you its full support!」


Misa
「That's very heartening to hear!」
％Ｂ
「Please, just treat this as if you've set sail on a large, sturdy boat!」
Misa
「Oh, how wonderful... A boat! Being at sea is so very relaxing. I do certainly feel that way right now.」


Sora
「...I want to be on a spaceship.」
％Ｂ
「Is that relaxing for you?」
Sora
「I could be on one forever.」
％Ｂ
「U-Uh huh...」
％Ｂ
「But, thank you very much. You too, Ousaka... Thanks. You even handed it in directly to me...」


To be honest, I was expecting to have to stop by their clubs over and over to get them to trust me more.


Misa
「We heard that you had been worrying about it all morning
, Ryousuke-san

. And so we thought that we should relieve you of that worry as soon as we could.」

％Ｂ
「What? You heard I was worrying... From whom?」
Sora
「Mari.」
％Ｂ
「Huh? You mean Shinozaki?」
Sora
「*nod*」
Misa
「She came to my classroom during break this morning.」
Sora
「Mine too.」
％Ｂ
「Shinozaki went to your...」
She never said anything about doing that.
I can't imagine it was easy to go to a first-year and third-year classroom alone.
Especially since she's a bit of an introvert.
Misa
「Oh, but I must stress that she didn't press us to do this. She simply came by to thank us for joining the camping trip...」


Misa
「And one other thing. She said something very wonderful.」

Sora
「...*nod*」
Misa
「She said that anything would be fun if we all did it together, and that we might be able to accomplish anything that way.」


％Ｂ
「Anything would be fun if we do it together... We could accomplish anything...」

Sora
「Could we do... a planetarium?」
％Ｂ
「Huh? A planetarium?」
Misa
「It appears the astronomy club wishes to create a planetarium for the Tanabata Festival.」
％Ｂ
「A planetarium...」
Sounds like something an astronomy club would do.
Just imagining it convinces me that it'd be fun.

％Ｂ
「We can do anything. Let's make the most beautiful planetarium ever. I bet tons of people'll come.」


Sora
「I don't care about people. I just want to see it.」

％Ｂ
「I-Is that so... Well whatever, that's fine too. And what will the naturalist club do?」

Misa
「...」
Misa
「I would like to have an aquarium.」
％Ｂ
「An aquarium...」
Marinpia Shionagi comes to mind.
The time when Okihara-senpai guided me through the empty aquarium.
％Ｂ
「Of course we can do that! Marinpia may have closed down... but we can just make one ourselves.」


Misa
「That... sounds very wonderful.」
She smiles a little bashfully.
A planetarium, and an aquarium.
This is getting pretty crazy.
I'll have to go say thanks to Shinozaki later.
Girl A
「Hey, Marika. There's a boy here to see you.」

Marika
「Wh-Whaaaat～!? I don't know any boys...」

％Ｂ
「That's not quite true, is it?」
Marika
「Oh...
Hino-kun

!?」
％Ｂ
「Yo.」
Girl A
「Wait a minute～ What's going on? What is he to you!?」

Marika
「H-How am I supposed to answer that? ...H-He's a friend...」

Girl A
「You just said you didn't know any boys.」

Marika
「I do now, starting this summer! Oh, well actually, I've known him for a long time now～ Umm, umm...」


％Ｂ
「Now, now. No need to interrogate her like that.」
Girl A
「How suspicious...」
％Ｂ
「Anyway, Shinozaki, you got time right now? I've got some good news related to the committee.」

Marika
「Y-Yeah, I can talk!」
I have her come out into the hallway.
Marika
「I wonder what they're saying about me right now...」
She seems nervous about what's going on inside her classroom.
％Ｂ
「It's not weird to have guy friends, is it?」
Marika
「Um... Yeah, it isn't, normally～」
％Ｂ
「Anyway, I've got good news. I got the participation paperwork from the naturalist and astronomy clubs.」

Marika
「Oh, really? I'm so glad～!」
％Ｂ
「I heard you went to their classrooms.」
Marika
「Oh... You heard about that? Um, I wanted to thank them for coming yesterday...」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, but that apparently got them to decide to participate.」

Marika
「Wh-What? ...Really, all I did was just talk to them a bit...」
Marika
「But I'm so glad～ I was hoping we could all do something together, after we had so much fun camping.」


％Ｂ
「'Cause anything's fun when we're together, and we can accomplish anything, right?」

Marika
「Y-Yeah... That's what it felt like. I know it's just how I personally think about it, but...」

％Ｂ
「No, I thought the same thing. Thanks, Shinozaki.」

Marika
「N-No, it was nothing...」
She turns bright red and looks downward.
I can't believe someone this shy managed to convince those two.

It's especially surprising to me, since I still can't help but think of her as bedridden in my mind.

％Ｂ
「But you know, I would've come along if you had just said so. Ousaka might've been fine since she's an underclassman, but Okihara-senpai's classroom must've been nerve-racking, right?」


Marika
「But you're so nice
, Hino-kun

. I thought you wouldn't want to rush them. Oh, but it's not like I wanted to rush them either...」


％Ｂ
「Yeah. I know. Okihara-senpai told me that too.」

Marika
「I just wanted to tell them that I enjoyed the camping trip, and that I wanted to do something like that again in the future. And I remembered what you were like back when we were kids.」





％Ｂ
「What I was like?」
Marika
「You know how you used to come over a lot? That made me so happy. I had someone who was waiting for me at school.」


Marika
「So I tried following your example.」
She smiles bashfully.
Her smile's dazzling. I find myself a bit lost in it.
Man. Time sure has passed since back then.
Marika
「I'm honestly so happy～ What did the two of them say they wanted to do?」

％Ｂ
「A planetarium and an aquarium. I wanna discuss that after school, so let's meet up in the committee room as soon as classes end.」


Marika
「That sounds amazing～! Let's do our best supporting the two of them!」

％Ｂ
「Yeah. Let's make this festival as fun as we can.」
all
We went camping to deepen our friendships with Okihara-senpai and Ousaka...
But I think it might've helped me get a little closer to Shinozaki too.
After school...
Shuuichi
「An aquarium, and a planetarium...」
Shuuichi looks conflicted. We've just told him that the naturalist and astronomy clubs are participating, and what they want to do.

Shuuichi
「Hmm...」
Shuuichi
「Hmmmmmm...」
％Ｂ
「What's that face for? You should be like, "Bravo, ％Ｂ! Thank you so much for being my friend!"」

Shuuichi
「That makes it sound like I don't have friends!」
％Ｂ
「Just look at that face you're making.」
Shuuichi
「No, it's not like I'm not happy. It's a good thing that those two clubs have decided to participate. But those plans... I don't know about those.」


Marika
「Wh-Why? I think an aquarium and a planetarium sound nice～」

Shuuichi
「Yeah. I think they're excellent ideas.」
％Ｂ
「So what's the issue, then?」
all
Misa
「...Would it be a matter of their realizability?」
Okihara-senpai speaks up for the first time.
Shuuichi silently nods.
Sora
「...You mean we can't do it?」
Shuuichi
「I didn't say that. But I don't think it'll be easy.」
all
Shuuichi
「I don't think we have enough of a budget or enough manpower to carry out those plans.」

Shuuichi
「Both clubs have only one member. We have limited finances as well... I think it's too ambitious.」


％Ｂ
「Well, I guess...」
all
Now that he's said that, I think I can see his point.
I may be an amateur, but even I know that putting together an aquarium or a planetarium wouldn't be easy.

But...
％Ｂ
「But our role is to help them achieve their plans, isn't it?」
Shuuichi
「But we'll need people for the festival itself too. I wish I could offer more helping hands, but we have our limits.」

Shuuichi
「The two of you will have to support these two clubs alone... Can you really do that?」


Marika
「I... think we can... if we all give it our best...」
Shinozaki's voice sounds like it might disappear.
all
『Anything's fun if we're together, and I feel like we can accomplish anything.』

Shinozaki's words come to mind.
Something suddenly flashes through my mind. Maybe it was inspired by those words.
％Ｂ
「I think we can.」
Marika
「Oh...」
So I say it clearly.
all
Shuuichi
「How are you planning on pulling it off?」
％Ｂ
「Together.」
all
Sora
「Together?」
％Ｂ
「That's right. Don't you think we could pull off an aquarium and a planetarium, both in one go?」

all
Shuuichi
「You mean you're going to combine the two plans? I guess that would double your available budget, and let you focus your efforts on one project...」


Shuuichi
「But how are you planning on combining the two?」
％Ｂ
「Well... the sea and the sky are pretty close thematically, right? So I think we could showcase both of them in the same place. It'd be like...」


％Ｂ
「Aghhh, I can't really put it into words...」
I'm frustrated with my inability to put the vague image in my mind into words.

Shuuichi
「I get that it's hard to explain something you've only just thought of... but we won't be able to get permission from the school until you have something specific in mind, you know.」


Shuuichi
「It's possible that we'll get a no if the plan's too vague.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. I know. Let me get my thoughts together. I'm sorry about this, you two.」


all
Misa
「Oh no. I'm also interested in what your thoughts are. Please let us know once you have the details together.」

Sora
「...Planetarium...」
％Ｂ
「I know. Don't worry.」
But the image in my head is still blurry.
How can I describe this to the others...?
all
Marika
「Oh, so it's like you're imagining something, but it's still blurry.」
％Ｂ
「Exactly. I've got this fuzzy image in my head, but it sucks 'cause I can't really describe it.」


Marika
「Mmm, is there a nice way to describe the image in your mind...?」

％Ｂ
「I guess I should sharpen that image in my mind first. There's no point in trying to communicate it otherwise.」

Marika
「Hmm, an image, an image... Oh, I know! What if you tried to draw it or something?」

％Ｂ
「Draw it?」
Marika
「You've always been good at drawing. You know, like how you drew all those pictures for me on the backs of those printouts?」




％Ｂ
「Draw it... Yeah, that sounds good. I can probably work out the details by doing that too.」

Marika
「Yeah, I'm sure you could. I think drawing it's a great idea～」

％Ｂ
「...All right. I'll do it as soon as I get home!」
％Ｂ
「Thanks, Shinozaki. I might be able to pull this together, thanks to you.」

Marika
「Uh, um... Th-Then, could I help too?」
％Ｂ
「You? Like, you wanna come over?」
Marika
「Um, m-maybe... I can't?」
％Ｂ
「No, it'd really help. Two heads are better than one. And if we work together... Get what I'm saying?」


Marika
「Yeah!」
％Ｂ
「Okay. Let's hurry home, then!」
Marika
「Oh, I wish you'd wait for me～」
Marika
「...」
Shinozaki's sitting stiffly, looking timidly around my room.

％Ｂ
「I've only just moved in, so there's probably not that much interesting stuff here, is there?」
Marika
「Oh... Sorry for staring at your stuff... I was just jealous of how clean your room is.」

％Ｂ
「It's my dad's prized new house, after all. Now then...」

all
I grab a few books from my bookshelf.
Marika
「...Are those architecture books?」
％Ｂ
「Yup, it's the personal library that I've scrounged together. Being able to present your work to a client's important as an architect, so there's stuff about those kinds of techniques in these.」


Things about how to get people to understand your intentions when you propose your plans.
I'm sure there was something about that somewhere in these.
Marika
「Oh... Look, here. It says... "Proposing something to someone is the same as asking a question of yourself."」


％Ｂ
「I see. I feel like I get it.」
all
Making a proposal is essentially about putting your intention into words and images.
I'm sure doing that shows you what parts were missing inside you, or what parts are different from your original ideas.

％Ｂ
「Let's put it into words first, and then sketch it out... Okay, Shinozaki. Could you listen to me talk about what I've got in mind?」

Marika
「Huh? Me? I'm a bit nervous～」

％Ｂ
「Ahaha, all you've gotta do is listen. Let's see. Maybe I should take notes or something.」

all
I pull out a sketchbook and pencils.
％Ｂ
「It's still a fuzzy vision...」
I just say what's on my mind. Not really trying to probe my own thoughts yet.
I draw out a simple sketch.
A huge tank of water, with fish inside...
％Ｂ
「I think an aquarium and a planetarium can coexist. It's like the sea and the sky are bundled together in my thoughts...」

I draw over my first sketch with dark strokes.
A starry sky.
Marika
「Oh, yeah, I get what you mean. Like how you usually draw the sky when you draw the ocean. And aquariums are usually dark, too.」


％Ｂ
「Right, exactly! Aquariums are dark. People usually only look at the tanks when they're in an aquarium, but if there were stars right above them...」


I use an eraser to draw stars into the parts I've darkened.
Marika
「Oh... I feel like I've seen something like this drawing before～」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. Same here.」
A deep blue ocean world.
Fish flitting back and forth.
And a darker sea of stars above.
Marika
「...It's so pretty.」
She sounds entranced.
I think Shinozaki and I must be imagining the same thing.

It'd be amazing if you could relax and spend time in a place like that.
I think it'd appeal to people who like that kind of location.
all
％Ｂ
「Okay. Let's try getting more specific with the drawing. I should get a bigger sheet of paper.」

I dig through my closet and pull out a sheet of A3 drafting paper.
I face the sheet of white paper and let the image swell in my mind.

％Ｂ
「I'll sketch the outline with charcoal and use watercolors for color. Shinozaki, you can draw cute stuff.」

％Ｂ
「You know, like that cute giraffe you drew when we were camping.」
Marika
「I wouldn't say I'm great at it... but I like drawing animals, yeah.」
％Ｂ
「That's all I need. I'm gonna draw out the rough outline, so could you draw in stuff like the water tanks and fish?」


Marika
「Okay. I'll try it.」
％Ｂ
「I think this is gonna turn out great.」
The white sheet of paper lies there before us.
But we have a pretty solid image in mind.
All that's left is to give it a proper form.
