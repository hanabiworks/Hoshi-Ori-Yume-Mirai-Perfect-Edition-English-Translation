Thanks to the people of the Shionagi marketplace, we were able to get enough cardboard to make the dome.

But there's still only a few days left before the Tanabata Festival.
We're working on our construction at fever pitch.
Marika
「I'll grab the parts you've cut out.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, thanks.」
Touko
「Come on, come on, we're almost done with painting over here, you knooow. Hurry up and cut!」

Rikka
「...I'm doing it now.」
Our despair's done a 180 and become nothing but hope.
Hope that we'll be able to complete the dome in time!
We can make a request to the school to stay the night here for preparations too.

Which of course we've already done, and it's been approved.
％Ｂ
「Phew... The end's nearly in sight.」
Marika
「The paint will be dry by tomorrow, right?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah... Let's put it together first thing tomorrow.」

Rikka
「I hope things go well this time.」
Natsuki
「No worries! I never make the same mistake twice!」
Touko
「I'm pretty sure the first mistake wasn't your fault, Camera-chan...」

all
％Ｂ
「...By the way, where's Sora?」
Misa
「She left for the roof to practice her talk. Perhaps you would like to check on how she is doing?」


Marika
「We're good over here now, so go on～」
％Ｂ
「You sure? Okay then...」
all
Touko
「Don't start flirting around just because there's no one else on the roof, okay?」
％Ｂ
「No... I already told you we won't...」
...I was actually kinda considering it.
Yukimura's sharp...
all
I've come up to the roof.
The stars are pretty again tonight.
I can't see as many as usual, because the school's lit up with all of the other students who are also staying the night.

％Ｂ
「Uhh... Let's see... Sora...」
I spot her where we usually set up the telescope.
She's using the real night sky to practice her talk.
Sora
「...One can see a very bright star above the Milky Way. A star bright enough that it can be seen clearly even with the naked eye. This is one of the representative stars of summer, the constellation Lyra's Vega.」


％Ｂ
「...」
Sora notices me, but she continues talking.
Sora
「Vega is famous as Orihime from the legend of Tanabata. You are all aware of the legend of Tanabata, yes?」

Sora
「There is another star on the other side of the Milky Way. Now then... Whatever could this star be?」

％Ｂ
「...Hikoboshi.」
Sora
「That's right, Hikoboshi. Orihime and Hikoboshi are married stars. Now then, let us find Hikoboshi next.」

Sora
「We will start at Vega, and move southeast, crossing the Milky Way... You can spot another bright star, shining beautifully in the night sky.」

％Ｂ
「...」
Sora
「...A star just as beautiful as Orihime. This is Orihime's husband, Hikoboshi, also known as Altair, the constellation Aquila's first-magnitude star.」

She points at Altair.
And then―
％Ｂ
「Oh... A shooting star!」
Sora
「...Wha...?」
A single shooting star cuts through the night before us.
％Ｂ
「I wish for the dome to be safely completed I wish for the dome to be safely completed I wish for the dome to be safely completed!」

Sora
「...Not in time at all.」
％Ｂ
「Y-Yeah, I know... But I figured I should still make a wish...」

Sora
「...That was probably part of the Perseid meteor shower.」
％Ｂ
「Perseid meteor shower?」
It's that thing from the stargazing party I went to when I was a kid.
Sora
「The Perseids are one of the three great meteor showers, together with the Quadrantids and the Geminids. You can see the Perseids a lot around this time of year.」


％Ｂ
「Oh, I think I've heard of those before.」
Sora
「...Just seeing a shooting star is an omen of a wish coming true. There's no need to say it three times.」

％Ｂ
「...O-Oh, really...」
Who the heck made up the whole "say it three times" thing...?
％Ｂ
「Hm? So then that means a meteor shower makes that many wishes come true, right?」

Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「Which means my wish is probably included in there somewhere. All right, good. I'm really thinking we'll be able to complete the dome by tomorrow now.」


Sora
「...I like that.」
％Ｂ
「Hm?」
Sora
「...Your explanation just now was interesting. I want to use it in my talk. Can I?」




％Ｂ
「Yeah, of course. You can use as much stuff like that as you want.」
Sora
「...Thank you.」
％Ｂ
「By the way, what was your wish?」
Sora
「...My wish...?」
She looks at me intently.
Sora
「...It already came true.」
％Ｂ
「Wha...?」
She gives me a bright smile, walks up to me―
Sora
「...Mh... nh... Fh...nh...」
And kisses me gently.
Sora
「Mm...～～～ ...Nnh...～～...fh...」
％Ｂ
「...」
Sora
「Nh... Hahh... It's... already come true.」
She smiles again.
％Ｂ
「...I see.」
all
We hold hands and look up at the starry sky together.
...As another shooting star cuts through the night.
