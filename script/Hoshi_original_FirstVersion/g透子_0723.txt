「It's so hot... Maybe I should cool off somewhere while I wait...」

$$smh_OpenCHK
We need to take care to not get heatstroke.
We'll probably wander around a bit before lunch, so maybe we should start by getting something cool to drink first.

Touko
「Thanks for waiting. You're early again today.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, you're here already? Same for you. There's still half an hour before when we're supposed to meet up.」

Touko
「I just thought you'd be here by around now. Ahaha, it looks like I'm really starting to get you.」

％Ｂ
「Oh, come on now. Don't think you understand me with just that. I'm a deep man, with lots of nuances.」

Touko
「Mmm... You sure it's not that you cause lots of nuisances?」
％Ｂ
「You sound like Shuuichi...」
Touko
「Agh, I don't wanna be lumped together with Four-Eyes-kun. Maybe I should wear glasses too?」

Touko with glasses... Now that I'm imagining it... It doesn't sound bad.
It'd have to be ones with a red plastic frame.
Touko
「Mmm...? You're making a dirty face, you know. I see... So you have a glasses fetish too...」

％Ｂ
「I do not! I just thought it'd probably look cute!」

Touko
「Ehehe, thanks. Getting complimented like that makes me want to try it too.」

She's got me playing her game.
I don't want to be losing like this. Let's counterattack.
％Ｂ
「Hmm... Glasses and your school uniform... A swimsuit could work too... Maybe we could go all the way... with a maid uniform...?」

Touko
「Wha, hey... Wh-What...? Your eyes are scary...」
％Ｂ
「Don't worry about it. I'm just imagining things. Something sporty would be good too... Basketball, soccer... or maybe we could do something out there and go for a martial arts uniform...」

Touko
「N-No, no, that's embarrassing! Don't say stuff like that out loud!」

％Ｂ
「Hmph. That's what you get for calling me a pervert over and over.」
Touko
「Geez... You need to tell me those things when it's just the two of us. I won't be able to do it for you otherwise, you know.」

％Ｂ
「Wha...?」
Touko
「I'll consider it if you just tell me. I'm interested in those kinds of things too.」

％Ｂ
「...Ugh. I can never win.」
Touko
「Ahahah! I won, I won! Today's snacks are your treat, then!」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, yeah. Then how about we go and get some drinks right now? Today's crazy hot.」

Touko
「That sounds like a good idea. Let's rest up somewhere nice and cool before we go shopping.」

all
％Ｂ
「The city's starting to get serious about Tanabata Festival preparations.」
Touko
「You're right. I'm sure this whole city's going to transform on the day of the festival.」
％Ｂ
「It's been a long time since the last time I was here for that... I'm looking forward to seeing what it'll be like.」

Touko
「What was it like before?」
％Ｂ
「I don't really remember too well... but I think it was a pretty huge festival. There was stuff like goldfish scooping, balloon fishing, shooting galleries... I remember I walked around a bunch of festival stalls.」


Everything I saw was so new to me. It was a lot of fun to play with the stuff at the stalls.\n \n\r
I remember my friends and I would try to see who could bounce their superball the highest, and how I really wanted a glowing wristband.

Touko
「Ahaha, sounds like what a boy would do. So you were a little rascal?」
％Ｂ
「That makes me sound like I was just some brat...」
Touko
「Well, you are a bully, aren't you? You always seem like you're having so much fun when you're bullying me.」

％Ｂ
「Th-That's different! Besides, that's not bullying, it's more like it's the flip side to my love... All guys are like that!」


Touko
「I don't know what any other boys are like. You were the first boy to bully me.」

You're telling me this now?
And here, out in the city like this?
％Ｂ
「And besides, I bet you were a tomboy! You love messing around!」

Touko
「I was a good girl. Everyone thought I was a serious girl who was well behaved and didn't cause trouble.」

％Ｂ
「...I can't imagine that at all.」
Touko
「What the heck, how ruuude! I'm still a good girl!」
％Ｂ
「But you went out and had tons of fun when you went to stuff like this, didn't you?」

Touko
「Mmm... Well, I guess I wanted to try eating cotton candy and candied apples.」
％Ｂ
「You've never had those?」
Touko
「Mhm. I've never been to a festival in general. They only sell those at stalls at festivals, right? My parents were both busy with work, so I never had anyone to go with.」


％Ｂ
「...」
Touko
「Ahaha... I'm not really good at talking about the past, so that's enough from me.」

I feel bad about asking her that.
I'm sure she'd just say she doesn't mind if I apologized.

I want her to experience that fun atmosphere.
Nothing would make me happier than if Touko were happy with me.

Touko
「I'm looking forward to the Tanabata Festival.」
％Ｂ
「...Yeah. Let's have a ton of fun. Together.」
all
％Ｂ
「Hm?」
【Marika】「The day after tomorrow #Nseems to work for #Neveryone, so we will be #Nhaving our lunchbox #Nparty then!」
【Marika】「Please assemble at the #Nold school building on #Nthat day with your #Nlunchboxes!」
【Marika】_st_0108
％Ｂ
「Oh, it's the lunchbox party. Shinozaki was really excited for this.」
【Sora】_st_0310
【Rikka】「Normal lunch food is #Nfine, right?」
【Misa】「I think it is. I will #Nprepare a little more #Nfood than I usually do #Nfor lunch.」
【Misa】_st_0220
【Natsuki】_st_0204
【Natsuki】「The day after tomorrow, #Ngot it!」
Touko
「...The day after tomorrow. I wonder if I'll be able to make a lunch for that.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, we'll have to do our best for then. Let's respond.」

Touko
「...Okay.」
all
【％Ｂ】「Got it. I'll have #Nsomething ready.」
【Touko】「I'll try my best too.」
【％Ｂ】_st_0307
She squeezes my hand tight after she sends the message.
I squeeze back to reassure her.
all
【Marika】「I'm looking forward to #Nit. Don't forget to be #Nthere, everyone!」
【Marika】_st_0103
Don't worry, Touko. It won't turn out that way.
Even if you do mess up, it'll eventually just become something to laugh about later... as a good memory.
