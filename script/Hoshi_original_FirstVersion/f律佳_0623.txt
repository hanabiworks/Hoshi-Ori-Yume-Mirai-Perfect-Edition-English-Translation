I've been on edge all morning since I sat down at my desk after getting to school.

And of course, the reason why... is Narusawa.
This'll be my first time seeing her since I went to her place on Saturday. I've realized that I like her, and the feeling's only grown and grown since then.

The girl in question isn't here yet.
I keep glancing behind me, at the classroom door.
How should I greet her? ...Well, I guess I should just say good morning like I always do.

It'd be weird to suddenly change things up.
Good morning. Just like usual. Just say good morning.
Narusawa walks into the classroom five minutes before the first bell.
Rikka
「...」
She smiles gently when she sees me... Or at least I feel like she does.

all
My pulse quickens as she gets nearer.
She places her bag on her desk, and then our eyes meet.
％Ｂ
「Narusawa―」
Rikka
「...G-Good... morning.」
She blushes, looking a little embarrassed.
She's greeted me first today.
％Ｂ
「Mor!」
Rikka
「...?」
I froze with my hand upraised at the sudden surprise.
'Cause, what!? Narusawa never says good morning first!
％Ｂ
「―ning, Narusawa.」
I finish my greeting as if nothing happened, and lower my hand.
I can hear my heart thundering in my chest.
all
Narusawa sits down at her desk and starts moving her writing utensils and textbooks inside from her bag.

％Ｂ
「Hahhh...」
I turn away from her and exhale quietly.

I-I was so nervous～～
I then spot Segawa covering her mouth as she laughs at me.
all
I'm having the now usual music lesson with Narusawa again today.
％Ｂ
「Do, re, mi, fa, sol, la, ti, do.」
Rikka
「I don't think there are any more issues with your pitch for solfège.」
％Ｂ
「All right!」
Rikka
「Don't get overconfident. The notes don't just steadily increase in pitch in actual songs. Like this, for example.」

She plays two separate notes.
％Ｂ
「Do, and... fa, I think.」
Rikka
「Correct. Let's move onto matching the pitches of separated notes. It's harder than you'd think. Try singing after I play, like before.」

％Ｂ
「All right.」
％Ｂ
「Do, faa.」
％Ｂ
「...Huh? Did I make the fa a bit too low?」
Rikka
「It's because you're too used to singing the notes in order.」

Rikka
「It's easier to get the pitches right when you sing consecutive notes because the change is gradual, but it's harder once the notes are separated.」

％Ｂ
「Guess that means I'm still a beginner.」
Rikka
「But you understand it, don't you? It's just that your voice hasn't figured it out yet. Practice is the only way for you to get a grasp on the distances between notes.」
Rikka
「And you've progressed astonishingly fast since we first started. If all you want is to pass a practical exam in a music class, then I think it should only take a little more work.」

％Ｂ
「Getting your seal of approval's suddenly got me thinking I can do this.」

Rikka
「Don't let yourself relax because of that, okay?」
％Ｂ
「I know. Please teach me until the very end, Narusawa-sensei.」
Rikka
「Hehe. Shall we resume our lesson, then?」
all
％Ｂ
「Do, sol. Do, sol. Do, sol.」
Sora
「What are you doing?」
We're cutting panels out of polystyrene for displaying Segawa's marine wildlife photos from yesterday. Ousaka tilts her head at me when I sing as I work.


％Ｂ
「I'm practicing singing pitches. It's harder than you'd think. Give it a try.」

Sora
「Do, sol.」
％Ｂ
「Wha...!?」
Sora
「How'd I do?」
％Ｂ
「I think you got it perfectly...」
What? Whaaat? Is it supposed to be that easy?

Touko
「Do, sol. Aha, that's kinda fun.」
％Ｂ
「Agh...」
Yukimura too!?
all
Misa
「Do, sol. Fufu... How very nostalgic. I remember practicing like that in preschool.」
％Ｂ
「I'm below preschoolers!?」
all
％Ｂ
「N-No way... Shinozaki, you too?」
Marika
「U-Umm, mhm, yeah, I think I can... Do, sol...」
％Ｂ
「Doh... soool...」
all
Hahahah... Well yeah, okay, I guess, well sure, right...
I asked Narusawa to teach me 'cause I couldn't do it in the first place anyway, and all that matters is I can do it in the end, you know? I guess it's like, uh, all's well that ends well? Maybe?


％Ｂ
「Hahaha... Oh, looks like we don't have enough boards, eh? ...I'll go ask the student council for more...」

We don't have much of a budget, but the student council will procure simple supplies for us if we ask.

Marika
「Don't worry about it! You don't need to be good at music to make it through life!」

Sora
「That isn't encouraging.」
Marika
「Oh, I mean! I mean! You're wonderful in lots of ways, so you don't have to be good at music!」


Sora
「That isn't encouraging?」
Marika
「Hah, uuuh...」
％Ｂ
「Thanks, Shinozaki. I'm doing my best to learn from Narusawa right now, so I'll get better.」

Marika
「Oh... Mhm! I'm looking forward to it!」
Shinozaki smiles at me as I depart from the second chemistry classroom.
all
％Ｂ
「Do, sol. Re, la. Mi, ti.」
％Ｂ
「Sigh... That took longer than I thought.」
I did get the boards, but the student council was apparently pretty busy with discussions and preparations for the Tanabata Festival...

So I ended up having to wait a while until someone was free to help me.

And thanks to that, it's almost time to go home by the time I get back to the second chemistry classroom.

％Ｂ
「Fa, do. Do, mi. Fa, la.」
％Ｂ
「Speaking of which, I wonder if Narusawa's still practicing.」
She said she'd be practicing piano today after her work with the concert team.

％Ｂ
「It's not on the way, but I guess I'll go see.」
％Ｂ
「Huh, that's weird.」
I'm near the music classroom, but I don't hear any piano.

Normally this hallway's filled with pretty melodies...
％Ｂ
「...Maybe she left already.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, no, she's here.」
％Ｂ
「...Narusawa?」
Narusawa's sitting in front of the piano, apparently deep in thought. She doesn't seem to have noticed I'm here.

She has her elegant fingers on her thighs, and she's just staring at the keys.

It's like I'm looking at a brittle and delicate glass doll.
％Ｂ
「Narusawa. What's wrong?」
Rikka
「Oh... 
Hino-kun. 

I was taking a bit of a break.」
％Ｂ
「Looks more like you've got a problem or something to me.」
Rikka
「Well aren't you blunt.」
％Ｂ
「'Cause if you've got a problem, then I wanna be there to help.」
％Ｂ
「I wanna be of use for you, kinda as thanks for helping me with my music stuff.」

Rikka
「...You've done more than enough to thank me.」
％Ｂ
「Huh? What's that mean...?」
Rikka
「Nothing. Well... Yes, I do have a problem.」
But she doesn't say anything else.
Our shadows grow longer in the sunset-lit classroom.
％Ｂ
「You free after this?」
Rikka
「I am...」
％Ｂ
「There's somewhere I wanna go. Could you come with me?」

Narusawa and I agree to meet up at the gates afterward, and I leave to carry the boards to the second chemistry classroom.

We end our work for the day soon after that, and I part ways with the others.

Narusawa's waiting at the gates, as we agreed.
She's really something. All she's doing is just standing there by the gates, but the scene still looks picturesque.

％Ｂ
「Thanks for waiting. Let's go.」
Rikka
「Where are we going?」
％Ｂ
「You'll see when we get there.」
Rikka
「...The beach?」
％Ｂ
「Hahaha. Man, there's no one here at all.」
The beach is yet to be opened for swimming, so it's completely empty.
％Ｂ
「Well, no point in just standing here. How about we sit over there?」
Rikka
「...」
all
I find a spot with dry sand and sit down, and Narusawa sits beside me.
I stare out at the ocean.
％Ｂ
「Don't you think the ocean's pretty relaxing?」
Rikka
「What do you mean?」
％Ｂ
「The sound of the waves has this constant rhythm, right? It's kinda reassuring.」

Rikka
「...I think I understand what you mean.」
％Ｂ
「There was this time when I got in a fight with my mom and left the house.」

％Ｂ
「I don't even remember why we got in a fight. Probably something stupid.」
％Ｂ
「Anyway, so I ran out of my house, sure, but where to after that? If I went to a friend's place, then she'd just call them and I'd be dragged back, right? I didn't want that.」
％Ｂ
「But your parents know who your friends are or where you can go when you're a kid. There wasn't anywhere I could go, so...」

Rikka
「You ended up here?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. I was yelling about how stupid my mom was and stuff at first, but I slowly calmed down while I was listening to the waves.」

％Ｂ
「I guess you could say I made peace with things. As much as a kid could, anyway. I realized I was in the wrong too and stuff.」

Rikka
「Did you apologize?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. I somehow managed to get home on my own. I thought I was gonna get yelled at, but she hugged me and cried instead. I remember I was real surprised.」


Rikka
「You have a nice mother. I'm a little jealous.」
She speaks quietly, still looking out toward the ocean.
Rikka
「Hey
, Hino-kun.
.
」
She finally looks at me.
Her gentle smile sucks me in.
％Ｂ
「Hm?」
Rikka
「Thank you...」
％Ｂ
「You're very welcome.」
Rikka
「You see... I'm not confident about my piano playing.」
％Ｂ
「Why not? You're so good...」
Rikka
「Everyone says that. You, Segawa-san, Shinozaki-san, Okihara-senpai, Ousaka-san, Yukimura-san...」
Rikka
「...But I'm not confident... Because I couldn't even be a frog in a well.」

The sound of the waves swallows up the sadness in her voice.
Rikka
「Okihara-senpai and Ousaka-san both want someone like me to play piano for them... Even though it's such an important display for them.」
Rikka
「I can't help but feel doubts... like if it's really okay for me to be the one to do this.」
％Ｂ
「...」
％Ｂ
「Don't put yourself down like that. If you do that, then what am I supposed to think of myself when I'm tone-deaf?」

Rikka
「I'm sorry.」
％Ｂ
「It would've been nice if you didn't apologize seriously in response to that...」
％Ｂ
「Look, Okihara-senpai and Ousaka asked you 'cause you're you. You get that, right?」

Rikka
「...Yes, I do. I understand that the two of them expect a lot from me. That's exactly why I...」

％Ｂ
「Hmm～ ...I don't think you're right about that.」
Rikka
「Wha...?」
％Ｂ
「It's not about whether they expect something from you or not. What they want is your piano playing, pure and simple.」

Rikka
「My piano playing, pure and simple...」
％Ｂ
「It means you're the only one for them. Nothing else works. It's gotta be your piano playing, Narusawa.」

％Ｂ
「I guess what that also means, is that they don't want piano playing that you've twisted around and forced into something else just to live up to their expectations.」

Rikka
「...」
％Ｂ
「...I'm sorry.」
Rikka
「Why are you apologizing?」
％Ｂ
「Everyone was there when we brought this up originally. It was kinda hard to refuse, wasn't it?」

％Ｂ
「I didn't check to see if you were okay with it either. I just wanted you to play.」

％Ｂ
「So if you really don't want to, then you don't have to. I won't pressure you or get mad at you about it, and neither will anyone else.」

Rikka
「...」
％Ｂ
「...Anyway, let's wrap up the talking around here―let's have fun!」
Rikka
「Wha... Huh? Have fun with what?」
％Ｂ
「Duh, the ocean! You gotta have fun when you're feeling down!」

all
I throw my shoes and socks off and roll up my pants.
I start running.
％Ｂ
「Uoooooohhhhh! The oceaaaaaaaaaann!!」
Splashsplashsploosh～～!
％Ｂ
「Aaaaahhhh! That's cold! It's still super cold!」
Rikka
「Hehe... It hasn't been too long since we came to collect fish. Of course it's cold, the beach isn't open for swimming yet.」
％Ｂ
「Here. You too, Narusawa.」
I hold my hand out to her.
Rikka
「Geez... Hehe.」
She laughs in amusement and also takes off her shoes and socks.
She takes my hand.
I lead her into the water.
Rikka
「It's cold...」
Rikka
「But it feels nice.」
％Ｂ
「Right?」
Her smile shines brighter than the setting sun reflecting off the water to me.
Rikka
「The ocean... It's sparkling. It's so pretty...」
％Ｂ
「I think...」
...No, this is just way too embarrassing to say out loud.
Rikka
「Hm? What?」
％Ｂ
「Nothing. Yeah, pretty.」
Both the ocean and Narusawa.
Rikka
「I think we can go a little further out. Let's try going.」
％Ｂ
「Be careful. It gets deeper all of a sudden in some spots.」
Rikka
「I'll end up soaked again if that happens... Will you save me again?」

％Ｂ
「Yeah. With everything I've got. Though I hope it doesn't have to come to that.」

Rikka
「I don't want to go home soaking wet either. I don't think there are any dryers here this time either.」

Rikka
「...But I think... it might be okay to get a little wet.」
％Ｂ
「Agh!? There's water in my pants!? My bad, what'd you say just now?」

Rikka
「No, it's nothing～ Hehe...」
She smiles happily and pulls on my hand.
％Ｂ
「There's water! There's water coming in! It's already up to my knees! My pants are gonna get soaked!」

Rikka
「...Do you have short legs or something?」
％Ｂ
「You're so mean!! You're just the one with the modellike proportions!」
Rikka
「Hehe, I'm sorry. It was a joke. I think you're very good-looking. And you're cool on the inside too...」

％Ｂ
「Wha...!? Wha, wha, wha!?」
Rikka
「Why are you so surprised?」
％Ｂ
「'Cause I've never been complimented like that before.」
Rikka
「Really? Hehe... That makes me happy.」
Rikka
「...Because that means I'm the first one to tell you what's good about you.」
I don't really get why she's so happy.
But seeing Narusawa happy makes me happy.
We come to a stop in a spot that's a bit deeper than earlier.
I can feel the tiny sand particles tickling the soles of my feet.
Rikka
「The sun's setting...」
As if it were hiding itself below the horizon.
The sky's a mixture of orange and indigo. The stars have begun to glitter above. It's like something out of a dream.
％Ｂ
「Lalalalalalala, lalalalalalala.」

Rikka
「"Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star"?」
％Ｂ
「I thought it kinda fit with this scene.」
％Ｂ
「So I tried performing it with the instrument I'm most familiar with.」
Rikka
「Oh...! ...Hehe... But your pitch was off.」
％Ｂ
「This is the kinda scene where you should ignore stuff like that, you know.」
Rikka
「Hehe... I'm sorry. But, it sounded like you were having a lot of fun.」
That's probably because I'm here together with Narusawa...
Rikka
「I wonder if I could perform it the same way you did...」
％Ｂ
「You can do it. I know you can.」
Rikka
「...」
She inhales...
And I feel like the atmosphere around her changes.
Rikka
「Lalalalalalala, lalalalalalala.」

Her voice is as high as the sky above...
And as deep as the ocean below...
Rikka
「Lalalalalalala, lalalalalalala.」

It carries far... far out to the horizon.
Fascinating all the world without dissipating.
Rikka
「Lalalalalalala, lalalalalalala.」

Reality returns.
The sound of the waves resumes.
Rikka
「...」
She exhales.
I move to applaud, but I realize we're still holding hands.
％Ｂ
「Your voice was really pretty! And I could feel that you were having fun too!」

Rikka
「Mhm... Even I'm surprised.」
Rikka
「...I'll try playing... Because it's for Okihara-senpai and Ousaka-san's important display.」

％Ｂ
「If you've decided, then I'll help.」
Rikka
「...Thank you.」
Rikka
「...」
Rikka
「...Um, Hino-kun... I... think I... Oh...」
Rikka
「...Um... I... think I... Oh...」
Her face takes on the colors of the sunset when she sees our hands.
It's a vivid red, as if she were painted by the rays of the sun.
Rikka
「We've been holding hands this whole time.」
％Ｂ
「Guess we have. Uh... I should probably let go, right?」
Of course I should.
Narusawa and I are just friends. We're not dating.
But I don't want to.
％Ｂ
「...」
I wring out just a tiny bit of courage.
The courage to move forward.
％Ｂ
「...If it's all right with you, could we stay like this a little longer?」
I squeeze her hand... I want her to know that I don't want to let go.
Rikka
「It's gotten a little cold.」
％Ｂ
「Huh? Y-Yeah... You're right, it has. It's almost summer, but I guess it's still cold in the mornings and nights...」

Rikka
「My hand is just a bit cold too. So...」
Squeeze...
She grips my hand back.
Her hand is really warm, and really soft.
％Ｂ
「...」
Rikka
「...」
We stand there, watching the sun disappear beyond the horizon.

With the brightest stars in the sky watching over us.
