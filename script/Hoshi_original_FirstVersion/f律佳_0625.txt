「She's late...」
She's usually here by now...
I'm sitting with my chin in my hand, staring at the desk next to me.
Natsuki
「Waiting for Rikka?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah... Wait, Segawa!?」
Natsuki
「Rikka's not coming today. She says she's not feeling well.」
％Ｂ
「She got a cold or something?」
Natsuki
「Mmm～ ...Something kinda like that, but kinda not like that.」
％Ｂ
「The heck's that mean?」
Natsuki
「Why don't you ask her yourself if you're so curious?」
all
％Ｂ
「Guess I will...」
I navigate to the relevant app.
【％Ｂ】「I heard from Segawa you #Naren't feeling well. #NYou okay?」
She responds immediately.
【Rikka】「...She told you?」
...She told me?
Was she not supposed to tell me?
【％Ｂ】「She did. Is there an #Nissue with that?」
【Rikka】「It's more like why #Nwould she say it... I #Ntold her not to...」
【％Ｂ】「Huh? Wait, are you #Nreally sick or #Nsomething?」
【Rikka】「No. I'm fine. It would #Nbe nice if you wouldn't #Ntalk to others about #Nthis very much.」
Is it 'cause she doesn't wanna make people worry?
【％Ｂ】「Sure, but are you #Nreally okay?」
【Rikka】「I'm fine...」
She says she's fine, and I probably shouldn't cause her too much grief when she's sick.

【％Ｂ】「Got it. I'll take notes #Non what we do in class #Ntoday, so I'll show you #Nthose later. Get well #Nsoon.」
【％Ｂ】_st_0308
【Rikka】「...Thank you.」
$$smh_OpenCHK
Natsuki
「How was it?」
％Ｂ
「She says she's fine. But you know, it's rare for Narusawa to not be here, so...」
all
I hope she's okay.
Colds can get pretty bad if they get out of hand.
But why would she catch a cold at this point...?
Did she do something that would make her...
％Ｂ
「...The ocean?」
I made Narusawa walk through the sea the day before yesterday, even though it was still cold.
That might be the reason why...
Or more like that's the only reason I can think of.
So then that means that it's my fault that she's sick...?
And Narusawa lives alone on top of that.
There's no one to look after her.
Natsuki
「What are you looking so pale for? Rikka says it isn't a big deal, so you don't need to worry.」


％Ｂ
「Segawa. Wanna come visit her with me?」
Natsuki
「Excuse me? Were you even listening to what I just said?」
％Ｂ
「I think I might be the reason why she's not here today.」
Natsuki
「No way. Nope, not a chance.」
％Ｂ
「How do you know that for sure?」
Natsuki
「Well... I guess I could see her not coming to school and stuff because of you.」

Natsuki
「But anyway, this isn't something you need to visit her over... Oh. Mmfufu, why don't you go by yourself if you're that worried?」

％Ｂ
「Go by myself? ...There's no way it's okay for a guy to go alone, right?」
Natsuki
「Are you planning on assaulting her?」
％Ｂ
「I'm not gonna do that!」
What kinda scumbag would I be, assaulting a sick person!?
Natsuki
「It's fine then. We'd be a nuisance if we showed up in a big group, so you can go as our representative.」

Natsuki
「In a nutshell, don't think about it too much. Do you wanna go or not? Pick one!」
all
...And so I decided to go visit Narusawa alone.
I let Shuuichi know I wouldn't be able to do committee work today, and I told Okihara-senpai and the others that I wouldn't be able to help them today too.

They sent me off with big smiles, telling me to let her know that they hope she gets well soon...

I buy the standard fruit gifts, as well as the ingredients for making rice porridge.

I press the button for Narusawa's suite on the apartment complex's intercom.

Rikka
『Yes?』
％Ｂ
「Narusawa? It's ％Ａ. I'm here to visit.」
Rikka
『Hyah, wha...!? Wh-Why are you here...?』
％Ｂ
「What do you mean why? 'Cause I'm worried, obviously.」
Rikka
『Uuuuhh～ ...Why are you worried... I told you I was fine...』

％Ｂ
「Sorry. But you don't have anyone looking after you 'cause you live alone, right? So...」

Rikka
『...Is it just you?』
％Ｂ
「Yeah.」
Silence.
She might not like the fact that it's just one guy alone here to see her.
But then the door opens.
Rikka
『Come in. Wait a bit in front of the door.』
I take the elevator up to her floor, and wait for a while in front of the door.

I hear a clack as the door's unlocked, and it opens.
Rikka
「...」
Narusawa's wearing her casual clothes when she motions me in.
She might've wanted me to wait so she could have time to change.

Yeah, being in pajamas in front of other people's kinda embarrassing.
％Ｂ
「How do you feel? I brought fruits, and stuff to make rice porridge with.」
Rikka
「Why did you come...?」
％Ｂ
「I already told you, didn't I? I was worried.」
Rikka
「I'm grateful for that... but why did it have to be you of all people... Stupid Segawa-san.」

％Ｂ
「Are you really that against me coming?」
Rikka
「...I'm against it because it's you. Sigh...」
Her face is red, and she looks unsteady.
She might have a fever...
％Ｂ
「I'm sorry. I'll go home right away if you don't want me here.」
Rikka
「Oh... Um, I didn't mean it that way...」
％Ｂ
「You don't feel good, right? You should lie down. You don't look too steady.」
Rikka
「This is... Um, it's not what you think.」
％Ｂ
「What are you even talking about? Come on, just lie down.」
Rikka
「Geez... Sigh, fine.」
She sighs exasperatedly and sits down on the couch after I get a little forceful with my request.

％Ｂ
「Have you checked if you have a fever?」
Rikka
「...Why on earth would I have one? It really isn't something worth worrying about. It's just that this month's was a bit worse than usual...」


％Ｂ
「What!? You catch colds every month!? Are you really that frail!?」

Rikka
「Wha... Colds?」
％Ｂ
「Huh? Is that wrong?」
We both look blankly at each other in surprise.
％Ｂ
「Wha... Wait, is it something more serious? If it's every month, then it's some kinda chronic disease or...」

Rikka
「Wa...Wait, no... No, that's not... That's not what's...」
％Ｂ
「But if it's bad enough you have to stay home from school every month...」
Rikka
「～～～Uuuuhh... cramps.」
％Ｂ
「Huh?」
Rikka
「...It-It's period cramps! I stayed home from school because my stomach hurt!」
％Ｂ
「Pe...riod... cramps...?」
Rikka
「...Mhm.」
She turns so red that I feel sorry for her, and nods.

My face must be just as red.
I'm struck dumb. Those words are too much for a guy.
Rikka
「Um... you see. I thought Segawa-san told you the reason I wasn't at school today... I'm sorry I said such terrible things...」


Uhh... So wait, what?
Narusawa's face was red and she was acting weird 'cause she thought I knew that she was having her period...

Oh, I get it... Segawa's reactions from this morning make sense now.
So I just thought she had a cold or something on my own.
％Ｂ
「O-Oh, okay... I think I should apologize. Uh, I guess you don't need any rice porridge if you don't have a cold or anything.」

Rikka
「Oh... Still, um... could you make me some? I've been lying down all day, so I haven't eaten anything...」

％Ｂ
「S-Sure. I'll borrow the kitchen, then.」
Rikka
「O-Okay. You can use whatever you want.」
all
How embarrassing! How embarrassing! How embarrassing! How embarrassing! How embarrassing!

I bury my face in a couch cushion as ％Ａ-kun makes rice porridge for me in the kitchen.

I can't believe ％Ａ-kun found out that I was on my period, of all things!
He's the last person I would've wanted to find out.
Rikka
「Uuuh... I wonder... what he thought...」
...I hope he doesn't think anything of it.
Rikka
「But I wouldn't want that either...」
Because that would mean he's not interested in me at all...
I hear a LIME message come in on my phone.
【Natsuki】「How are you feeling? #N％Ａ apparently went #Nto go visit you. He #Ndidn't assault you, did #Nhe? Don't worry, I #Ndidn't tell him about #Nyour period～」
...I'm so sorry, Segawa-san. I've already self-destructed.
％Ｂ
「Narusawaaa. You want pickled plum?」
Rikka
「Y-Yesh! Y-Yes... please.」
％Ｂ
「Suuure thing.」
Rikka
「Hahhh... Him calling out to me so suddenly scared me.」
It's kind of strange knowing that there's a boy my age making food in my kitchen.

Meguru's the only one other than me who's stood there.
I can't stop myself from dreamily watching him from behind as he focuses on cooking.

He's cooking. For me.
％Ｂ
「Hottt!」
Rikka
「Are you okay!? Did you burn yourself!?」
％Ｂ
「No worries, I'm fine. I just accidentally touched the pot.」
％Ｂ
「You can relax and rest. Um... I don't really know about this stuff 'cause I'm a guy... but it hurts a lot, right?」


Rikka
「Mm...hm. Thank you...」
This time, I'm more happy than embarrassed.
Because I can feel his kindness in his words. I know that he's honestly worried about me.
Rikka
「...I might really have a fever now.」
My forehead feels comfortably warm against my hand.
$$smh_OpenCHK
Rikka
「Fhhh... Fhhh... Hafh...」
She scoops up the steaming hot rice porridge, blows on it to cool it down, and spoons it into her mouth.

Her pale throat moves a little as she swallows.
％Ｂ
「How is it? I taste-tested it, so I don't think it's inedible, but still.」

I'm worried. I've never made food for someone else before.
Rikka
「It's good. It has a gentle flavor.」
％Ｂ
「Really. I'm glad.」
％Ｂ
「I'll go do some washing up then, so take your time eating.」
Rikka
「I can at least clean up.」
％Ｂ
「Let me take care of everything today, since I'm here. Cleanup's part of cooking too, you know?」

Narusawa thinks for a bit, smiles tenderly, and nods.
Rikka
「Then could you?」
％Ｂ
「Sure thing. Leave it to me.」
Rikka
「Fhhh... Fhhh... Hafh, hafh...」
She resumes eating the rice porridge as I head back toward the kitchen.
all
％Ｂ
「I'll head home now, then.」
I put on my shoes at the doorway.
Narusawa's here to see me off.
％Ｂ
「I got you some grapefruits and stuff and put them on your table, so you can eat those once you're feeling better if you want.」

Rikka
「Thank you for today. I'm happy you came to visit me.」
％Ｂ
「Though it was all 'cause I misunderstood.」
Rikka
「But it still made me really happy.」
％Ｂ
「I'll see you at school, then.」
Rikka
「Mhm. See you.」
％Ｂ
「Oh...」
I can just slightly smell the salt of the sea.
The sea reflects the setting sun off in the distance.
I suddenly crave the scent of citrus fruit.
％Ｂ
「I think I'll buy some oranges or something on the way home.」
I walk away from Narusawa's apartment complex.
％Ｂ
「Phew... That wind feels nice.」
I open the window after getting out of the bath. The comfortably cool nighttime breeze plays across my flushed face.

It's been about a month since I've come back to Shionagi.
It feels like it's been a lot longer than that.
Living alone for the first time is nice because no one tells me what to do, but there are a lot of hard things too.
But thanks to that, I've become able to cook a little.
％Ｂ
「I was able to make Narusawa that rice porridge today thanks to that.」
Thinking about it that way makes the effort to learn that kinda housework worth it.

％Ｂ
「Narusawa... huh.」
I've met a lot of new people, and seen some familiar faces... but the fact that I've met Narusawa is especially important to me now.

She's beautiful and has a nice figure, of course.
But what's really attractive about her is something else...
She's bashful, she's nice, she's really cute when she smiles and laughs...
I learn something new about her every day, and every little thing draws me to her all the more.
％Ｂ
「Nothing's gonna change if I don't tell her how I feel...」
I wonder how she'd respond if I confessed.
Would she accept?
％Ｂ
「Hm? Oh, LIME.」
【Rikka】「Good evening. Are you #Nstill awake?」
【％Ｂ】「I'm awake.」
【Rikka】「I'm glad.」
She's glad. Did something happen?
【Rikka】「I ate those fruits #nafterward too. They #Nwere good. Thank you.」
【％Ｂ】「You're very welcome.」
【Rikka】「I just wanted to tell #Nyou that. I'm sorry for #Ncontacting you so late #Nat night.」
【％Ｂ】「It's fine. I wasn't #Nplanning on sleeping #Nyet anyway.」
【Rikka】「What were you doing?」
【％Ｂ】「Studying a bit.」
No way I could tell her I was thinking about her.
【Rikka】「Final exams are soon, #Nso that makes sense.」
【％Ｂ】「Right.」
...Are they?
This'll be my first time taking exams at this school.
I'll need to look into that later.
【Rikka】「I'm sorry for bothering #Nyou while you were #Nstudying. Thank you for #Neverything today. Good #Nnight.」
【Rikka】_st_0103
％Ｂ
「Oh...」
I think this might be the first time Narusawa's sent me a stamp.
It's not that big a deal, but I'm weirdly happy.
【％Ｂ】「Good night.」
【％Ｂ】_st_0216
$$smh_OpenCHK
I'm so happy about our casual conversation that I reread the LIME conversation over and over.

I'm wide awake. I don't think I'll be able to sleep for a while.
％Ｂ
「...I guess I'll prepare for what we'll cover in class tomorrow.」
