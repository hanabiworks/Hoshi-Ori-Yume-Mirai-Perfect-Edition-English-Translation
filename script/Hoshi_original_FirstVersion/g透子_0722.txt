We're relaxing after lunch.
We're taking it even easier than usual today, after the dizzying amount of work we had this morning.

％Ｂ
「Crap... I kinda don't wanna move anymore...」
Touko
「What a coincideeence, I was just thinking the same thing... I think I'll settle into my usual spot, then...」

Damn you for barging in when it was getting good...

「Hello? What is it?」
Shuuichi
『Sorry, but I need you to help the swimming club. This suits you perfectly.』
％Ｂ
「What? What's that mean?」
Shuuichi
『You'll understand once you're there. They're working on the grounds. I need you there as soon as possible. Counting on you.』

％Ｂ
「Agh, hey...!」
_smh_st_04
Touko
「Was that Four-Eyes-kun? Did he ask you to do something?」
％Ｂ
「The swimming club's apparently got something they need us to do. He said it'd suit me perfectly...」

Touko
「I'll come with. I need to take a bit of a walk after eating.」
％Ｂ
「...Very refined of you, Touko.」
We've come down to the grounds.
I'm very much lost on what to do after spotting the group standing a little ways away from us.

％Ｂ
「Why is it all girls...? And why are they all wearing swimsuits...!?」

The extremely surreal sight of girls wearing competitive swimwear out on the school grounds.
It's kinda hard to call out to them.
％Ｂ
「Sorry, Touko, but could you go and ask them what they want?」
Touko
「Huh? Why?」
％Ｂ
「It's hard for a guy to just walk into a scene like that. All I need you to do is ask if they really did want me there.」


Touko
「Whaaat? ...That's a pain. You're too worried.」
％Ｂ
「Please, Touko! I'll buy you two desserts on our next date!」

Touko
「Geez, fiiine... I'll do it, for three.」

...That's one more than I offered.
I worry for my wallet as I watch Touko walk over to the swimming club.

％Ｂ
「...She's taking a while.」
It's been about ten minutes since she went over to the swimming club.
It's pretty rough just standing still out here because of the sun overhead.

I peer over at them.
_00cutinBS
I see three swimsuited swimming club members pressing Touko.
％Ｂ
「What...? Did something happen?」
Are they arguing? ...I don't think so.
It doesn't seem particularly tense.
I think I might be able to hear what they're saying if I got a little closer...
Swimming Club Member A
「What do you think you're doing?」
_00cutinBS
％Ｂ
「Huh?」
Swimming Club Member A
「Watching them like that... Everyone! There's a pervert watching you guys!」

Excuse me!?
Am I the pervert!?
The swimming club members and Touko look toward me.
The eyes of the swimsuited girls immediately become hostile, and they start whispering to each other.

I may not be able to hear what they're saying, but I can pretty much guess.
I need to clear up this misunderstanding immediately, or else my life at school's going to crash and burn!

Swimming Club Member A
「I'm not letting you escape! Come here with me!」
％Ｂ
「N-No...! Let me explain!」
Swimming Club Member A
「Sorry, sorry. I thought you were peeping on us. But it's your fault too for acting so suspicious, you know.」

I was able to explain things to the swimming club.
As for Touko, who's supposed to be on my side here...
Touko
「Ahahahahahahah! Hahh... M-My stomach hurts...! Th-They thought you were a pervert... Ahahahahah!」

％Ｂ
「...Touko. I'd appreciate it if you could quiet down a little.」
Touko
「I-I can't! ...Ahahahahah! I've never seen you freak out like that before...! Ahahahah!」


Of course I was freaking out. I was being labeled as a pervert.
Though I can understand why they might think that...
all
It seems like the swimming club members were trying to recruit Touko again.

They were also asking for details on her relationship with me, and that's around when I got dragged in.

Touko
「Ahh, you really saved me. Thank you, Pervert-kun... Ahahahah!」

％Ｂ
「...Shut up.」
all
Swimming Club Member A
「We haven't given up, okay? Yukimura-san has amazing athletic talent. And she's pretty, and her boobs are big.」

...Do those last two things have anything to do with this?
I guess her boobs make her float better or something?
Swimming Club Member A
「Having someone you admire nearby can get you motivated to work harder. That figure of hers is cheating.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, but you'd have to get her to wanna do it in the first place. I doubt you'll be able to.」
Swimming Club Member A
「Agh, that's so "I understand Yukimura-san"! I'm so jealous!」

Swimming Club Member B
「Riiight!? Maybe I should go for it during the Tanabata Festival too! Confessing with momentum from the festival's okay, right!?」

Swimming Club Member A
「Wait a second, you can't get a boyfriend by yourself! That's unfair! I want a nice and cool boy who's about 180 centimeters tall ask me to be with him!」


Swimming Club Member B
「You're aiming too high. Didn't you say you like that upperclassman in the baseball club?」

Swimming Club A
「...He's apparently started dating the club manager.」
...Girls' talk has started up.
They seem to have forgotten my existence.
Touko
「Hahh... Hahh... Oh geez, that was a lot of laughing. You looked like you were about to cry when those girls came up to you. It was so cute.」


％Ｂ
「...This is why I didn't wanna do this.」
Touko
「Now, now. Don't sulk. We're here for work, aren't we? Let's get started, club president!」

all
Swimming Club Member A
「Oh, right. Sorry about that. We got a little carried away. It's hard for us to stop chatting once we get started.」

％Ｂ
「Shuuichi... The event committee chair said I was suited for this job, but what'd he mean by that?」

Swimming Club Member A
「I asked for a boy to help us. Because it's hard for just us to do this.」

％Ｂ
「A boy...? There are guys in the swimming club, aren't there?」
Swimming Club Member A
「No! We're settling things with them at the Tanabata Festival! How could we ask for help from the enemy!?」


...It sounds like there's a potentially annoying side to what's going on here.
I doubt I'll need to know the details to help them, so let's just get back on subject.

％Ｂ
「So what did you want me to...?」
Swimming Club Member A
「They use the courses on the girls' side without asking, and they never clean up the equipment afterward! And they're always whispering about which one of us has bigger boobs or how one of us got fat!」


Swimming Club Member B
「And the way they look at us is so perverted! But they always just act tough and say they're not interested! We know they're always staring at our butts and boobs!」


...Note to self. Be careful in the future.
Make sure to look girls properly in the eyes when I speak with them.
...Don't look at me like that, Touko!
all
Swimming Club Member A
「You're good at this kind of stuff, aren't you!? Help us!」

％Ｂ
「What the heck do you want me to do!? You need to explain it properly!」

Swimming Club Member B
「We need help putting up a festival stand. We're going to do aprons over swimsuits like at a beach house, but we have no idea how to build the actual stand.」


％Ｂ
「Oh, I get it.」
That explains why I was picked for this.
So the problem is getting materials... and the labor required to actually put it all together.
Swimming Club Member A
「Could you tell us how to make one? Something simple's fine. We have lots of materials, and I think we'll be able to manage as long as we know how to do it.」


So then I'll just need to oversee the process for a day.
That should be doable today.
％Ｂ
「Then there's something I want you all to do first.」
Swimming Club Member B
「Anything! We'll work hard if it'll help us win against the boys!」

％Ｂ
「...Change into jerseys. It'd be terrible if someone got hurt, and I don't know where I'm supposed to look when you're all dressed like this.」

Swimming Club Member A
「Hey, so what kinda confession did you get from him!? Was it a head-on "Go out with me!" thing!?」


Swimming Club Member B
「How far have you two gone!? You haven't already done dirty stuff together, have you!?」

Touko
「A-Ahaha... I don't really remembeeer...?」
Seeing Touko signal me for help with her eyes pains me.
But I'd probably only make things worse by jumping into that conversation.

Swimming Club Member A
「And he seems so nice! I actually saw the two of you out shopping together!」

Swimming Club Member B
「Oh, I've seen that too! Yukimura-san was feeding him a crêpe, and he was blushing so much!」

Swimming Club Member A
「What the heck!? Why didn't you tell me about that until now!? Yukimura-san, I have to hear more!」

Touko
「I-I think it might just be a case of mistaken identity? We're indoor people, you know. Because I'll melt out in the sun.」

Swimming Club Member B
「You don't have to hide it! Let us dream a little too!」
Swimming Club Member A
「Ahh... I want a boyfriend toooo! I wanna do embarrassing stuff like Yukimura-san doooes!」

Well excuse us for being embarrassing!
It's actually pretty easy to get used to it once you start!
all
Swimming Club Member A
「Hey, could I ask you a question?」

Seems they're finally in the mood to get to work.
I need to do what I can to help, since I was asked to handle this.
％Ｂ
「Sure thing. What is it?」
Swimming Club Member A
「Have you and Yukimura-san... had sex already?」
％Ｂ
「Get to work alreadyyy!」
Shuuichi
「Oh, the pervert's back.」
％Ｂ
「Who are you calling a pervert!? You... Wait a second, how do you know about that?」
Shuuichi
「Just what do you think this room is? The event committee office is the place where all information across the school converges.」

Don't say it like it's a covert ops agency or something.
I'm gonna end up a bit impressed.
Shuuichi
「Heard you were peeping on girls wearing swimsuits? When Yukimura was with you too... It's the tragic saga of man.」

％Ｂ
「Stop it, dumbass! I wasn't peeping! I was just worried 'cause Touko took so long, and...」

Touko
「And you got curious about the girls' butts?」
％Ｂ
「...」
Touko
「Ahahahah! I'm kidding, don't be mad!」
％Ｂ
「Whatever. Even Touko doesn't believe me. I'm going to just live out the rest of my dismal life at school branded as a pervert.」


Shuuichi
「...You're a real pain, you know that?」
Information propagates at a terrifying rate.
The entire school's gonna know by tomorrow at this rate...
Shuuichi
「It's because you two stand out. There are actually a lot of people talking about you, you know.」

％Ｂ
「...Are there? I kinda doubt it.」
Shuuichi
「You're already a talking point because you're both transfer students. Plus, Yukimura's real pretty.」

Touko
「Mmm... Being complimented by you doesn't really make me happy or anything, but I guess I should at least be grateful. Thanks.」

Shuuichi
「...Why does she treat me like this?」
％Ｂ
「Like I know.」
Shuuichi
「And it isn't just the students either. You two are famous among the teachers too.」
％Ｂ
「What? Wh-Why?」
Shuuichi
「Because you two are always together. Of course they'd notice. You should be careful. The more conservative teachers apparently don't think too highly of it.」


I never really thought about it that much.
How my relationship with Touko would affect our surroundings.
We've been making much larger waves than we thought.
I'm sure those waves are going to affect us too, and change our relationship bit by bit.

Shuuichi
「Oh, right. You two can have tomorrow off. Not like you'd listen if I told you to take a day off one at a time, right?」

Touko
「Nope. I'd never come if you told me to work by myself.」

Shuuichi
「I made sure you're off on the same day. I hope you're grateful to me for your day off together. Get me something as a souvenir.」

Touko
「Mmm... Is shaved ice okay?」
Shuuichi
「It'll be a puddle by the time I get it! Why would I want slightly flavored lukewarm water!?」

Touko
「Why don't you just freeze it again? It'll probably turn into flavored shaved ice if you shave it after that.」

What an awful souvenir.
It's just harassment.
all
Touko
「What do you wanna do for our day off tomorrow?」
％Ｂ
「I haven't really thought about it... Is there anything you wanna do?」
Touko
「Mmm... I might wanna go shopping for a bit.」
％Ｂ
「Shopping? We just went on Sunday, though.」
Touko
「I know, but it's fun just looking around, isn't it? It'd make me happy if you came wiiith.」

％Ｂ
「Seriously... All right. Let's go out to town together tomorrow.」
Touko
「Mhm! I'm looking forward to it!」
