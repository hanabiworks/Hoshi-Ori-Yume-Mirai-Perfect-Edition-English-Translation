It's the weekend.
We need more fish to display in the additional tanks...
So we've come back to Urashima Island on Keizou-san's boat.
Keizou
「Here you go, kiddo. Take this.」
％Ｂ
「Urghhh!?」
It-It's heavy today, too...
Actually, I feel like there's more stuff to carry than last time.
Misa
「Thank you very much, Keizou-san.」
Keizou
「Anything for you, Misa-chan. This ain't anything.」

Keizou
「You wanted me to come pick you up in the evening, right?」
Misa
「Yes, please.」
Keizou
「Then I'll be heading back... but you better make sure you don't mix up the order of events, kiddo.」

％Ｂ
「I-I know...」
Keizou
「I'll be seeing you, then.」
Misa
「Order... Order of what?」
％Ｂ
「You know, he means... Like, not to let physical stuff come before the...」
Misa
「W-Well we don't have to worry about that, then. I'd like to think we let our hearts speak before becoming physical. Though we haven't... gone all the way... yet...」


％Ｂ
「Y-Yes, you're right. But... we should do things in order, shouldn't we?」
Misa
「Y-Yes! One step at a time... Ahaha...」
She smiles bashfully.
It's kinda funny seeing her get quiet like this when she's usually so full of energy.

％Ｂ
「Uh, then...」
Misa
「Y-Yes. Then... shall we start collecting?」

all
We somewhat awkwardly begin working.
I'm gonna be alone together with her until evening...
I feel like what Keizou-san said's only gotten me even more self-conscious...

％Ｂ
「Oh, you need to change, right? I'll look the other way.」

Misa
「There's no need. I'm wearing my swimsuit underneath, so there's nothing for me to be embarrassed about...」

all
She undoes the ribbon at her waist and starts taking off her dress.
I can catch glimpses of her pale skin between flutters of the fabric.
Misa
「Oh... A-Ahaha... This is actually more embarrassing than I expected.」

％Ｂ
「I-I'm sorry. I was staring.」
Misa
「Oh no, it's fine! It's completely fine...」
Misa
「Because I've already learned that men are very perverted...」

all
She slowly takes off her hat.
She's dazzling in her swimsuit.
Misa
「Okay... Sh-Shall we go?」
％Ｂ
「Y-Yes. I'll get changed right away too.」
all
I take off my clothes and get ready.
I'm not wearing much, so it takes no time at all.
％Ｂ
「I've got a camera today. I thought I could take some photos while I was helping you, since it's so pretty here.」

Misa
「Oh my, is it a waterproof camera?」
％Ｂ
「...Not exactly. Segawa told me that I could put a waterproof case on my smartphone. The photos apparently come out pretty nicely.」

Misa
「That's wonderful! I'd love it if you took lots of photos of the fish!」

％Ｂ
「You can leave that to me.」
We go over our hand signals again and go back into the sea.
I could forget all the quarrels of the world here.
There's nothing but a blue world, vibrant with life.
Misa-senpai twists her limbs as she swims through the ocean.
She's so pretty.
This must be what people imagined mermaid princesses to look like.
The fish gather around her again.
It's strange how not a single one comes near me.
I guess it means they can sense her love for them.
I point the camera toward her on reflex.
I press the shutter button.
...Yeah. That was a really great photo.
I think I'll take a few more while we're down here.
Whoops. Accidentally took a close-up of her cleavage.
She's gonna think I was just thinking dirty thoughts if she sees this.
Though that's not the case at all.
It's not the case... at all...
％Ｂ
「We've collected a lot.」
There are lots of different species of fish I've never seen before swimming in the cooler box.

Misa
「Collection went perfectly today. And we were lucky too.」
She's in a good mood from being able to collect some rare fish.
Her smile seems a lot brighter than the sunlight.
％Ｂ
「What's this seaweed?」
Misa
「That would be eelgrass. I collected some to add to the water tanks.」

％Ｂ
「Is this enough? Maybe we should collect some more while we're here?」

Misa
「No, it should be fine. We won't be placing the eelgrass in all of the tanks.」

％Ｂ
「Really?」
Misa
「Eelgrass is slightly difficult to cultivate. You need strong lighting if you wish to do it in a water tank.」


Misa
「Fluorescent lights will not be enough, so a tank with eelgrass will require separate lighting. It would be expensive to set up all of the tanks with that.」


％Ｂ
「I see.」
Misa
「We will be using red algae and sea lettuce in the other tanks, as we have already been doing.」

％Ｂ
「Is there anything else we should collect?」
Misa
「To be truthful, I would like to take much more back with us... but this is enough for now. Thank you very much for your help.」


％Ｂ
「Oh no, it was nothing... but that means we'll have the entire afternoon free.」

Misa
「You're right. Since Keizou-san will be picking us up in the evening...」
％Ｂ
「Then what should we do until then?」
Misa
「Ufufu... Shall we have ourselves a relaxing vacation?」
％Ｂ
「That sounds good! Let's enjoy this!」
Misa
「Yes! Then shall we start with lunch?」
％Ｂ
「Sounds great to me. I'm starving after all the swimming around we did this morning.」

％Ｂ
「Are we having curry again today? Where should we start?」

Misa
「Oh... Well, actually. You can take a break from preparing for today.」

％Ｂ
「What? But...」
Misa
「I've made boxed lunches today... as thanks for all you've done.」

％Ｂ
「You made... You mean...」
Misa
「I guess... you would say they're handmade?」
％Ｂ
「Ohhh!」
No way... Misa-senpai's handmade food...
I'm super excited!
Misa
「But I apologize. I'm not very skilled at cooking... and so it ended up being something very simple.」


％Ｂ
「I don't mind that. I'm sure that if you made it, it'll be delicious.」

Misa
「Thank you very much. Then, I'm embarrassed, but...」
all
She opens up one of the cooler boxes and takes out the boxed lunches.
It's an adorable-looking lunch that's wrapped in a handkerchief.
％Ｂ
「Is this a three-layer lunch?」
Misa
「Yes. And this... would be the first layer!」
all
％Ｂ
「It-It's...!」
As if the contents of a miniature aquarium were before me...
Misa
「Octopus-shaped sausage!」
It's packed full of impressively cut octopus-shaped sausages.

％Ｂ
「Wow, you've even given them mouths and faces...」
Misa
「The mouths are fish cake, and the eyes are dried seaweed.」
Misa
「The second layer is fried egg and fried chicken. Though they've fallen apart slightly...」

％Ｂ
「Not at all. They look delicious.」
Misa
「And lastly, rice balls! I thought it may be nice to have some saltiness after swimming so much...」

％Ｂ
「Wow! ...Wait... Huh?」

Misa
「Is something the matter?」
％Ｂ
「These rice balls... have a bit of a unique shape to them, don't you think?」
Misa
「Do they? I intended them to come out normal-shaped...」
％Ｂ
「They're kind of...」
Kinda like jellyfish or something...
％Ｂ
「B-But, they look great. Let's dig in.」
Misa
「Yes. I'll get some tea and chopsticks out.」
Misa
「...O-Oh?」
％Ｂ
「Is something wrong?」
Misa
「I-I'm sorry. I can't believe I... It appears I've neglected to bring more than one pair of chopsticks...」

％Ｂ
「Really? Do you have anything we could use instead, like a fork or...?」
Misa
「It doesn't appear so...」
％Ｂ
「Hmm...」
We have two lunches, and one pair of chopsticks.
And no one else is gonna be around this island until evening...
％Ｂ
「We can make do with just one set. We can trade off using them.」

Misa
「Y-Yes! Let's do that! You first, please.」

％Ｂ
「Okay then. I'll start with the sausage... Ohhh! These are great!」


Misa
「Are they really? I'm glad!」
％Ｂ
「The fish cake adds a nice extra flavor. This is amazing.」

Misa
「I'm very happy you like them so much. I'd also like some!」

％Ｂ
「Okay then, here you go.」
I hold one out for her.
Misa
「Oh...」
She freezes and goes bright red.
％Ｂ
「Oh, I-I'm...」
I'm holding out food to her with my chopsticks.
This is one of those "Say 'ahhh'" moments...
％Ｂ
「I-I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking... Uhh, I'll just hand you the chopsticks then.」

Misa
「Oh, n-no... Um... It certainly isn't unwelcome.」
Misa
「Please feed me... the octopus sausage...」
％Ｂ
「O-Okay. Then... say "ahhh."」
Misa
「Ahh...」
Her pale throat bobs as she chews.
I freeze up watching her for some reason.
Misa
「Oh, this is delicious!」
％Ｂ
「What are you saying? You made these yourself.」
Misa
「Because, because, I only tried them out a little.」
％Ｂ
「Would you like another one?」
Misa
「I would! Ahhh... Hamh, hamh... Ufufu...」

Misa
「I think it may taste even better when you feed them to me.」

％Ｂ
「Maybe? They say food's all about the emotions...」
Misa
「Yes. I feel that the love may be improving the flavor even further.」
Misa
「Um... May I... return the favor?」
％Ｂ
「Y-Yes, of course.」
I hand her the chopsticks.
Misa
「Ufufu... Truth be told, it isn't just octopus sausage in here.」

Misa
「Tadaaa! There are crab ones too.」
％Ｂ
「Ohh, wow!」
Misa
「Here... Say "ahhh!"」
％Ｂ
「Ahhh... Mgmgh...」
％Ｂ
「Ohhh, this is delicious!」
Misa
「The crab ones have cheese inside. There are also squid... These. "Ahh."」

％Ｂ
「Ahhh... And this one is all fish cake, isn't it?」
Misa
「Exactly!」
％Ｂ
「These are great. They make me want some rice.」
Misa
「Oh, then of course, you may have a rice ball.」
She gingerly grabs one by the seaweed-covered part and holds it out to me.
It's definitely kinda flat, isn't it?\n\r
Jellyfish rice balls... It doesn't surprise me at all, coming from her.
Misa
「Say "ahhh"!」
％Ｂ
「Mgmgh... nmh.」
Misa
「Ahahaha, you have some on your cheek. Stay still, please...」

She gently grabs the rice with her fingers.
Misa
「Mmh, chu...」
And licks it off her fingers, as if it were the most natural thing in the world.
％Ｂ
「Misa-senpai...」
Misa
「Oh! ...Ahh, I...」
Misa
「I feel I may have done something a little embarrassing...」

％Ｂ
「O-Oh, no! Not at all. It made me very happy.」

Misa
「I-Is that so?」
％Ｂ
「Yes! It isn't weird at all! It's a completely normal thing to do as lovers.」

％Ｂ
「You could probably even have gotten it with a kiss on the cheek.」
Misa
「A kiss on the cheek...」
％Ｂ
「Just as an example...」
Misa
「U-Umm.」
％Ｂ
「Yes?」
Misa
「I would also like... to eat a rice ball.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, okay... Here. "Ahh"...」
Misa
「A-Aahhh...」
She bites into it.
But the flattish rice ball's just a bit too big for her small mouth, and...

Misa
「Oh no, I've gotten some on my cheek...」
％Ｂ
「Y-Yes, you have... I'll get it off for you.」
Misa
「Y-Yes... Please do.」
I hold her softly by the shoulders and pull her closer.
％Ｂ
「Mm, chu...」
And gently kiss her on the cheek.
I lick the rice away as I do so.
Misa
「E-Eheheheeeh... It-It's embarrassing... but I'm also happy.」

She smiles. She looks embarrassed, but satisfied.
％Ｂ
「It tasted a little salty.」
Misa
「Oh, that may be the taste of the seawater...」
％Ｂ
「Well, we were in the water just earlier.」
Misa
「I see, I see... Then, um... May I try it as well?」

％Ｂ
「Yes, of course.」
Misa
「Then... Say "ahh."」
％Ｂ
「Ahhh... Mgmgh...」
Misa
「Hehe... You've gotten rice on your cheek again...」
Misa
「Mm, chu... Mlh... Mmlh...」
She licks my cheek so much it's a little ticklish.

Misa
「You're right. It is salty.」
％Ｂ
「It's the taste of the sea.」
Misa
「You're right. This isn't unpleasant, but...」
％Ｂ
「But?」
Misa
「I think I may prefer my kisses to be sweet.」
％Ｂ
「Hmm... Then shall we have a sweet kiss?」
Misa
「Y-Yes! I would be very interested in doing so!」
％Ｂ
「Then...」
Misa
「Y-Yes...!」
％Ｂ
「Mm, chu...」
Misa
「Mmmmh... Chu, mlh...」
Misa
「Pfh... hamh, chu... mmlh...」
We press our lips together tightly.
We wrap our tongues together and feel each other's body heat.
Misa
「That was... a very sweet kiss.」
She smiles dreamily.
Misa
「This is too wonderful for me to eat lunch...」
Misa
「Mmm, chu... mlh...」
all
Misa
「That was a delicious meal.」
The two of us clap our hands together after eating.
Misa
「I'm very glad you ate so much.」
％Ｂ
「It was crazy good... Though it did take us a while.」

Misa
「That would be because we were savoring something other than the food as well...」
We laugh.
It's a warm moment.
Misa
「Oh, I know. Please show me your photos.」
％Ｂ
「Okay. Here.」
I hand her my phone.
I took photos whenever I saw a good opportunity while we were collecting fish.
Misa
「How wonderful! These came out so nicely!」
Misa
「So many fish too... Oh, there's a bullhead shark!」
％Ｂ
「A shark? Was it okay that it was that close?」
Misa
「Yes, bullhead sharks are harmless. You can often find them in touching pools at aquariums.」

Misa
「But they still have sharp teeth. And see their blunt heads and ridged brows?」

％Ｂ
「Oh yes...」
Misa
「I also see a blacktip grouper... and this is a silver biddy, perhaps?」
Misa
「Also... Hmm...」
％Ｂ
「What is it?」
Misa
「I feel like there may be quite a few photos of me in here...」
％Ｂ
「Huh? D-Do you think so? I thought I was getting even amounts of both you and the fish...」

Misa
「Umm, I feel that there may be many close-ups of my face.」
％Ｂ
「I-Is... that so.」
％Ｂ
「The fish were pretty, but... you were still the prettiest thing to me.」

Misa
「The prettiest...」
Misa
「Then this photo of my boobs... was also because they were pretty?」

％Ｂ
「Uh... Th-That's because...」
Misa
「Was it just... coincidence?」
％Ｂ
「It... wasn't a coincidence.」
％Ｂ
「I caught sight of you, and all I could think was that you were pretty.」
％Ｂ
「And so I took the photo on reflex... I'm sorry.」

Misa
「Why are you apologizing?」
％Ｂ
「Because...」
Misa
「You took it... because you thought I was pretty, didn't you?」
％Ｂ
「...Yes.」
％Ｂ
「Because I thought... that you were really good-looking, like a mermaid.」

Misa
「...Hauh.」
Misa
「You see, I... My boobs are quite large, and so I consider myself slightly unshapely...」

％Ｂ
「Th-That's not true at all! As a man who's seen them in person...」

Misa
「Y-Yes?」
％Ｂ
「Your boobs are the prettiest in the whole world.」
Misa
「In the whole...」
％Ｂ
「Y-Yes.」
Misa
「...」
...Maybe I said too much.
But that's how I actually feel, so...
Oh, but she might not like being complimented like that...
Doubts like that fill my mind, but...
Misa
「I'm so happy!」
％Ｂ
「Wah!」
She hugs me tight.
Misa
「It's so wonderful to have you say things like that!」
％Ｂ
「W-Well, you're very welcome...!」
％Ｂ
「But, um, this position is...」
Misa
「What? Is something the matter?」
％Ｂ
「It's just, my head's... buried in your boobs, and...」
Misa
「A-Aahhh!?」
Misa
「I-I'm sorry... I was just so happy I...」
％Ｂ
「N-No, it was paradise.」
％Ｂ
「Because your boobs are big and soft... They're the best.」

Misa
「...Hehe.」
Misa
「Then... may I squeeze you tight one more time? I'll make sure it isn't uncomfortable for you this time.」

％Ｂ
「Y-Yes... Please do.」
Misa
「Then please excuse me...」
all
Misa
「Squeeeeze.」
％Ｂ
「Mm...」
Her soft boobs surround me.
I feel like I might go crazy from the comfort, the excitement, and more than anything else, the overwhelming softness...

Misa
「Oh... Ufufu...」
Our gazes meet, and we look into each other's eyes.
Her bright smile comforts my very soul.
I want to be with her even more.
％Ｂ
「Senpai...」
I squeeze her back tightly.
Misa
「Ahn...」
She wraps her arms around my back and places her cheek against mine.
I can feel the shape of her soft body. It's enough to make my crotch go hot.

％Ｂ
「You're so pretty in your swimsuit.」
Misa
「You were watching me lots... in my swimsuit, weren't you?」
％Ｂ
「Well I... Yes.」
Misa
「I was insecure about my large breasts... but my feelings on the matter have changed gradually thanks to all of your praise.」


Misa
「My heart fills up so much... when the person I love compliments me, especially since he's so cool. My heart goes tight when you're happy.」


％Ｂ
「Ahaha, I'm glad. Though I'm not that cool a boyfriend...」

Misa
「Oh no, you are. I believe you are the coolest person on Earth.」

She looks serious.
％Ｂ
「Thank you very much... That makes me very happy.」

％Ｂ
「And you're so pretty. The prettiest in the world... I think I might go crazy knowing that someone as pretty as you is my girlfriend.」


Misa
「O-Oh nooo... Ufufufufu...」
We both blush at each other's compliments.
％Ｂ
「Haha... We're kind of weird, aren't we? We're complimenting each other and getting embarrassed.」

Misa
「You're right... but this is very fun.」
She grips my hand tight.
％Ｂ
「Senpai. May I... touch your body more?」
Misa
「...Yes. Go ahead. I'd also like... to feel you lots.」
