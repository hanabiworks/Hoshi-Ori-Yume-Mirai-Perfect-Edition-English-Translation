Natsuki
「Marika! You're late!」
Marika
「Oh... Segawa-san! Wow～ It's been so long～!」
Natsuki
「It isn't just me. Everyone else is here already too.」
all
Rikka
「Oh? I thought Ousaka-san was here too...」

Touko
「She's probably over there. Look, by the sea stars.」

all
Natsuki
「Oh, you're right. Soraaa!」
all
Sora
「...What?」

Natsuki
「What are you doing over there?」
Sora
「...I was looking at the stars.」
all
Marika
「Ahaha～ ...Looks like you haven't changed.」
all
Rikka
「Still, people don't get married at aquariums that often.」


Touko
「It's apparently a new service they're offering starting today. Sounds fun.」

Rikka
「I guess today is Marine Day.」
Sora
「...Getting married at an aquarium on Marine Day... It sounds just like Misa and Ryou.」

Sora
「...Getting married at an aquarium on Marine Day... It sounds just like those two.」

Shuuichi
「To all guests, the ceremony will begin shortly. Please, come gather before the large water tank!」

Natsuki
「Is that... Nirasawa?」
Marika
「They said he was hosting the ceremony～! He said to go to the large tanks. Let's go everyone!」

all
Misa and I are standing in front of the large tank. A solemn melody plays around us.

Misa
「Today, the two of us will be declaring our marriage vows before all of you who have gathered here today.」

The guests were enjoying themselves earlier by looking at the tanks.
Now they've changed into their dress clothes.
Several of our friends smile at us.
Seeing all of them fills my heart.
％Ｂ
「Starting today, our hearts will be one.」
Misa
「We will care for each other, encourage each other, and support each other.」
We decided for our wedding to be a civil ceremony.
A unique ceremony that doesn't follow any particular structure.
The two of us will say our vows under the watchful eyes of the guests.
Misa and I felt like that fit us best.
％Ｂ & Misa
「From now on, the two of us will be together in life.」
％Ｂ
「I, ％Ｂ, vow to take Misa-san as my wife. I will share joy with her, overcome difficulty together with her hand in hand, hold unwavering love for her in my heart, and be her partner throughout the rest of our lives.」


Misa
「I, Misa, vow to take Ryousuke-san as my husband. I will share joy with him, overcome difficulty with him hand in hand, hold unwavering love for him in my heart, and be his partner throughout the rest of our lives.」


Misa
「I, Misa, vow to take this man as my husband. I will share joy with him, overcome difficulty with him hand in hand, hold unwavering love for him in my heart, and be his partner throughout the rest of our lives.」


％Ｂ
「We have vowed everlasting love for one another before all of you.」
Misa
「May we ask for your approval for the two of us being bound together as husband and wife?」

％Ｂ
「To show approval...」
Misa
「If you would please applaud!」
Thunderous applause answers her voice.
Everyone here approves of our wedding, and celebrates us.
I feel something surge up in me again at the fact.
Misa
「Thank you all so very much for your approval.」
％Ｂ
「We will not forget the vows we exchanged before you today, nor will we forget this celebration of our union...」

Misa
「And we vow to build a fun, happy... and very wonderful family together!」
Another round of applause.
Amidst the sounds of celebration and camera flashes...
We bask in our happiness.
Shuuichi
「These two have now become husband and wife in all respects. Let us all wholeheartedly send them our congratulations.」

Shuuichi
「Now then, the newlywed groom and bride would like to extend some words of gratitude for everyone attending today.」

I accept the microphone and turn toward our guests.
％Ｂ
「Err... I would like to thank you all from the bottom of my heart for taking the time out of your busy schedules to attend our ceremony today.」


％Ｂ
「I would also like to thank everyone for your heartfelt words of congratulations and warm encouragements for our marriage.」

％Ｂ
「As of today, Misa and I are united as wife and husband. I am deeply grateful to all of you for warmly watching over us.」


％Ｂ
「...Misa and I first met and started dating back in high school.」

％Ｂ
「And we first met here, at Marinpia Shionagi.」
％Ｂ
「I still remember that day very well. This place is a very important, very special place to me, in many ways.」


％Ｂ
「And I have had the pleasure of being deeply involved with Marinpia's reopening this year.」

％Ｂ
「And I also have the pleasure of marrying Misa in the same year, thus turning the page to a new chapter in my life.」

％Ｂ
「I'm very happy that I was able to experience yet another new beginning here at the Marinpia Shionagi I hold so dearly in my heart.」

％Ｂ
「And... I believe Misa may feel the same way.」
I hand her the microphone.
Misa
「As Ryousuke-san has already stated, I also find myself quite overcome with emotion for our wedding ceremony today.」

Misa
「As he has already stated, I also find myself quite overcome with emotion for our wedding ceremony today.」

Misa
「And also as previously stated, Marinpia Shionagi is a very special, very important place to me as well.」

Misa
「I am incredibly happy that Marinpia Shionagi has resumed operation, and that I am able to marry the man I love within its halls.」


Misa
「I am filled with joy to know that so many people are celebrating our marriage.」

Misa
「And to be surrounded by this many fish...!」
She stares dreamily at the tank behind her.
I can see the "saw that coming" written on the faces of our friends, as well as several others who know her.
Misa
「It's as if the fish are celebrating our marriage too... I feel I may have fallen in love even further with the ocean, and with nature.」

Misa
「I believe that I am able to live such a blessed life thanks to Ryousuke-san, as well as all of you, always being there by my side.」


Misa
「I believe that I am able to live such a blessed life thanks to my husband, as well as all of you, always being there by my side.」


Misa
「And so... I promise, as many times as need be! The two of us will continue to live a wonderful life together!」

Applause follows Misa's words of gratitude.
And suddenly, I hear surprised voices.
I feel like the lighting behind me goes dark.
Misa
「A whale shark!」
Misa sounds delighted.
A whale shark and several shoals of fish cut across the large tank behind us.
It's as if they're really celebrating our marriage.

Shuuichi
「If you could exchange a final kiss before our guests, then! This would be the perfect time!」

Natsuki
「All right, this is where I shine! I won't let this perfect moment slip by! You there, bride and groom, get closer!」


％Ｂ
「R-Right... You ready, Misa?」

Misa
「I am ready whenever. I am always ready for this.」

％Ｂ
「Then... here goes.」
Misa
「Yes...」
I gently pull Misa closer by the shoulders.
％Ｂ
「I love you, Misa.」
Misa
「And I, you... I love you, forever and always.」
