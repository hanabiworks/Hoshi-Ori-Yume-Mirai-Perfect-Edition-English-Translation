I head to the astronomy clubroom like always after classes.
I ended up getting hardly any sleep last night.
I reached a single conclusion after turning things over in my head all night long.
And that is―
"If I do confess, it isn't going to be until after the Tanabata Festival!"
I'll be able to do my job as an event committee member that way, and if she rejects me and things end up becoming awkward between us, then I won't have to see Ousaka that much after the festival anyway.

And once the Tanabata Festival's over, I'm gonna confess to Ousaka on the spot!
Just watch me!\n\r
So I'm keeping these feelings locked away in my heart until then!
That's the conclusion I arrived at.
...It may be a bit pessimistic, but this should be the best possible choice I have available to me at the moment.

％Ｂ
「Phew... All right.」
I knock on the door.
％Ｂ
「Ousaka. It's me.」
...No response.
％Ｂ
「Huh? Is she not here?」
％Ｂ
「Ousakaaa?」
I guess she isn't here yet.
％Ｂ
「I don't think she's ever been later than me.」
I probably shouldn't just go inside without permission, so I'll just wait in the hall.
I finally spot her coming down the hall after a decent amount of waiting.

％Ｂ
「Yo, you took a while today.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「Were you on cleaning duty or something?」
Sora
「...Someone wanted to talk to me.」
％Ｂ
「Talk to you? You have to go to the faculty office or something? Did you do something?」
Sora
「...*shake shake*」
Ousaka opens the door to the clubroom.
Sora
「...To the courtyard.」
％Ｂ
「The courtyard? Why?」
Sora
「...For a confession.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, I get it―
Wait, what!?」
Hold on a second!
％Ｂ
「A-A confession... Seriously!?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「Wha... You... Uh?」
all
Crap. Calm down.
There's no point in me freaking out like this...
But come on, right!?
What else am I supposed to do...? I only just decided last night that I wouldn't confess until the Tanabata Festival!

But she got a confession literally the next day...
Did I totally screw this up!?
％Ｂ
「O-Oh, really... Huh, really... A confession, huh... Huh, really...」
Sora
「...」
Ousaka grabs the telescope and starts heading toward the rooftop. I can't tell if she's noticed how this has affected me.

％Ｂ
「Oh... I'll hold it.」
all
I push away my agitation, snatch the telescope away from Ousaka, and head toward the roof.
％Ｂ
「...」
I'm doing everything I can do to stay calm as Ousaka and I set up the telescope.

％Ｂ
「...Hm? Whoa...!?」
Suddenly, she's right there in front of me, staring at my face.

％Ｂ
「Wh-What is it?」
Sora
「...You're a little weird today too. Different from always.」
％Ｂ
「A-Am I? That's―」
Totally true, isn't it...
Yeah, I might not be able to hide this.
％Ｂ
「...It's just... I've got some stuff on my mind.」
Sora
「...Sounds rough.」
It's your fault, you know!
...Not like I could say that, though.
all
Now that we've finished setting up the telescope, it's time to look through it... Or so I thought, but the sky that had been so clear's starting to get cloudier.

％Ｂ
「Aw... Right after we set it up, too.」
Sora
「...We'll wait a little.」
all
Ousaka places her back against the wall and sits down.
I stand a bit of an awkward distance away from her and sit down too.
％Ｂ
「...」
Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「...」
She's staring at me...
Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「...」
She's staring at me so much...
Sora
「...」
Ah... This is my fault for letting her see me get agitated, isn't it...?
Sora
「...」
Nope.
I just can't take this anymore.
％Ｂ
「...Mind if I ask you something?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「You know how... How you said someone confessed to you earlier?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「So... how'd that turn out?」
Sora
「...Turn out?」
She tilts her head a little and thinks.
％Ｂ
「I mean, um... like are you going to date them now... or something...?」
Sora
「...Nothing really changed.」
％Ｂ
「So you mean... you said no?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「Really... So you said no.」
all
I play it calm on the outside, but inside, I'm clenching my fist hard.
I wanna ask her who confessed to her too, but that would be crossing the line.\n\r

It'd be rude to the guy who got rejected too.
But I want to ask what I can while I have the chance.
For instance... Who her first love was─
％Ｂ
「Uh... You got anyone you like?」
Sora
「...Why do you ask?」
％Ｂ
「I just figured that was why you said no.」
Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「You're not... dating anyone, right?」
I ask hesitantly.
She's not gonna nod here, is she...?
Sora
「...No.」
％Ｂ
「O-Oh, really... So then do you have anyone you like...?」
Sora
「...I'm not planning on being in a special relationship with anyone right now.」
Her tone is the same as always.
But the words echo around in my head.
Because they mean that even if I do confess to Ousaka, the result would be the same as all the others.

％Ｂ
「Really...」
But still, I'm relieved to know that Ousaka isn't currently dating anyone, and that she didn't accept the confession today.

％Ｂ
「I guess the starry sky's pretty much your lover right now, eh?」
I say it jokingly, but it's a serious question to me.
Sora
「...*nod*」
She nods after a little thought.
Well, that's fine for now.
Because it means I still have a chance.
％Ｂ
「...Speaking of which, how'd you even get interested in the stars?」
I don't want her to think I'm weird for talking about confessions and stuff too much, so I change the subject.
Sora
「...Because the stars are very deep.」
That answer's pretty deep in and of itself.
How philosophical...
Sora
「...Mythology, history, science, fortune-telling... Learning about the stars exposes you to lots of different worlds.」

％Ｂ
「I get it. Yeah, I see what you mean by deep.」
The stories that Ousaka tells me are connected with mythology and history a lot of the time.

％Ｂ
「And you read books about that kinda stuff a lot too.」
Sora
「...It's fun learning about stars. Knowing about stars makes life more worthwhile.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, I like the sound of that.」
Sora
「...Is something I read in a book before.」
％Ｂ
「You sure love giving out secondhand knowledge...」
Same goes for her horoscopes...
Sora
「...And... the stars bring encounters too.」
％Ｂ
「Wha... Encounters?」
She stares right at my face.
％Ｂ
「Ousaka...?」
Sora
「...There was a boy who saved me once when I was still young.」

％Ｂ
「Huh? ...Saved you?」
Sora
「He encouraged me lots by talking to me about stars.」
Uh, I asked because I wanted to know what you needed saving from...\n\r

I guess that isn't the important part to her?
Sora
「...」
She looks right at me.
She stares intently.
Very intently...
％Ｂ
「...I-Is there something on my face?」
Sora
「...He was similar to you
, Ryou

.」
％Ｂ
「Similar to me? The boy who saved you, you mean?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「Hmm... But I don't really know that much about stars, and I don't remember doing anything like that either.」

Sora
「...」
I'm pretty sure I'd remember if I helped out a cute girl like Ousaka.\n\r

Though I don't know what the situation she needed saving from was...
Sora
「...I just thought you were similar. All I know is that if it weren't for him, I probably wouldn't be watching the stars like this now.」


Sora
「He taught me that the stars that I was only just watching until then could be fun to see. Having fun watching the stars makes things fun for everyone.」


Sora
「That's how I was able to meet lots of people... I made friends too... and most importantly...」
％Ｂ
「...」
Sora
「...I met you
, Ryou

.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah... We might not've been able to be together like this if you weren't into watching the stars.」

Sora
「...That's why the stars are very deep.」
That star that came falling down from the rooftop, on the day I came to this school before transferring in.
A tanzaku with "I wish I could see you again" written on it...
If it hadn't been for that, I wouldn't have met Ousaka─
％Ｂ
「...」
"I wish I could see you again"...?
Is that referring to the boy who saved her in the past?

So does that mean Ousaka's still thinking about her first love, like Segawa said?
And that person's someone who's really profoundly affected her life...
％Ｂ
「...This is gonna be tough.」
Sora
「...What is?」
％Ｂ
「...Nothing.」
all
My yet unknown rival in love is looking way more formidable than I imagined.
Am I really gonna be able to win out over him before the end of the Tanabata Festival...?
