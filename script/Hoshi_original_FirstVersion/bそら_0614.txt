The next day.
I head to the beach at the time Shinozaki told me. I see a bunch of familiar faces there already.

$$smh_OpenCHK
％Ｂ
「Good morning.」
Misa
「Good morning. Thank you very much for agreeing to help us today.」
Marika
「Good morning.」
Natsuki
「Morniiing. You're the last one here.」
all
Rikka
「Good morning.」
Sora
「...Morning.」
And Ousaka's here too.
all
Touko
「Hey, morning.」
％Ｂ
「...What? Yukimura? What are you doing here?」

Touko
「I was wandering around and then I got kidnapped.」
％Ｂ
「Excuse me? Kidnapped...?」
Natsuki
「Well you knooow, she was just walking around like she didn't have anything to do. It was a "Wanna come with if you're free?" kinda thing.」

％Ｂ
「So it was you again...」
Natsuki
「Touko came camping with us anyway, so we're all pals. Pals who ate curry from the same pot. No problem, right?」

％Ｂ
「I don't have any problem with it, but what about you, Yukimura?」
Touko
「Well, it's true I didn't have anything to do today. I guess it could be perfect for killing time.」

Rikka
「...I'm sure it won't just be for today. They'll probably make you come with them to everything until the very end once you're here even once.」


％Ｂ
「Pretty convincing coming from Narusawa...」
Touko
「What? Really? Oh man... This might've been a mistake.」
all
Misa
「Regardless, thank you all so very much for participating today. I'm very happy that even Touko-san and Sora-san are here!」


all
Sora
「...
Ryou 
He 
asked me to come.」
Natsuki
「Huh, and why would that be?」
％Ｂ
「Huh? Uhh... You know, I figured I could get Ousaka interested in participating in the festival by having her do something with all of us again.」

Natsuki
「Oh yeah, I see.」
Nice. That was pretty good for it being off the top of my head.
all
Misa
「Now then, let's all get to catching the fish. I will be counting on all of you.」
all
Catching fish ended up being harder than I thought.
They swim away just from you getting closer, and they move so fast it's like they disappear...

Touko
「Ahh, another one got away.」
％Ｂ
「So it's hard even with your reflexes, huh?」
Touko
「We might not be able to catch any at this rate.」
She's right. I still have zero too.
I bet the others must be having a hard time as well.
Natsuki
「Got oooone!」
％Ｂ
「Ohhh!? Segawa, you did it!?」
Touko
「Wha, really?」
Natsuki
「Look, look! See!? I got it perfectly!」
She excitedly shows us the display on her camera.
％Ｂ
「Wait, you meant you got a photo of one...」
all
Natsuki
「I only came to take photos. Misa-san says she wants to put up photos of the fish along with descriptions on the tanks.」


Natsuki
「I couldn't really get any good photos until now, but this one's great. Here, look, Misa-san!」

all
Misa
「Oh my! My, my...! How wonderful...! I have never seen one of these before myself...!」

Senpai's eyes start glittering with excitement when she sees the photo.
Misa
「This is a juvenile yellowtail wrasse! It's one of my favorite fish!」

％Ｂ
「Yellowtail wrasse?」
Misa
「It is a fish whose colors completely change between its juvenile and mature forms. The juvenile form is completely bright orange, with white spots with black outlines.」


Misa
「However, those white spots become smaller as it develops, and the orange becomes more blue toward its tail, and vivid blue dots appear.」


Misa
「And those blue dots are very beautiful! Like stars, floating in the night sky...」

Okihara-senpai looks entranced as she explains.
She must like that fish a lot...
Misa
「Thank you very much for the wonderful photo, Natsuki-san!」
％Ｂ
「Um... Why not actually capture it, instead of just taking a photo? Since it's here.」

Misa
「Oh... Yes, you're right. Natsuki-san, where was the yellowtail wrasse?」


Natsuki
「Uhh... I think it might still be somewhere over there.」
Misa
「I would love to collect it. Let us go!」
Natsuki
「Wawah, wait, Misa-san, you don't have to pull!」
Segawa gets dragged away by Okihara-senpai to go look for the yellowtail wrasse.
Touko
「That seems kinda fun. I'll go too.」
And Yukimura leaves with them.
Shinozaki and Narusawa seem to be struggling with trying to catch fish a bit of a ways away.
And─
all
％Ｂ
「Ousaka's... Oh, there she is.」
_00cutinBS
Ousaka's crouched down on some rocks, motionless.
％Ｂ
「The heck is she doing...?」
_00cutinBS
％Ｂ
「Hey, Ousaka. Something wrong?」
Sora
「...」
She turns around and quirks her finger at the shallow pool of water in front of her.

％Ｂ
「Something in there?」
Sora
「...A star.」
％Ｂ
「A star?」
all
I look inside. It's a bright red starfish.
％Ｂ
「Yeah, it's a star all right... Though it's more alive and weirdly colored than most...」

Sora
「...Should we grab it?」
％Ｂ
「Uhh... I have no idea. It's definitely an ocean animal, so I guess we might as well.」

all
I reach out to the starfish to grab it.
％Ｂ
「Oh... This thing's stuck on pretty tight.」
The starfish won't come away from the rock.
Sora
「...What's it feel like?」
％Ｂ
「Hmm... Feels pretty rough. Harder than you'd expect. Wanna try touching?」
Sora
「...*shake shake*」
Ousaka's usually all for anything that's even slightly related to stars, but I guess this is an exception.

％Ｂ
「Still though, I can't really get it off...」
I might injure it if I pull too hard.

Sora
「...You don't have to.」
％Ｂ
「Don't worry, I can just peel it away from the edge and... Ow!?」
Sora
「...
Ryou
Hgh
!?」
％Ｂ
「I cut myself on the rock... Oh, but I got the starfish off.」
I was able to collect the starfish, but only after a bit of pain.

all
％Ｂ
「Finally got my first catch.」
Ousaka and I collected a starfish together.
I can't help but smile at her. Stars are really a theme here.
─But Ousaka's staring hard at my hand.
Sora
「...
Ryou, you're 
You're 
bleeding...」
％Ｂ
「Hm?」
She's right. There's a bit of blood seeping out from my right index finger.
％Ｂ
「Oh... This is nothing. Just lick it and it'll be fine.」
Sora
「...I see...」
She steps beside me, grabs my right hand, and proceeds to lick my index finger.

％Ｂ
「Wha... H-Hey...!?」
Sora
「...Hamh.」
She puts my finger directly inside her mouth as I'm stumbling over my words.
％Ｂ
「O-Ousaka...!?」
Sora
「Mh... chu... mlh...」
She's licking my finger inside her mouth.
I'm shocked, but this is also a bit erotic...
Sora
「Nh... Salty.」
She pulls away. My finger's been licked clean of blood.

％Ｂ
「Why'd you do that...?」
Sora
「...?」
Sora
「...Because you said, "Lick it and it'll be fine."」



％Ｂ
「Oh... Ohh...」
I definitely did say that. But I never asked her to do it for me...
Sora
「...Is it fine now?」
Crap... My heart's beating so fast...
％Ｂ
「Y-Yeah... Probably... Thanks...」
Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「Uhh... Oh, we'll need a bucket for the starfish. I'll go get one real quick.」

Sora
「...*nod*」
I walk away from Ousaka, toward where our stuff is.
％Ｂ
「Oh man... That was a surprise...」
I never thought Ousaka would do something like that...
I stare dimly at my right index finger.
Looks like the blood's stopped.
Ousaka's peering into the water by the rocks, looking for more animals.
I exhale as I watch her.
...Not good... My heart's not calming down...
all
Misa
「Thank you all very much. I could not have obtained all these without your help.」

We were talking about how we might not be able to catch anything at first, but we ended up filling the cooler box we brought with various marine animals by the end.


Misa
「Now if only we had a yellowtail wrasse...」
Seems like she failed to capture the yellowtail wrasse.
Sora
「...Yellowtail wrasse?」
all
％Ｂ
「It's apparently a fish Okihara-senpai really likes. She says its body looks like the night sky.」

Sora
「...I want to see that.」
Her eyes glitter.
all
％Ｂ
「I'm pretty sure Segawa got a photo... Wait, Ousaka?」
She's already walking toward Segawa.
She's so honest about what she wants.
Sora
「...Natsu. Show me the photo. The yellow teal red.」
Natsuki
「Yellow teal red? You mean the yellowtail wrasse?」
Sora
「...*nod* That.」
Natsuki
「Juuust a second. I took a lot of photos, so it's going to take me some time to find that one...」
Mhm... Things are looking good.
I'm sure that Ousaka'll wanna participate in the Tanabata Festival once she understands how fun it is to do things with others.

I'm definitely glad I brought her with us today.
all
Misa
「Anyway, this should be more than enough for today. Let's take them all back to school, and go home.」

％Ｂ
「...I'm the one who's going to have to do that, right?」
Rikka
「It's the reason you're here, isn't it?」
％Ｂ
「...Yeah, it is.」
But that box looks a lot heavier than I was expecting...
Misa
「I have prepared a cart, so please use this.」
all
I stack the two cooler boxes on top of each other on the cart.

The boxes are filled with seawater in addition to the animals we caught.\n\r

This looks pretty heavy...
％Ｂ
「Well... It's not like I'm gonna be putting them on my back or anything, so I think I can manage.」

Touko
「Do your best as a man.」

Natsuki
「Show us your cool side.」
Yeah, it's not like I could make the girls do heavy lifting either.
all
I grab the handles of the cart and try pulling.
％Ｂ
「Nh... gnhhh...!?」
It-It's so heavy! It's even heavier than I thought! It's not moving!
Marika
「A-Are you okay? Want me to push from behind?」
％Ｂ
「N-No, it's fine. You'll just hurt your back if you do that 'cause of the cart's height.」

Marika
「But...」
Misa
「Um, please do not overexert yourself.」
％Ｂ
「Th-This is fine... It's what I came here for.」
all
I can at least pull it along. But I have to use all of my strength to do so!

％Ｂ
「Urghhh... Khah...!」
I'll just have to get as far as I can and―
Wait...
％Ｂ
「Hm...?」
...It got a little lighter?
I turn around to see Ousaka behind the cart.
She's pushing it from behind.
％Ｂ
「Hey, you don't have to. You're gonna hurt your back like that.」
Sora
「...No issues.」
Touko
「Ohhh. It's the perfect height for Fluffyhead.」
Natsuki
「It's like the cart was made for Sora.」
The cart's low enough that it'd be awkward for the others to push, but it's apparently just the right height for Ousaka.

％Ｂ
「...You sure?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「Okay... Thanks, then.」
Sora
「...Mh.」
She sticks her thumb up at me.
We carried the boxes to a chemistry classroom in the old school building.\n \n\r
The room's already been outfitted with water tanks, and we transferred the fish and other animals into them under Okihara-senpai's supervision.

％Ｂ
「Phew... Looking pretty good.」
There still aren't that many animals, but it still looks like a pretty proper aquarium when they're all lined up like this.

％Ｂ
「When'd you bring these tanks in?」
Marika
「Yesterday. We carried them in together with Narusawa-san and the others. This was the only place that was big enough for us to be able to make an aquarium in.」


Misa
「Yes, the second chemistry classroom was just slightly too cramped.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, that's true. But I'm surprised you were able to get permission.」
Marika
「I think Nirasawa-kun negotiated it.」
％Ｂ
「Man, he's real useful...」
all
Touko
「Aw, man... There goes my favorite relaxation spot...」
It appears the old school building's owner hadn't been notified of this.

％Ｂ
「...It's a shame. But it'll only be until the Tanabata Festival.」

I whisper to Yukimura.
Touko
「Sigh... Well, it's not like I can do anything about it. But I think I could like the soothing effect of being surrounded by fish tanks too.」


％Ｂ
「You're pretty positive...」
all
Ousaka's standing a bit apart from the others, staring intently at the fish swimming around in the tanks.\n\r

Okihara-senpai calls out to her.

Misa
「What do you think, Sora-san?」
Sora
「...Pretty.」
Misa
「Ufufu, thank you very much. I'm very grateful that you and everyone else came to help today.」

Misa
「I find I am very glad to have decided to participate in the Tanabata Festival. It's very fun to create something together with all of you.」


Sora
「...」
Misa
「It makes me look back and think that perhaps I should have relied more on many more people in the past. It makes me a little sad to think that this will be my last Tanabata Festival.」


Misa
「I do not wish for you to feel the same way I do, Sora-san. So what do you think? Wouldn't you also like to participate in the Tanabata Festival?」


Sora
「...」
Misa
「I will also help as much as I am able. Your thoughts?」

Sora
「...」
Misa
「You still do not wish to participate?」
Sora
「...I don't know yet.」
Misa
「I see... There is nothing to be done about that, then. But if you find yourself interested, please tell us at any time.」

Sora
「...*nod*...」
