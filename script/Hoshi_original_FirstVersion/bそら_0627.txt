The next day.
I take Ousaka to the event committee office as soon as classes end.

％Ｂ
「Hey everyone!」
I tell them about how the astronomy club's decided to participate in the Tanabata Festival.
There wasn't a formal meeting planned for today, so I ended up just telling Shuuichi and whoever happened to be there.

Which included Shinozaki and the other members who were supporting the naturalist club, so they were all there to welcome Ousaka.

all
Shuuichi
「So now every club's participating. You've done some good work.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah... I'm glad we made it just in time for the meeting next week.」
all
Marika
「I'm looking forward to working with you, Ousaka-san.」
Misa
「Let's both do our best together, Sora-san.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
all
Shuuichi
「So do you know what you're doing for the festival?」
％Ｂ
「...We're gonna figure it out starting now.」
Shuuichi
「Okay. But it's a good thing that she's decided to participate. There's still a lot that needs doing, so I'll be counting on you.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah... I know. First thing's gonna be figuring out what we're going to do, as soon as possible.」

all
Natsuki
「Do you have any ideas, Sora?」
Sora
「...*shake shake*」
Rikka
「So you more or less just decided to participate in general for now.」
Touko
「Sounds like Fluffyhead.」
all
％Ｂ
「About that. I want all of your opinions about what the astronomy club should do too.」

％Ｂ
「It's partly 'cause we don't have much time, but I've talked with Ousaka, and we wanna make something that needs everyone's help instead of something simple we could do alone.」


Misa
「That does sound like a good idea. The naturalist club's aquarium would also have been impossible by myself, but I can enjoy myself preparing it now, thanks to all of your support.」


Natsuki
「So what you're saying is you're going out of your way to do something hard. Sounds like it's gonna be interesting!」

all
Shuuichi
「Hold on, are you sure? You better not try something so hard that you don't end up making it in time for the Tanabata Festival.」


％Ｂ
「That's why we want your opinions and help. We'll be able to narrow down our options if we have an idea beforehand of how many people we'll have helping us, right?」


Shuuichi
「The event committee won't be able to help you, you know. If anything, I'd want you to go help the other clubs too.」

Misa
「We will help you, then.」
all
％Ｂ
「Huh?」
Misa
「The naturalist club's aquarium is already nearing completion, thanks to Marika-san and the others. And of course, I have not forgotten that you and Sora-san have helped us as well

, Ryousuke-san

.」

Misa
「It is now our turn to help you two. We may not be able to lend a hand every day, but I intend on helping the astronomy club as much as I am able.」


％Ｂ
「Senpai...」
Marika
「It's like Okihara-san said. We've already gotten pretty far with the aquarium. So we'll join the support team for the astronomy club too～」


Sora
「...Mari.」
all
Natsuki
「We'll be joining too, of course. Right, Rikka, Touko?」

Rikka
「Wha... Me too?」
Touko
「Um... I thought I was only going to be helping the naturalist club.」
Natsuki
「Stop being so cold! It's not like they're total strangers. We all ate curry from the same pot as Sora!」


Touko
「There it is, Camera-chan's favorite argument. Mmm... Well, I'm fine with it. Not like I have anything better to do.」

Rikka
「Sigh... I'm already doing this anyway. Fine, I'll stick with it until the end.」

％Ｂ
「Segawa, Narusawa, Yukimura... Thanks, guys.」
all
Shuuichi
「You added five people in one go. So that makes seven of you total. All right, you'll probably be able to pull off most things with this many people.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, I'm really grateful.」
Shuuichi
「I'm gonna go tell the student council and faculty that the astronomy club's formally decided to participate. You all can use this room to talk about what you're going to do if you want.」


％Ｂ
「Thanks. Appreciate it.」
all
Shuuichi leaves the committee office, and I turn toward everyone who's agreed to help us.

％Ｂ
「All right. I wanna start by getting some ideas right off the bat. Anyone have any suggestions? Anything's fine.」

Natsuki
「I do! A star photo gallery! We could put photos of stars up on display and show them to guests with descriptions.」

％Ｂ
「I see. Yeah, sounds like something an astronomy club would do.」
all
Marika
「I have one! What about a stargazing tour? I don't have any specific ideas since I just thought of it, though.」

％Ｂ
「Hmhm. That's something you could only get from the astronomy club.」
Misa
「Perhaps we could shine blacklights onto jellyfish and create a mock interstellar flight simulation? I can offer our jellyfish for it.」


％Ｂ
「That sounds like it'd certainly have an air of mystery to it.」
all
Rikka
「What about a star-themed concert? There are actually lots of pieces that use the stars or space as a motif.」

％Ｂ
「A concert... A collaboration with the concert band might be interesting...」
all
Touko
「You know how they have those glow-in-the-dark stickers? Luminescent, I think? What if we stick those on the walls and ceiling in a dark room and let them light up?」

％Ｂ
「What are people gonna do in there?」
Touko
「It's a rest area.」
...Sounds like Yukimura.
％Ｂ
「For my suggestion... Well, it's the astronomy club, so I think something where people can actually try using the astronomical telescope might be cool.」

all
％Ｂ
「What about you, Ousaka? Anything really jump out at you so far?」
Sora
「...」
She frowns and tilts her head.
％Ｂ
「Then is there anything that you wanna try doing specifically?」

Sora
「...People write their wishes on tanzaku and tie them to bamboo.」
％Ｂ
「...I guess that's kinda related to stars, in a way... but I don't really know if we'd be doing much for them like that...」

Sora
「...And 
Ryou makes 
you make 
all of those wishes come true.」
％Ｂ
「That's a bit too much for me...」
all
...We all had lots of other ideas after that too, but we wrapped up our impromptu meeting after none of them really seemed to resonate with Ousaka.

％Ｂ
「Anyway, I'll put the ideas we had today into a list or something. Thanks for today, everyone.」

Everyone starts packing up after we're done talking.
Sora
「...Oh...」
Ousaka's acting a little off.
％Ｂ
「Hm? What's wrong?」
Sora
「...I need to...」
She needs to...?
Sora
「...Nothing.」
That's when I get it.
％Ｂ
「I think it's always great to say thank you in times like these.」

I pat her on the head.
Sora
「...*nod*」
all
Sora
「U...Um, everyone.」
They all turn around at Ousaka's voice.
She stumbles over her words for a moment when everyone looks at her, but she takes a small, but deep breath.

Sora
「...Thank you... all... very much.」
She bows her head low.
Everyone smiles and speaks in unison.
all
Marika & Natsuki & Misa & Rikka & Touko
「You're welcome!」
all
Ousaka said she wanted to stargaze again today after the meeting, so the two of us turn in the request form to stay late and carry the telescope up to the roof.


She sets up the telescope so it's pointing toward the south.
Sora
「...Mm...」
She quirks her finger at the eyepiece.
％Ｂ
「What can you see?」
Sora
「...It might make you emotional.」
I look in.
all
％Ｂ
「Whoooooaaahhh!? Rings! I see rings! This is Saturn!」

Ousaka was right. I'm a little emotional at the sight.
％Ｂ
「Amazing! This is amazing! I've never seen Saturn before!」

I'm getting really excited!
Ousaka adjusts the bearing of the telescope again.
Sora
「...Mm...」
％Ｂ
「What is it this time?」
％Ｂ
「...It's red... What's this?」
Sora
「...Mars.」
％Ｂ
「Ohh... Earth's next-door neighbor.」
She adjusts the bearing again.
％Ｂ
「Huh... Is this Mars again? No... It's red, but it's different...」

Sora
「...Antares.」
％Ｂ
「Antares, huh? Antares is in Scorpio, right? I remember that.」

Sora
「...Want to hear about Scorpio's origin?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah... No, wait a second. Scorpio, right?」
I desperately wring the little I know about constellations out from my brain.
％Ｂ
「Uhh, I'm pretty sure Scorpio was the scorpion that killed Orion.」
％Ｂ
「And that's why Orion runs away below the western skies when Scorpio rises in the eastern skies... Am I right?」

Sora
「...You are.」
％Ｂ
「Hah, looks like I at least know that much.」
Sora
「...Antares is the brightest star in Scorpio. Do you know why that red star is called Antares, then?」


％Ｂ
「Gh... No, I don't know that...」
Sora
「...Antares is a red star, like Mars. Mars in Greek is "Ares." They added "Anti," which means to oppose, to make "Anti-Ares"... and so, Antares.」


％Ｂ
「Huh, so it went from Anti-Ares to Antares.」
Sora
「...Antares is much bigger than Mars.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, I saw a video comparing the sizes of stars the other day. Have you seen it?」

Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「I figured. Antares is pretty big, right? Though I don't remember if Mars was in it.」

Sora
「...The Sun is 200 times the size of Mars. Antares is 720 times the size of the sun. Which means Antares is 144,000 times bigger than Mars.」








％Ｂ
「Man, Mars doesn't even have a chance...」
...Still, though. Ousaka sure gets talkative when it comes to astronomy.
And she always looks like she's having fun.
Getting to see Ousaka like this right before my eyes is really precious to me.

all
％Ｂ
「Mmm...」
My neck's starting to ache again after looking up at the sky for so long.
One of the nice things about the telescope is that this doesn't happen...
Sora
「...Neck tired?」
％Ｂ
「Hm? Yeah...」
all
Ousaka sees me stretching out my neck, thinks a little, then kneels on the ground and pats her lap.

Sora
「...Mm...」
％Ｂ
「Well, that's...」
Sora
「...?...」
％Ｂ
「...You sure?」
I'm still waiting for Ousaka's response to my confession.
She was giving me a lap pillow when it happened too.
I feel like her giving me one now would just make us think about that again. I can't help but hesitate.

Sora
「...I'm fine with it. But I won't if you don't want to.


」
％Ｂ
「...No way... Of course I want to.」
Sora
「...Then... Mm.」
And so I end up having her giving me that lap pillow.
％Ｂ
「...Thanks.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
Ousaka looks up at the stars with my head on her lap.
I look up at the sky, and at Ousaka.
Ousaka's face is right there, within reach.
I touched that pale cheek just about a week ago...
...I want to touch it again.
But let's not do that now.
The next time I touch Ousaka will be once we're in a proper relationship.
Sora
「...」
Ousaka suddenly looks down at me.
％Ｂ
「Wh-What is it...?」
Sora
「...Do you know how many constellations there are?」
％Ｂ
「Wha... How many constellations there are? Is there a specific number?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
Guess that should've been obvious.
％Ｂ
「I've never even thought about it... Thirty... No, maybe more. Like fifty?」

Sora
「...Eighty-eight.」
I was actually kinda close.
Sora
「...There used to be lots more. But the International Astronomical Union decided on eighty-eight in 1928, because there were just too many to keep track of.」




％Ｂ
「Yeah, I could see there being too many. I bet people started making new ones up and stuff. I remember I used to randomly join stars in the sky together to make constellations.」


Sora
「...People used to do the same thing in the past. They drew pictures in the sky. It's just that some of them are still here today.」

％Ｂ
「Pictures in the sky, huh? Yeah, it's a huge canvas, isn't it? If everything were decided later, then we probably could've had stuff like an airplane constellation and a missile constellation.」


Sora
「...Airplane constellation...」
％Ｂ
「Oh, well, those are just constellations I made up back when I was a kid. Don't worry, I know those don't actually exist.」

Sora
「Airplane constellation... Missile constellation...」
％Ｂ
「Yeah... Andー」
Sora
「...Monster constellation...」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, I thought of one like that too. I'm surprised you guessed that one. Let's see... Which ones did I connect for those again?」

I start to point the stars out, but Ousaka points at the sky before I can.

Sora
「...That one and that one... and that one, and you get the airplane constellation.」
％Ｂ
「Right, I think the one I thought of was like that too.」
Sora
「...The missile constellation is a rectangle with that first-magnitude star in the center.」

Sora
「The monster constellation is very big. Big enough to take up half the night sky.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, exactly. It doesn't have an actual shape, but you just make the biggest shape you can with stars and that's how you get the... 

Wait a second, how do you know all of those?」
Sora
「...You taught them to me
, Ryou

.」
％Ｂ
「I did...? When?」
Sora
「...」
Sora
「...Once, when I was young, I got lost at the Tanabata Festival.」
％Ｂ
「You got lost...?」
Sora
「...I was lonely, and scared... I couldn't even cry. I was just standing there by myself, with lots of people passing me by.」

Sora
「...That's when a boy pulled me by the hand.」
％Ｂ
「...Lost... at the Tanabata Festival...」
I can feel those words catch on something in my brain.
I feel like I can suddenly feel warmth in the palm of my hand.
...Back when I used to live in Shionagi, I usually went to go to the park after playing at the city's Tanabata Festival, to watch the stars.

The park didn't have as many lights back then as it does now. I remember you could see the stars really clearly.

And in my memories, there's another person sitting next to me.
I thought that was Shinozaki, because they were childhood memories.
But... now that I think about it, Shinozaki was ill back then. She couldn't really leave the house.

So that person couldn't have been her.
So then... the person I was in the park with that night after the Tanabata Festival, that I pointed out the airplane and missile constellations to was─

She wasn't crying. She wasn't looking around for anyone...\n \n\r

She was just looking up at the night sky.
She looked so sad, all alone, with a crowd of adults walking by around her─
It seemed to me like she was looking up at the sky to keep her tears from falling from her eyes.\n\r

That's why I called out to her.
％Ｂ
『You lost?』
Girl
『...』
I asked her again, and she widened her eyes at me in surprise, and then fixed her gaze on me. 

Her eyes gradually began to dampen.
She might've fully realized her situation after I asked her if she was lost.

She started crying─or at least I thought she was going to, but then she pulled her lips tight and stifled her tears.

Girl
『...No.』
％Ｂ
『Oh, okay. So you came here alone, like me?』


Girl
『...*nod*』
％Ｂ
『Then we should walk around together.』
Girl
『...My parents told me not to go anywhere with people I don't know.』
％Ｂ
『I'll buy you a candy strawberry.』
Girl
『...I'll come with.』
I took the girl's hand and we walked around the Tanabata Festival together.
Because I couldn't just ignore her when she looked so lonely...
We bought candy strawberries at a stall like I promised, and we walked around the festival together while eating them.

We watched some big tanzaku flutter in the wind, looked at the prizes they had for a lottery, bought a single shaved ice and shared it...

We enjoyed the festival as kids, holding hands the whole time.
And once we got tired of the crowds, we went to the park.
％Ｂ
『Why were you looking up at the sky back there?』
Girl
『...I was watching the stars.』
％Ｂ
『The stars? Why?』
Girl
『...Because the stars have always been a guide for not getting lost.』
％Ｂ
『Huh...? Wait, so then you really were lost?』
Girl
『...*shake shake*』
％Ｂ
『You're pretty stubborn...』
The girl looked back up at the sky.
％Ｂ
『...Is it really that fun watching the stars that much?』
Girl
『...I'm not watching stars. I'm watching lots of different stories.』
％Ｂ
『Stories?』
Girl
『...Stars become constellations when you connect them. Each and every constellation has a story.』

％Ｂ
『I know constellations too! Check it out! Uhh, uhh... There's that star and that star! Connect those like this, and you get the airplane constellation!』


Girl
『...That isn't a constellation.』
％Ｂ
『Then you connect that one, that one, and that one! The missile constellation!』
Girl
『...That's not one either.』
％Ｂ
『Gnh... Then, uh...』
Girl
『...Can you see that big, bright star there?』
％Ｂ
『Huh? Which one? Oh, that shiny one?』
Girl
『...That's Vega. The brightest star in Lyra. It's Tanabata's Princess Orihime.』
％Ｂ
『L-Lyra? H-Huh, really... So that one's Princess Orihime. So which one's Hikoboshi?』

Girl
『There's another bright star below Vega.』
％Ｂ
『Found it! There's a big one!』
Girl
『...That's Altair. The brightest star in Aquila. Tanabata's Hikoboshi.』
％Ｂ
『A-Aquila? A-Al...Allailer...?』
Girl
『...Altair. And to the left of Vega and Altair is Deneb, in Cygnus.』

％Ｂ
『The Singer in Denim!』
Girl
『...Deneb, in Cygnus. Connecting those three stars makes the Summer Triangle.』
％Ｂ
『Huh... The Summer Triangle... That's a nice name for a constellation.』
Girl
『...The Summer Triangle isn't a constellation...』
％Ｂ
『Really? Stars are kind of a pain. But you know lots about them. You're awesome!』

Girl
『...No, I'm not.』
％Ｂ
『No, you are! You know lots that I don't know! It's fun hearing you talk!』

Girl
『...No one's ever... said that before...』
％Ｂ
『Tell me more stories about stars!』
Girl
『...Do you know Polaris?』
％Ｂ
『Polar-is? I know about polar bears!』
Girl
『...No. Polaris. It's the North Star that's the marker so you don't get lost. If you extend from the Big Dipper in Ursa Major―』

％Ｂ
『Hm? What's wrong?』
Girl
『...I just remembered. If I move toward Deneb, I'll reach my house.』
％Ｂ
『Toward denim?』
Girl
『...Deneb. Cygnus. I'm supposed to move in that direction when I'm lost.』

％Ｂ
『See? You were lost after all.』
Girl
『...*shake shake*』
％Ｂ
『...Okay, fine. I'll walk you to your house, then.』

Girl
『...Are you sure?』
％Ｂ
『My dad said it's dangerous for girls to walk alone at night. I don't really get it, but it's dangerous. I'm a man, so I have to protect women!』


Girl
『...Thank you.』
％Ｂ
『All right, let's walk toward Denim! Gooo!』
Girl
『...Deneb.』
We left the park and started walking toward our "marker."
She knew a lot about stars, but she had forgotten one crucial thing.

That's right... The stars move.
Their positions change depending on the season and the time of day.
And so, of course, we got lost after following Deneb.

Girl
『...Where are we?』
Girl
『...Sniff... Hgh... Oh no... I don't know how to get home...』
％Ｂ
『It'll be okay! I'm with you!』
Girl
『...But... I'm scared... What if I can't get home...?』
％Ｂ
『Your hand!』
Girl
『...My hand...?』
％Ｂ
『I'll hold your hand. Then you won't be scared anymore. I'll always be right next to you, no matter where you go.』

Girl
『...*nod*...』
％Ｂ
『And look, the constellations are still with us too. The airplane constellation's right there! It's cool, isn't it?』

％Ｂ
『If any bad guys show up, then the missile constellation right there'll defeat them! Nyooom, kabooom! See?』

％Ｂ
『And there's the final weapon, the monster constellation! It's stronger and cooler than any other constellation!』

Girl
『...Monsters are scary.』
％Ｂ
『Th-They're scary for me too! But it's okay! You won't be scared if we're holding hands!』

Girl
『...』
％Ｂ
『Let's head to the marketplace first. There's policemen there, and your mom and dad might be there too.』


Girl
『...*nod*』
％Ｂ
『I'll stay with you until you get home.』
Girl
『...*nod*』
％Ｂ
「Yeah... Yeah, that did happen. But... that was... you...?」

Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「No way...」
After we went back to the marketplace and walked to a police station, we met her parents who were searching for her at a lost child center.

The girl cried and hugged her mom... and I left for home after making sure she was going to be okay.

Sora
「...I couldn't thank you because you disappeared suddenly.」
％Ｂ
「You found your parents, so I just thought you wouldn't want me to see you crying. Since you seemed pretty stubborn.」

Sora
「...I wasn't crying.」
％Ｂ
「See?」
Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「But still... so I had met you a long time ago already...」
Sora
「...*nod*」
Ousaka smiles a little as she looks at me.
Sora
「...I always remember the airplane and missile constellations when I look up at the sky.」

Sora
「...You showed me back then that the stars were fun.」

％Ｂ
「I don't think I did that much, though.」
Sora
「...*shake shake*... I started liking stars even more thanks to you.」

％Ｂ
「So I'm the one who got you so into the stars?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「But when'd you realize I was him?」
Sora
「...Pretty much right after we met.」
％Ｂ
「O-Oh, really... I had completely forgotten until just now. Sorry.」

Sora
「...*shake shake*... The stars bring encounters too...」

She gently places both hands on my cheeks.
％Ｂ
「Ousaka...?」
Sora
「...I've been thinking all this time.」
％Ｂ
「Hm...?」
Sora
「...I like you
, Ryou

...」
％Ｂ
「Wha...」
Her unexpected words catch me by surprise.
It takes me a few moments to understand what she just said.
Sora
「...But I didn't know if those feelings were right... I thought I might like you... just because you were the boy who saved me when I was young...」


Sora
「I thought that would be rude to the present you... That's why I was thinking... about why I like you.


」




％Ｂ
「...」
Sora
「...The 
Ryou 
you 
right before my eyes is looking right at me. He's kind... and he watches over me from really close...」

Sora
「...He extends his hand to me... He pushes me from behind... He walks beside me.」


Sora
「...Thinking about you
, Ryou

... makes my heart warm.」
Sora
「...That's why... there are no issues... I know without a doubt that I like you

, Ryou

.」
She smiles at me.
She looks so happy. As if she were feeling refreshed after communicating all of her feelings.

％Ｂ
「Tha...Thanks...」
I wanted to respond with something nice, but I couldn't really say anything other than a totally normal thank you.

％Ｂ
「I'm crazy happy... or actually, this is pretty emotional...」
I feel like I might start crying.
Ousaka's accepted my confession...
Or more like, Ousaka's the one who confessed to me.
She said... she likes me...
％Ｂ
「Hey... Can I say it again?」
Sora
「...?」
％Ｂ
「Ousaka... No... Sora. I like you.」

Sora
「...*nod*...」
％Ｂ
「I wanna go out with you. I want to be your boyfriend, and keep watching the stars together with you from now on.」

Sora
「...」
Sora just stares intently at my face.
Then she smiles just a bit and─
％Ｂ
「...Hnh...!?」
Sora
「...Mmh... chu...」
She kisses me gently in place of a reply.
Sora
「...Nh...mh...」
It's an indescribably gentle kiss, filled with countless feelings and thoughts.
It communicates Sora's feelings far more clearly than words ever could.
Sora
「...Chu... mh...～～～ ...nh...」
I want to make a request to Zeus, if possible.
For him to place the two of us, during this moment, into the heavens as a constellation. Just like how he etched so many other tales into the stars.

To preserve this moment, of Sora and me kissing...
