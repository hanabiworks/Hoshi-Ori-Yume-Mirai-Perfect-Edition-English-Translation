％Ｂ
「C-Coming!」
Misa
「Good morning.」
％Ｂ
「G-Good morning!」
Okihara-senpai's come over to my place, holding a bag that most likely has studying supplies in it.\n\r

It's currently... ten minutes before nine o'clock.
％Ｂ
「Um... Thank you very much for coming... for someone like me.」

Misa
「Oh no, it's fine. I came because I wanted to.」

％Ｂ
「Uh...」
She came because she wanted to?
D-Does that mean...!?
Misa
「You've done so much for me, Ryousuke-san. I wanted to do everything I can to thank you.」

Misa
「You've done so much for me. I wanted to do everything I can to thank you.」

％Ｂ
「I-I see. As thanks.」
O-Oh...
So she just wanted to thank me.
...That's a little disappointing.
But that doesn't change the fact that she came all the way here, and I'm really grateful for that.

％Ｂ
「Then please, come on in.」
Misa
「Yes, please excuse me.」
Misa
「I haven't been in this room since I came with Marika-san to make the fish stickers. It seems somewhat nostalgic.」

％Ｂ
「Though it hasn't been that long since then.」
Misa
「Hehe... Perhaps it's because a lot has happened since?」
Misa
「Still, your room is always so tidy.」
％Ｂ
「Well, it is a new house.」
Misa
「There's that too, but it's organized very scrupulously. It feels very nice to be in here.」

％Ｂ
「It's just the way rooms should be. Hahaha.」
...Not gonna tell her that I immediately cleaned up my room after getting off the phone last night.

％Ｂ
「Anyway, I'll go get us some drinks. What would you like?」

Misa
「Oh no, there's no need. I've brought some.」
％Ｂ
「You've brought some?」
all
She pulls a canteen out from her bag.
Actually, two of them.
Misa
「I made two people's worth, so we could spend as much time as possible studying.」

％Ｂ
「Th-Thank you very much...」
Misa
「Now then, let's begin!」
％Ｂ
「Huh? Already?」
Misa
「There isn't much time until finals. We will be studying all day from morning until night. Now then, what should we start with?」


...Looks like she's in Okihara-sensei mode.
I'm starting to feel like an idiot for expecting anything else.
all
Though I'm still happy that it's just the two of us...
Misa
「...And in this case, you fit the variables into the equation from earlier and solve it.」

Misa
「That way, you can find the angle here. Which will naturally lead to knowing what angle A is as well.」

％Ｂ
「Ohh... I see.」
Misa
「The thing to remember here is to use this formula in this situation.」
Studying together with her is stimulating in two different ways.
One, she's genuinely good at teaching.
She's really good at explaining the essential points.
She's been neatly explaining how one thing leads to another to me.
I find that I've gotten a deeper understanding of the material, which only further improves my studying.
I've never been able to solve problems this easily before.
And there's one more stimulating thing.
That would be...
％Ｂ
「Um... So can I solve this problem in the same way as the one from earlier?」
Misa
「Let's see... May I take a look?」
She leans over.
And when she does that... I can feel her abundant breasts.
Squish!
％Ｂ
「...!」
Misa
「Is something the matter?」
％Ｂ
「Oh, no...」
Is it that she can't tell? Or is she doing it on purpose...?
No, there's no way Okihara-senpai of all people would be doing this on purpose.\n\r
She must just not really pay that much attention to those kinds of things.
Still... This is a bit rough.
I'm gonna lose my focus if this continues.
No! Focus, focus...!
Misa
「I see, I see. In this case, you should do as before and...」
Squish squish...
％Ｂ
「...!」
Misa
「Um... Are you listening?」
％Ｂ
「Huh? Oh, yes! I'm listening!」
Misa
「Are you really?」
She peers at my face.
Squiiish.
％Ｂ
「...!」
Her boobs press onto me even more, enough to deform them.
％Ｂ
「I-I'm sorry... I was zoning out a bit. I need to clear my mind of temptation...」

Misa
「I understand that you want to play, but you need to focus properly, okay?」

％Ｂ
「I'm sorry...」
Okihara-senpai in teacher mode immediately notices when I'm not concentrating.

...I couldn't possibly tell her that I can't focus because I can feel her breasts against me.

Misa
「Let's start working on these problems now. They should be easy to solve, as long as you understand the concepts from earlier.」

％Ｂ
「I...I understand.」
I just need to study.
I need to bear it for now. Yeah.
...What exactly am I bearing?
I glance at Okihara-senpai as I start on the worksheet.
Misa
「...」
She said she needs to study too, so she's had a textbook open this whole time.

Misa
「...」
But she's not writing notes or solving problems or anything. She's just reading the textbook.

Misa
「...」
Just reading that textbook...
％Ｂ
「U-Um... May I ask you something?」
Misa
「What? Oh, is there something you don't understand?」
She leans over and looks at my notebook.
Plomf.
％Ｂ
「...!」
Focus...!
Misa
「You've got it! Wonderful!」

％Ｂ
「Ahem... Th-That's great. Anyway, I was actually wondering about you...」

Misa
「About... me?」
％Ｂ
「Because you've just been reading a textbook this whole time...」
Misa
「Yes, I also have to study for exams, and so I was thinking of making use of the waiting time while you work on these problems.」



％Ｂ
「But you don't do any worksheets or anything?」
Misa
「No, I've always studied this way, ever since I was a child.」
％Ｂ
「All you do is read textbooks?」
Misa
「Yes. Exam questions are always based on the textbook material. So as long as I memorize the entire textbook, there are no questions I cannot answer.」


％Ｂ
「...Are you serious?」
Misa
「I am... Um... Is there something strange about that?」
...Those are the words of a genius.
An ordinary person like me could never say anything like that.
But she's still this good at teaching, so that means that she must actually be able to understand all this just by reading the textbook...

％Ｂ
「By the way, what are your exam results usually like?」

Misa
「Do you mean as in placements and such?」
％Ｂ
「Yes.」
Misa
「Let's see... I believe I'm usually third or fourth?」
％Ｂ
「Thir...」
Third or fourth!?
She means her placement in her year, right!?
So that means... she's in the top five every single time!?
Misa
「I'm not very good at humanities. I always end up so nervous around those sections... How very embarrassing.」


No, not, "How very embarrassing"...
I hear geniuses tend to be a bit eccentric, but I guess she's the same way...

I'll never be able to live it down if I fail something after being taught by someone like her.\n\r

I need to get pumped and work hard!
$$smh_OpenCHK
Long after the sun sets...
I'm having Okihara-senpai check over the worksheets I've finished.
％Ｂ
「...How are they?」
Misa
「Fufu... They're all correct!」

％Ｂ
「All right! I did it!」
Misa
「Excellent work!」
％Ｂ
「Man, I'm so tired... and thank you, Okihara-senpai, for all your help. I'm beginning to think I might be able to get through this, thanks to you.」


Misa
「You still have one more day left, so please use that time to review thoroughly.」

％Ｂ
「Y-Yes...」
That's right... I can't relax just yet.
％Ｂ
「Hahhh... But still, it's been a long time since I've concentrated on studying this much. I'm so tired...」

Especially since I've gone without much sleep these past few days while researching Marinpia...

％Ｂ
「I feel like I can really understand why people who do a lot of work just wanna go out on vacations every now and then.」

Misa
「I see, I see. I could see that as well.」

Misa
「Then... would you like to go?」
％Ｂ
「Uh... go?」
Misa
「On a vacation.」
％Ｂ
「...I'm sorry?」
Misa
「Would you like to go on vacation together after finals have ended? To my secret spot.」

％Ｂ
「To your... secret spot?」
Together, just the two of us?
Wh-What's up with the sound of that!? My heart's going crazy!
％Ｂ
「A-Are you... really sure?」
Misa
「Yes, of course.」
Okihara-senpai and I, alone together... on vacation!
Ooohh...!
Ooohhhh...!!
Ooooooooooooooohhhhhhhhhhh!!!
Misa
「But that won't be possible if you're in supplementary lessons, okay?」
％Ｂ
「...Yes, you're right.」
...I-I should work hard.
