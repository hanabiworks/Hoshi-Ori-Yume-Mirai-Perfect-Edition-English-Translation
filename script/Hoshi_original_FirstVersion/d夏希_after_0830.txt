「Ohh, this is so nostalgic!」
I cry out without thinking as soon as I see the school gates.
Shionagi First Academy. Our alma mater.
％Ｂ
「I feel like I haven't been here in forever.」
Natsuki
「That's 'cause you actually haven't been here in forever. I've been here a few times with Marika and the others to plan out the reunion, though.」


％Ｂ
「How are things inside? Has anything changed?」
Natsuki
「You can just see that for yourself. I wouldn't want to spoil things, would I?」

％Ｂ
「Good point.」
all
It's finally the day of our class reunion.
I don't see any of our other classmates yet.
Which makes sense. We're here an hour before it's scheduled to begin.

Shuuichi
「Yo. You're here.」
％Ｂ
「Hey, Shuuichi.」

Natsuki
「Morning, Nirasawa.」
Shuuichi
「Huh? What, you both came? 

Ryousuke's 
He's 
the only one who needed to come early.」
The people who were originally part of the event committee are supposed to do the setup for today.

Shinozaki and I are in charge of the reception.
％Ｂ
「Yeah, she apparently wants to start taking photos as soon as people start showing up.」

Natsuki
「I am a member of the grad-alb committee, after all!」
％Ｂ
「Man, I haven't heard you say that in a while.」
Shuuichi
「You're the same as ever, Segawa... Or wait, 
you're Hino too now
your name's different now
.」
Natsuki
「Segawa's fine. Or madam.」
Shuuichi
「Sure thing, madam... Actually, that feels kind of gross, so I'll go with Segawa.」

％Ｂ
「Are the other event committee members all here already?」
Shuuichi
「No, it's just us and a few others so far. Oh yeah, Shinozaki's here already.」

Natsuki
「Hey, can I go take some photos of the school building and stuff?」
％Ｂ
「Sure. But didn't you already take some when you came for the Tanabata Festival?」

Natsuki
「But there were lots of people back then. I didn't really get any opportunities to get shots of the building without anyone around. I'll see you in a bit, then.」


She start jogging over to the school.
For an instant, I can see her in her school uniform from all those years ago as she runs. My heart jumps a little.
Shuuichi
「She never changes, does she? All right then, let's get started on preparing.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, let's go.」
Marika
「Oh... 
Hino-kun!
Long time no see!
」
％Ｂ
「Yo, Shinozaki. Long time no see.」

Shuuichi
「What, you haven't talked to Shinozaki?」
％Ｂ
「Nope, 'cause Natsuki did all the planning. Though it seems like they were talking about stuff other than the reunion too.」


Marika
「Ahaha, Segawa-sa...
Hino-san
Natsuki-san
? told us lots. Sounds like you two are crazy in love.」

％Ｂ
「...? I thought you guys interrogated her?」
Marika
「We just asked her, "How's married life?" and she told us lots.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, really...」
Natsuki, you liar...
That girls' night wasn't an interrogation. You totally just blabbed about all that stuff yourself.

Shuuichi
「Are they really that crazy in love?」
Marika
「Mhm, she told us about how they split up the housework evenly, and they only need one pillow, and when they leave the house and come back they─」

％Ｂ
「Shinozaki... Stop... Please, no more...」
Marika
「Whaaat～? Why～?」
It's pretty embarrassing to hear someone else talk about it...
I mean, I was already prepared for a bit of teasing about our marriage.
But I still want to minimize any mental damage to myself.
Shuuichi
「No, Shinozaki. Keep talking about stuff like that. It'll be more fun for other people that way.」

％Ｂ
「Why, you...!」
Shuuichi
「You said getting messed with won't do anything to you, right?」
％Ｂ
「Gh... Y-Yeah... It's no big deal to me.」
Shuuichi
「Hear that? Counting on you, Shinozaki.」
Marika
「Okay, got it.」
Shuuichi
「Anyway, you two are going to do the reception like we planned. Check through the list of participants.」

all
The alumni arrive one after another while Shinozaki and I sit at the reception desk.

Marika
「Hellooo～ Your old class and name, please.」
％Ｂ
「The reunion is being held out on the grounds. We'll be starting at eleven o'clock, so feel free to walk through the school until then.」

We see some of our old classmates among the alumni, of course, and we just can't help but chat whenever it happens.

Alum 1
「Oh, Marika! Kyah～ It's been forever～!」
Marika
「Wow～ Yocchan～ Long time no see～」
％Ｂ
「Uh... May we get your previous class and name?」
Marika
「Oh, she's Yocchan, from my class～」
That's not enough information...
all
Alum 2
「Oh! Long time no see, man!」
％Ｂ
「Oh... Uh... Aizawa? Long time no see.」
Alum 2
「I heard you and Segawa got married, right?」
％Ｂ
「Y-Yeah... In April this year.」
Alum 2
「Must be nice to have it made like that! Go explode!」
％Ｂ
「Hahaha... See ya later, man.」
Marika
「There it was again～ I think that's the seventh person who's said something like that?」
％Ｂ
「Eighth... But it's fine, I expected this.」
Every single one of the alumni that I know mentions my marriage with Natsuki.

I don't feel bad about it of course, but it's a bit annoying to have to put up with it every time.

％Ｂ
「I bet Shuuichi put me on reception duty 'cause he knew this would happen. He's got the worst personality.」

Marika
「Y-You think so? I think it's just a coincidence?」
％Ｂ
「No, that's just the way he is.」
Rikka
「Great work over here.」
Marika
「Oh, Narusawa-san.」
％Ｂ
「Yo, Narusawa.」
all
Rikka
「Oh, so you're doing the reception. Thank you for trading places with me.」

％Ｂ
「Wha? Trading places...?」
Rikka
「It was originally supposed to be Shinozaki-san and me doing the reception. But Nirasawa-kun said I didn't have to because he was going to have an ex-event committee member do it.」


％Ｂ
「He specifically swapped you out?」
Which must mean Shuuichi actually did do this on purpose.
Rikka
「Shinozaki-san should have known about this too.」

I look at Shinozaki.
She averts her gaze at the same time.
％Ｂ
「...So you were in on it.」
Marika
「A-Anyway, Narusawa-san, you're going to play piano for us today, right～」

Hey. Don't try to gloss over it.
Rikka
「Yes, I've been asked to.」
Marika
「I'm excited because it's been so long since I've heard you play～ So what are you going to play?」

Rikka
「Let's see. How about a wedding march?」
％Ｂ
「Even you, Narusawa...?」
It's probably gonna be like this the whole day today...
Though I already knew that.
all
Shuuichi
「Err, hello everyone. Thank you all so very much for coming to this class reunion despite your busy schedules... Eh, there's no point in being this formal with you guys, right?」


Shuuichi
「It's been five years since we graduated from this school. Some of you are already working, some of you are still students, and I bet some of you don't fall into either of those categories.」


Shuuichi
「But, well, let's forget about that kind of stuff today. Let's go back to how we were back when we were high schoolers. You can reminisce over memories, or vent about your lives to each other. Let's just have a good time!」


all
Marika
「I wonder where Segawa-san's gone.」
Natsuki still hasn't come back, even though the reunion's started.

％Ｂ
「The heck is she doing...?」
Natsuki
「Man, thanks for waiting! Sorry I'm late!」
all
％Ｂ
「What were you doing?」
Natsuki
「I got too into the photography and lost track of time.」

Rikka
「Same as ever.」
Natsuki
「Oh, Rikka, those clothes are so nice. Can I take a picture?」

％Ｂ
「Just do it later...」
all
There are lots of events for our class reunion.
There's currently a band made up of a group of friends from the same year playing on stage.

Marika
「They're apparently going to be making their big debut this fall.」

％Ｂ
「Huh, I didn't know we had people like that in our year.」

Rikka
「They were originally part of the light music club. I saw them a few times back when we were still attending this school.」
Marika
「I also heard there's going to be a speech from someone who used to be in the baseball club who's a professional player now.」

％Ｂ
「A band making their big debut, a professional baseball player... Wait a second, that's Minami! Man, so he plays professionally now...」

That time Natsuki's advice helped him land that comeback home run's still a fond memory for me.
all
Turns out we had some pretty impressive people in our year.
Our fellow alumni made their dreams come true... It's really nice.
％Ｂ
「We'll need to do our best too, Natsuki.」
I look to my side to see... 
No one.
％Ｂ
「...What? Where'd Natsuki go?」
Marika
「Um... Over there.」
all
Natsuki
「I like it! I like iiit! The way she's just shredding away on that guitar! The precise, but bold movement of the fingers, strumming out that dignified beat! I think the sound might show through even in the photo!」


Oh, right... There's someone who's always running straight toward her dream right next to me.
％Ｂ
「...She really hasn't changed, has she?」
It's the grad-alb committee member Segawa Natsuki from back when we were in high school.
It's a nostalgic, but still vivid, and bright sight.
all
There's a bingo tournament after Narusawa's live piano performance.
After that, there are speeches from all of the homeroom teachers, and as the final event, Natsuki gets up on stage.

Natsuki
「I'm Hino Natsuki! I proposed this class reunion! Thanks for coming today, everyone! I hope you had fun!」


Natsuki
「I the one who proposed this class reunion, once-Segawa Natsuki! Thanks for coming today, everyone! I hope you had fun!」


Natsuki
「Our class reunion's over now, but there's something I want to talk to all of you about before we leave.」

Natsuki
「It's about the graduation album that we, the grad-alb committee, put together. I'm sure all of you still have yours, right? That album is actually based off of a certain concept.」


Natsuki
「And that concept is! It's "an album to connect together good memories."」

Natsuki
「Have all of you noticed that the last two pages of the album are blank?」

Natsuki
「Those pages are blank so we can add the new memories we've made since graduating.」

Natsuki
「So yeah, we're going to take a new photo right now to put in those blank pages! Gather up as much as you can, everyone!」


all
Everyone clusters together.
Natsuki
「Okay everyone, attention pleeease! This is for commemorating our first-ever class reunion, so look your best, okay? Ready? Here goooes!」


Everyone goes silent for a moment.
Natsuki
「Wait a second! How am I gonna be in the photo then!?」
Everyone laughs.
Natsuki takes a photo without missing a beat.
Natsuki
「Okay! You all had great smiles! Thank yooou!」
She beams and holds up her camera.
I bet everyone's thinking, "Oh, I get it..." right now.
They must've realized that this class reunion was planned out for the sake of this one photo.\n \n\r
That the girl up on stage who was once a graduation album committee member is still a graduation album committee member.

Natsuki
「I'll be sending this photo to everyone afterward, including the people who weren't able to come today. Make sure you all paste it onto the blank pages of your own graduation album.」


That she's connecting together the past to the present... and the present to the future.
Natsuki
「Also, once you paste this photo in, there'll still be enough blank space left for three more photos. Which means we're gonna do this class reunion at least three more times, so you all better be prepared!」


Everyone applauds.
She bows and starts to get off the stage.
Shuuichi
「Ah... Could you wait a second?」
Shuuichi's voice, amplified by a microphone, suddenly sounds out across the scene.
Shuuichi
「Sorry about this, Segawa, but could you stay right there?」
Natsuki
「Wha... Me?」
She looks confused, but she stays on stage as Shuuichi says.

％Ｂ
「What's going on...?」
Natsuki's looking at me curiously.
I tilt my head back at her.
I thought this class reunion was over once the photo was taken.
all
Shuuichi
「Hey everyone... Our graduation album's really something, don't you think? Normally, graduation albums are just something to look at and reminisce over your time as a student, right?」


Shuuichi
「But ours is "an album to connect together good memories." It's not just for looking back at the past. It's an album that's still being added to.」


Shuuichi
「You don't really get graduation albums that let you treasure your memories like that. Don't you think this is something like a treasure for us?」


Applause rings out again.
Shuuichi
「But there's just one thing missing from this treasure. You guys know what that is?」

all
Everyone looks from Shuuichi to Natsuki in unison.
Shuuichi
「That's right... There's just one important friend of ours who barely shows up in this album at all.」

Shuuichi
「She put herself second for the sake of preserving our precious memories, always taking photos for us.」

all
Shuuichi
「And thanks to that, she's barely in any photos other than group class photos. I guess you could see it as a good thing because it means she's passionate about her work, but you could also consider it a bit frustrating.」


Shuuichi
「But you know... It's thanks to that frustrating girl that we were able to keep connecting together our memories today.」

Shuuichi
「And that's not all. There are lots of us who owe her from back when we went to school here, right? Like some baseball club members who got themselves out of a rut after seeing the photos she took.」


Shuuichi
「Some of you had her take photos of the person you like, right? And some of you ended up dating that way, right?」


I can see people nodding here and there as Shuuichi talks.

Shuuichi
「There are some people who were in other years who really owe their school Tanabata Festival experience to her photos. And we're still making new memories thanks to her.」


Shuuichi
「I think we're all grateful to her to some extent. Am I wrong?」

all
Shuuichi
「So, you who were once known as Segawa Natsuki!」
Natsuki
「Y-Yes!?」
Shuuichi
「We're going to repay the favor now.」
Natsuki
「Repay the... Uh... I haven't heard anything about this...??」
Shuuichi
「Of course you haven't. We haven't told you anything. This is a surprise present, from us to you.」

all
Shuuichi
「But we'll need one more person for this present. Isn't that right, Hino Ryousuke?」

Shuuichi
「But we'll need one more person for this present.」
％Ｂ
「Wha... M-Me?」
I haven't heard anything about this either, of course.
But Natsuki and I must've been the only ones out of the loop, judging by how Shinozaki and Narusawa are giggling nearby...

Shuuichi
「Then let's start our final event for this class reunion! It's party time!」

all
Shinozaki and Narusawa get up on stage at Shuuichi's signal and grab Natsuki by the arms.

Natsuki
「Wawah!? W-Wait, what!? What's going on!?」
Marika
「It's fine, don't worry.」
Rikka
「I'll finally get to return the favor for when you dragged me to the event committee against my will.」

all
The two of them pull Natsuki off the stage and into the school building.
％Ｂ
「H-Hey... Natsuki?」
What on earth's going on?
Shuuichi
「You come this way.」
％Ｂ
「Wha...?」
Shuuichi grabs me by the shoulders and also leads me into the school building amidst applause and cheers.

％Ｂ
「Hey, what's going on? You never told me about any of this.」

Shuuichi
「Of course I didn't, it's a surprise. But this is our present to Segawa. You're just playing a supporting role. Segawa's the star of the show.」


％Ｂ
「A supporting role...?」
Shuuichi
「Here. Change into this, and make it fast.」
Shuuichi hands me a tuxedo.
％Ｂ
「...What!? 
W-Wait a second... Is this...?」
Shuuichi
「I told you, didn't I? We're gonna mess with you like crazy, so you better be prepared.」
He grins at me.
I'm greeted with applause after I come back wearing the tuxedo.

％Ｂ
「Ha... Haha...」
I have to admit, I'm nervous.
I already know what the surprise is.

％Ｂ
「Wha...?」
Nishioka
「That looks pretty good on you, Mr. Husband.」
％Ｂ
「Oh... Nishioka-sensei!? What are you doing here...?」
Nishoka
「Don't you remember? I said I'd be the cameraman for your ceremony.」

％Ｂ
「Wha... So then you came here just for...?」
Nishioka
「Exactly. But, just so you know, I'll be using these photos afterward.」
％Ｂ
「Are you planning on displaying―」
Cheers suddenly surge.
Followed by thunderous applause.
All of the alumni are looking at one specific point.
Nishioka
「And so the bride makes her appearance.」
Nishioka-sensei points her camera in the same direction.
The crowd of alumni parts as the applause continues.
And walking through the crowd is―
％Ｂ
「Oh...」
It's Natsuki, wearing a white dress.
My heart starts pounding away in my chest the moment I see her, and I can feel all the blood in my body go boiling hot.

Natsuki
「...」
Natsuki smiles a little hesitantly and bashfully as she slowly walks toward me.

Natsuki
「...
Ryousuke
Ehehe
.」
％Ｂ
「...」
Marika
「Come ooon, you have to say it out loud, or else she won't get how you feel～」

％Ｂ
「Uh... Uhh... Well... Y-You're beautiful... You really are... Yeah...」
Natsuki
「Mm... Thanks...」
She's genuinely so beautiful I can't speak.
How long has it been since my heart's beat this fast?
Shuuichi
「If the bride and groom would come this way.」
Shuuichi's standing up on stage, suddenly having changed into a priest costume.

％Ｂ
「Haha, they're even doing that for us? ...Let's go, Natsuki.」

Natsuki
「Mhm...」
We link arms and begin walking toward the stage.
A wedding march starts playing over from the piano.
I look to see it's Narusawa playing.
Natsuki
「Oh no... What am I going to do, I'm so happy... I think I'm about to cry...」

She speaks quietly as we walk.
％Ｂ
「...Me too.」
Natsuki
「Is it really okay for us to have something like this done for us? They all said it was to repay the favor, but I haven't done anything that deserves all this...」


％Ｂ
「...No, I'm sure you did. I think they've always been grateful toward you, and always will be.」

Natsuki
「But―」
％Ｂ
「Remember what you said to me before?」
％Ｂ
「You said photos don't just preserve the past. They can also connect the present with the future.」

％Ｂ
「You said you thought photos were amazing, from the bottom of your heart, for being able to do that.」

％Ｂ
「Those photos you've been taking all this time are connecting the us from back then to the us of now.」

％Ｂ
「But your photos don't just connect times together. They connect people together too.」

％Ｂ
「It's like Shuuichi said. There are lots of people who were helped by your photos.」

％Ｂ
「That's why they're all celebrating you. This is the power of your photos.」

Natsuki
「
Ryousuke
Ehehe
...」
We get up on stage.
Shuuichi
「...We will now begin the marriage ceremony for these two.」
The piano fades away, the applause dies down, and all goes quiet.
We're supposed to just be at school, but the air becomes solemn... as if we were in a church.

Shuuichi
「To the groom, Hino Ryousuke. Do you vow to take this woman as your wife, for better or for worse, for richer or for poorer, in sickness and in health...」


Shuuichi
「To the groom. Do you vow to take this woman as your wife, for better or for worse, for richer or for poorer, in sickness and in health...」


Shuuichi
「To love and cherish, until death do you part?」
％Ｂ
「...I do.」
Shuuichi
「To the bride, Segawa Natsuki. Do you vow to take this man as your husband, for better or for worse, for richer or for poorer, in sickness and in health...」


Shuuichi
「To love and cherish, until death do you part?」
Natsuki
「Yes... I do.」
Shuuichi
「We have now heard their promises for their love in the future. We bear witness to these words, and we will also acknowledge them.」


Shuuichi
「Those of you who approve of this union, please answer with unwavering applause.」
％Ｂ
「Haha... Wow. I didn't think they'd celebrate like this.」
Natsuki
「Mhm... I'm so happy... It's so wonderful...」
Shuuichi
「You may now kiss the bride.」
％Ｂ
「...Huh?」
In front of all these people...?
I'm hesitating before the mass of onlookers when Natsuki grips my hand.

Natsuki
「...Hey
, Ryousuke

.」
Yeah. That's right... There's nothing to be embarrassed of.
Our happiness is being celebrated this much, acknowledged this much...
All we need to do is give form to it.
％Ｂ
「...Natsuki.」
Natsuki
「Mhm...」
I hold her.
She quietly closes her eyes.
I slowly bring my face closer, and we―
