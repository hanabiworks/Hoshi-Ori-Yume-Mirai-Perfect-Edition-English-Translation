「...You've gotta be kidding me.」
Marika
「How... did this happen...?」
Misa
「...」
We all worked hard to fix the cloudy green water. And now, the tanks are―

％Ｂ
「...They're completely white.」
The water's an opaque white.
Natsuki
「First green, then white... What's going on?」
all
We've been trying the solutions that Misa-senpai came up with for getting rid of the algae these past three days.


We physically removed as much of the algae as possible, increased the number of tanks, reduced the number of fish per tank, and collected shrimp that would feed on the algae and placed them in the tanks.


We've done everything we can.
But...
Rikka
「But it's not green anymore, so doesn't this mean we've solved the algae problem?」

Touko
「But it's still cloudy... All we did was change the color.」

all
Sora
「...We need to know the reason for the white clouds. If it isn't algae, then what is it? Misa?」


all
％Ｂ
「Misa-senpai...?」
Misa
「...This is a phenomenon known as "clouding."」
％Ｂ
「Clouding...」
Misa
「It is not well known as to what conditions cause clouding.」

Rikka
「You mean we don't know why this happened?」
Misa
「We do not. There are several situations where it tends to occur. It happens most often after newly setting up a tank, or exchanging the water. Or when one washes filters or gravel, or replaces them with new ones.」


Misa
「In addition, it can also tend to happen when one feeds the fish too much, or when filtration is too slow, as is the case with algal growth.」

Touko
「I was careful about how much I fed them after that.」
Misa
「It still is not your fault, Touko-san. But the common factor between the two issues would be a reduction in the amount of filtering bacteria.」


％Ｂ
「Filtering bacteria?」
Misa
「Fish feces and leftover food release ammonia as they decay. Filtering bacteria break the ammonia down.」


Misa
「If the bacteria population falls, the cycle falls out of balance, leading to a suspension of organic material in the water. It also leads to an explosion in the populations of microorganisms.」


Misa
「Clouding may be caused by the dead remains of these microorganisms and filtering bacteria, as well as the feces and food that have not been broken down... That is what I have heard, but...」


Misa
「It is as of yet unknown what causes the population of filtering bacteria to decline, or what conditions cause the rapid increase in microorganism populations.」


Rikka
「Do you think it's because of something we did?」
Misa
「It is possible that the steps that we took to fix the water quality upset the balance.」

Touko
「So all the stuff we did to try to fix the algae growth problem was for nothing...」

Misa
「It is nothing more than possibilities. We do not know the true cause. Fortunately, clouding has no effect on the living conditions within the water.」


all
Natsuki
「Thank god that the fish are safe, at least.」
Sora
「...But we can't display them like this.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah... Ousaka's right. People won't be able to see inside the tanks like this. It'll make Ousaka's stars look blurry too.」


all
Marika
「Maybe we could just change out all the water～?」
all
Misa-senpai shakes her head at Shinozaki's suggestion.
Misa
「The water in a fish tank is like a living creature in and of itself. Resetting the water conditions would have a significant toll on the fish, and there is the possibility that other issues may also arise.」


Natsuki
「What about bringing the bacteria populations back up?」
Misa
「It would take a week minimum in order for the population to stabilize. It would not be possible in time for the festival.」


Touko
「Isn't there some kinda magic treatment that could solve this all in one go?」

all
Misa
「We could add a water quality control agent... but there is no sure guarantee that it would work. It would also exact its own toll on the fish...」


Rikka
「...It seems we're completely out of options.」
Misa
「Yes... We are.」
％Ｂ
「Misa-senpai, you can't say that―」
That's when I realize.
Her hands are shaking slightly.
％Ｂ
「Senpai...」
all
She's trying to act tough, but she might be horribly affected by this inside.

And of course she is...
We thought we solved the algae issue, but now we have this clouding that we don't know the cause of.\n\r

There's no way all these problems coming up one after another wouldn't make her doubt herself.
Sora
「...How should we fix it?」
all
Misa
「Let... me think...」
She falls into thought.
As amazing as she is, there might be nothing we can do at this point.

Misa
「Please give me some time. I will think of something.」
Marika
「But there isn't much time until...」
Misa
「Please don't worry. I'm sure we will be able to fix things. I will do something about this.」

She smiles at us reassuringly.
all
We decide to stop there for the day.
There's nothing we can do without a plan.
I stay behind with Misa-senpai after the others leave.
％Ｂ
「It's just one thing after another, isn't it? First the algae, and now this clouding.」

Misa
「...」
％Ｂ
「We still have four days though, so we'll manage. I'll look up some solutions too.」

Misa
「...」
％Ｂ
「So... you don't need to pretend anymore, Misa-senpai.」
Misa
「...」
％Ｂ
「It's just me here now.」
Misa
「Uuh... Hgh...」
...I thought so.
Misa
「What should I do... I don't... know how...」
She almost never shows doubt or worry in front of the others.

But once she stops holding back, her tears just start streaming out.

It was the same back when Marinpia's closure was brought up at the event committee meeting.

Misa
「Everyone worked so hard to create the aquarium... and this happens... And it's so close to the festival... Why would this happen... Hgh...」


％Ｂ
「Senpai...」
I hold her gently.
It's about all I can do for her right now.
Misa
「Hghh... A-Aauuh...」
I want to give her advice of some kind.
I want to help her!
But this isn't the kind of problem that I can handle.
I can make all the reassurances I want.
But that won't solve the problem before us.
And she wouldn't want empty promises either.
％Ｂ
「Misa-senpai... I'm sorry.」
Misa
「Sniff... No, it's fine... I also apologize, for making you worry.」

She must have figured out what I was thinking.

She pulls away and wipes her tears away with a handkerchief.
Misa
「Hahh... I apologize you had to see such a shameful sight again.」
％Ｂ
「It wasn't shameful...」
Misa
「I had been intending on holding it back... but I can't stop myself when it's just the two of us alone. I'm acting spoiled, aren't I?」


％Ｂ
「Well, I'm personally happy that you'd act that way around me... I'd be completely fine if you did it more, you know.」

Misa
「Ufufu. Thank you very much. It makes me very happy to hear that, but I cannot do that right now.」


Misa
「Either way, we should go home for the day as well. I will think on what we should do. There are still other options.」


She gives another tough smile.
I personally think it'd be okay if she didn't try to do everything herself...
％Ｂ
「Hmm... This site's got nothing too.」
I'm at home looking up solutions for clouding on the internet.

But every site just says that the precise reasons for clouding aren't known.\n\r

And it looks like that means there's no sure-fire countermeasure for it.
％Ｂ
「Looks like all you can do is trial-and-error methods. But we don't have that kinda time...」

There are only three days left until the festival, not counting today.
We don't have the time to suss out a method that way.
％Ｂ
「Why did this have to happen now?」
We all worked so hard to gather the fish and prepare the tanks.
We managed to secure a location and even got through a hurricane.
％Ｂ
「It's only a few days until the Tanabata Festival. Why do all these issues have to pop up now of all times? Dammit...」


I can't help Misa-senpai when it counts the most...
I hate how powerless I am.
％Ｂ
「Three more days... I guess accepting the risks and switching out the water all at once would be the fastest way...」

But there's no way Misa-senpai would do that...
％Ｂ
「...Speaking of, she said there were still other options. I wonder what she's got on her mind?」

Are there methods to fix this other than resetting the water or using some kind of chemical agent?
％Ｂ
「Hmm... None of these sites mention any other effective methods... It doesn't look like there's any way to―」

％Ｂ
「...Hm?」
A certain link catches my eye.
It's a private aquarium hobbyist's personal website.
There are lots of details on everything they did to fix a clouding issue in their own tanks.

And there's some surprising information here.
％Ｂ
「This... No, but...」
There's no guarantee we'd get the same results as this person if we did the same thing, considering we only have three days left.

％Ｂ
「And there's no way Misa-senpai would use a method like this, even if I did propose it...」
...No. She just might.
％Ｂ
「And more importantly, she has to know about this already.」
If it isn't possible to get rid of the clouding in three days...
％Ｂ
「Then I think... she'd pick this method.」
Because that would be the most Misa-senpai-like thing to do.
But I'm sure she's hesitating.
She has to be wondering if this is really the best method.
That's why she said she needed time.
％Ｂ
「...Well, there's only one thing I can do, then.」
And that's to make that hesitation go away.
I need to push her from behind, so she can make that decision.
It's... all I can do!
％Ｂ
「...All right.」
I grab my phone and start up LIME.
【％Ｂ】「Good evening. Sorry, #Nthis is sudden, but are #Nyou free for a bit #Ntomorrow? There's #Nsomething I want to #Nshow you.」
【Misa】「I have time. What do #nyou wish to show me?」
She responds immediately.
【％Ｂ】「It's a secret. Let's #Nmeet tomorrow at noon, #Nthen.」
【Misa】「Okay. Where should we #Nmeet?」
【％Ｂ】「I would like to meet at #NMarinpia, if possible. #NCould we go inside?」
【Misa】「The staff are no longer #Nthere, but I believe we #Nshould be able to if I #Nborrow the key from my #Nfather.」
【％Ｂ】「Thank you for putting #Nup with this. I'll see #Nyou tomorrow then!」
【Misa】「Okay. See you tomorrow.」
％Ｂ
「Okay. Next up...」
Time to talk to someone else.
It's Shuuichi next.
【％Ｂ】「This is sudden, but you #Nfree tomorrow?」
【Shuuishi】「I have plans tomorrow. #NSorry about that.」
【％Ｂ】「You're just going on a #Ndate with Kaori-san, #Naren't you?」
【Shuuishi】「How'd you know?」
【％Ｂ】「Sorry, but I need a #Nfavor.」
【％Ｂ】「I won't get in the way #Nof your date. You guys #Ncan go enjoy the rest #Nonce I'm done.」
【Shuuishi】「Fine. Tell me what you #Nwant.」
【Shuuishi】「I don't know what's #Ngoing on, but I'll help #Nout.」
％Ｂ
「...Man. Friends are great.」
