The Tanabata Festival dominates Shionagi today.
Everything feels different while I'm waiting for Touko at our usual meet-up spot.

$$smh_OpenCHK
Touko left for home this morning to prepare.
I'd be lying if I said I wasn't tired still... but thinking about spending time together with Touko blows my fatigue away.

Touko
「Thanks for waiting. Wow, you weren't late or anything.」
％Ｂ
「I almost overslept, to be honest. I guess I was more tired than I thought.」

Touko
「Ehehe, yeah, since we did it lots. I'm sure you were tired.」
She gently takes my hand.
Just that little action makes me so happy. I'm sure we're going to have a great time today.

Touko
「Wow, look at how big those decorations are. I didn't know this festival was going to be so big.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah. But our bamboo display gives those a run for their money, right?」

I recall the bamboo display from yesterday.
The feelings we packed into that won't lose to any others of their kind. I'm confident of that.

Touko
「Mhm, it made me really happy. Thanks.」
％Ｂ
「I'm glad you liked it. We'll need to thank all the others too.」
I think the reason I can still be together with Touko like this... is because of our connections with everyone.

I squeeze her hand tight, to try to communicate that to her without words.
％Ｂ
「You didn't wear your yukata? Lots of people are wearing theirs today.」
I see lots of girls wearing yukata around.
I'm sure everyone wants to take the opportunity to wear their yukata and have a good time for such a big festival.

Touko
「Th-That's because...! I wanted to wear mine too, you know! But I didn't have a choice!」

％Ｂ
「Wha...?」
Touko
「...Um, because we got it dirty yesterday. That's why I couldn't wear it today.」
％Ｂ
「...I apologize.」
What else can I do but apologize?
There's nothing I can do about what happened, as a guy...
Touko
「It's a shame, because you said I'd look good in that yukata too. Aw, man. I can't believe it got that dirty!」

％Ｂ
「Th-That's...! It's like, 'cause of the momentum, and I felt like... I couldn't stop myself! And you're talking too loud!」

Touko
「Ahaha! You don't have to get so freaked out. Anyway, so the yukata's in the wash right now. Let's come here with me wearing it next year, okay?」


It's a promise for next year.
It's Touko's way of saying she wants us to be together from now on too.
％Ｂ
「Yeah, let's do that. It's a promise.」
Touko
「Let's go then. We have to go around to lots of stalls today!」
The two of us separated from the noisy crowd, to somewhere we can be alone together.
Time flies whenever I spend it with Touko.
Touko
「...I've been thinking. About... what I should do from now on.」
％Ｂ
「Wha...?」
Touko
「I'm thinking... of being selfish. That I want to stay here... in Shionagi, at least until I graduate high school.」


Touko
「Because I want to be together with you, and with everyone else.


」
I... want that to happen too.
Nothing would make me happier than us not having to be separated.
％Ｂ
「Can you do that? I mean... I'd be happy if you could, obviously. Are you gonna ask them to let you live by yourself or something...?」

Touko
「No. Actually, I've got a bit of a good idea.」
％Ｂ
「...A good idea?」
Touko
「I told you that my mom and dad are from Shionagi, didn't I?」

％Ｂ
「Yeah. You said they were here from back when that time capsule was put in the old school building.」
Touko
「I asked my dad this morning, and my grandma and grandpa apparently still live here. It's a bit far from here, but it wouldn't be too far for me to commute to school.」


％Ｂ
「So you mean you could live there, and...!」
Touko
「Mhm. I think I won't have to move. Though I don't really even remember what my grandparents look like, since I only met them when I was small.」


Really, wow...!
So there's a chance we could still be together from now on...!
Touko
「I'll have to convince my mom and dad first, though. I have no idea what they'll say, since I've never asked them for something like this.」


％Ｂ
「Tell me if there's anything I can do! I know, maybe I could round up Shinozaki and the others and we could all go to ask them together!?」

Touko
「Mmm... That might be a good idea. They'd probably be really happy, since I've never brought friends over before.」


Touko
「But instead of that, don't you think you could just go for it instead
, Ryousuke

?」

％Ｂ
「Huh? Go for it...?」
Touko
「You're the number one reason I want to stay in Shionagi. So if I tell them about that, then that means we'd be telling that we're dating, right?」


％Ｂ
「Well... Yeah, that's true.」
Touko
「A boy going to speak to a girl's father only makes you think of one thing, right?」

I can think of exactly one thing I would say.
It's the classic among classics. "I would like your daughter's hand in marriage!"
％Ｂ
「...Oh man.」
Am I standing at a critical juncture in my life right now...?
I haven't even proposed to Touko yet! And I have to get her parents to approve of us getting married first...!?

Touko
「Could you come with me? I think my dad might consider it if we said it straight.」

％Ｂ
「St-Straight?」
Touko
「Hehe... Can I see you show your manly side?」
Touko's smile changes to a fiendish request.
I can't not do anything now that she's expecting that of me.
I wouldn't be a man if I hesitated here...!
％Ｂ
「...All right, I'll do it! I'm ready! I'll show your parents just how much of a man I am!」

Touko
「Wh-What!? Wait, no, I was kidding! It's too early to talk to them about that!」

％Ｂ
「It doesn't matter whether it's early or late or whatever! I'm gonna have to talk to them about it at some point anyway, so I'll get it over with early!」


I've already got my future planned out, and I'm resolved!
All that's left is to see just how much I can communicate my passion and feelings!
Touko
「Stop, stop! Sorry, I went too far! Let's calm down, okay!?」

She frantically stops me as I pull out my phone to start looking for gifts to bring her parents for the occasion.
I probably would've ordered something if she had been any slower in stopping me.

Touko
「Geez... You're unexpectedly impulsive, you know that? Don't you think you should be a little calmer about things?」

％Ｂ
「You're saying that to me...? You're the one who needs to fix that habit of just disappearing suddenly. It's always so much work looking for you.」


Touko
「I can't help it. That's just the way I am. If you don't want me to do that, then you should just keep a tight hold on me.」

She takes my hand and slides her fingers between mine.
Seeing her smile as she waits for my reaction's unbelievably cute.
I grip back tightly, so she can't pull away.
Let's keep a tight hold on her, just like she says.
Touko
「...About what you said earlier. You said it's something you'll need to talk with them about someday?」


％Ｂ
「...Yeah.」
My face feels hot.
It might just be me, but I feel like Touko's cheeks are more flushed than the colors of sunset would be responsible for too.

Touko
「Ehehe, really. I'll be waiting, okay?」
Touko and I parted ways after promising to go to the Tanabata Festival tomorrow too.\n \n\r
She's apparently going to talk to her parents about it starting tonight, and she said she'd keep discussing it with them until they reach a conclusion she's satisfied with.

％Ｂ
「I hope she can make it work...」
There's nothing I can do about things related to her family.
I know that, and I was prepared to accept everything... but I can't help but be selfish now that I know there's a possibility.

％Ｂ
「...I think I might be wishing for a bit too much this year.」
I'll owe you my share for the next few years. So please.
I wish to the stars gleaming above.
％Ｂ
「...I wish for Touko to be able to stay by my side.」

The next day.
I nervously wait for Touko at our meet-up spot.
Touko never contacted me last night.
I considered reaching out to her, but I didn't want to get in the way in case they were still in the middle of talking.

I'm worried about how things turned out.
Whether things are looking good, whether they're the same... or whether they're bad.

％Ｂ
「...She isn't here yet?」
It's past the time we agreed on, but Touko hasn't arrived yet.
Maybe... it didn't go well...?
And she's finding it hard to face me because of that...?
％Ｂ
「Oh, there she is!」
_00cutinBS
I spot Touko on the other side of the crowd.
I start to walk toward her, but I stop. Relief and nervousness simultaneously dominate my heart.

_00cutinBS
Touko
「Sorry, I overslept a little...!」
Touko runs over, panting.
She looks the same as usual... I wonder how the discussion went last night.
％Ｂ
「...How'd things go last night?」
Touko
「...Let's talk while we walk. It's the last day of the festival, so we should have fun.」

all
Touko
「I tried talking about it to my mom and dad. That I have lots of people here who are important to me... so I wanted them to let me stay in Shionagi at least until I graduate.」

％Ｂ
「So what'd they say...?」
Touko
「...They said okay. They were so okay with it that I almost fell over.」

％Ｂ
「So that means... We can still be together from now on...?」
Touko
「Mhm. For next semester, for fall and for winter... and for next year's Tanabata Festival too. I can be by your side for all of that

, Ryousuke

.」
Really. Really...!
I just barely stop myself from hugging her tight out of joy.

Touko
「My dad was so happy. He was apparently feeling guilty about how I had to keep everything inside because of all of the moving we did.」

％Ｂ
「I see. So they weren't surprised or mad or anything?」
Touko
「Ahaha, I was the one who was surprised. I've never asked them for something like that before.」

Touko
「He told me, "We're always home late, and you always came with us without any complaints. We're really grateful to you." ...He cried a bit.」

％Ｂ
「...You've got a good dad.」
Touko
「He said, "You should make good memories with the people you think are important to you." He also said he was glad the key to the old school building came in handy.」

％Ｂ
「Speaking of which... I've been wondering. Why did your dad have that key?」

I've been wondering all this time.
Sure, he's an alumnus from our school. But why did he have the key to the old school building when he was just a student at the time?

Touko
「He apparently snuck it out because he'd need it for when they reopened the time capsule. And then after that they ended up not being able to come back to open it because of all of the moving we did.」


％Ｂ
「Oh, I see. And so he handed it to you after he came back to Shionagi.」

Touko
「Right. He said he wanted me to make at least a few memories in the place that they spent time in and associated with good memories.」

％Ｂ
「Haha, I guess he's just as mischievous as you are.」
Touko
「Mhm, my mom yells at him a lot for it. I guess I get that side of me from him.」

I'll need to thank him when I meet him.
If Touko hadn't had that key... I'm sure we never would've met.

Touko
「And my mom supported me too. "We'll be worried and lonely, but you're an adult now, so you need to make your own choices." They were both crying. I didn't really know what to do.」


％Ｂ
「That means they care about you just that much. You should be grateful to them for being supportive.」

Touko
「Mm, yeah. And, um...」
％Ｂ
「Hm? What are you acting so embarrassed for?」
Touko
「I told them... everything about you too
, Ryousuke

. That I wanted to stay with the boy who was most important to me.」

％Ｂ
「...」
Saying it that way's pretty much the same as a proposal...
The bar's only getting higher for when I actually meet them...
Touko
「And then my mom and dad started talking about the past together... I was forced to listen to their love talk until late at night, and that's why I overslept. And I am still very sleepy, thanks to that.」


％Ｂ
「...How am I supposed to follow up on that?」
Touko
「That's for you to figure out
, Ryousuke

. You'll just have to spoil me rotten with love so we don't lose to my mom and dad's love stories.」


I have absolutely no idea what's being expected of me...!
It's pretty freakin' scary to not know how much people want out of you, you know...!

Touko
「So anyway, I'll be living at my grandma and grandpa's place. I talked a little with them about it too, and they were really happy.」


％Ｂ
「That's good. You said it was a bit far, but how far exactly?」

Touko
「Mmm... It's about an hour away by train, so I think it might be hard for us to go to school together or see each other whenever we want like we've been doing until now.」


That's nothing compared to what it could've been otherwise if she had to move away.\n\r

I don't see even the slightest amount of gloom in Touko's expression either.
Touko
「But... that's nothing at all if I can stay together with all of you. I'll have to go shopping with them, and make them fried eggs... I need to make those wishes come true.」


％Ｂ
「Yeah, you do. Starting with summer break and next semester... You're probably gonna be pretty busy.」

Touko
「I'm not really sure about the photo collection, though. I'm still embarrassed about photos. I'm not used to them.」

We can make promises for the future and imagine doing things together.
It might be a minor thing, but it makes me unbelievably happy.

Touko
「Oh, right. I have a message to you from my mom and dad.」

％Ｂ
「Huh? A message... to me?」
Touko
「They said they want you to come over before they move away. They want to see the person their daughter says is most important to her.」

％Ｂ
「Wha...?」
Touko
「My dad was like, "I've always dreamed of drinking together with a son!" Though I told him it was still too early for that.」


Touko
「I showed my mom a picture of you, and she said you looked cool. She's looking forward to meeting you.


」

...The bar's been raised to quite the height now.
How much is the Yukimura household expecting out of me at this point...?
Touko
「You said you were prepared yesterday, right? Isn't it great that you get to do it after all?」

％Ｂ
「Don't say it so casually! You'd be nervous to meet my parents too, wouldn't you!?」

Touko
「Mmm... I think I'd want to meet them, though? I wanna hear them talk about you as a kid.」

Touko
「Mmm... I think I'd want to meet them, though? I wanna hear them talk about you as a kid.」

％Ｂ
「...I forgot about how nothing fazes you.」
Touko
「Next week's a holiday for the Bon Festival, so around then would work best. My mom's already excited about making dinner for when you come.」

％Ｂ
「The date's already decided!? And it's next week!?」
Touko
「Your parents are going to be here by the end of summer break too, right? Ehehe, I'm excited.」

Touko
「Your parents are going to be here by the end of summer break too, right? Ehehe, I'm excited.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, they are... but I haven't told them anything yet, you know.」

Touko
「Mmm... It'd be rude to just suddenly come over, right? Though coming over without any warning and explaining things sounds fun too.」


％Ｂ
「F-Fine, I get it! I'll tell them tomorrow... no, tonight!」
My parents are coming back to Shionagi next week.
I still haven't told them about Touko because it's kinda embarrassing, but now's not the time for that.

Touko
「I need to make plans to hang out with everyone too. Segawa-san... Mm, that's kinda hard to say. Camera-chan said all the girls should go out together.」


％Ｂ
「Wha, Segawa said that?」
Touko
「Mhm. She was all excited. Like, "I'm not gonna let you two just go on dates all the time!"」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, I think that sounds great. You should make more memories with friends too.」

Touko
「Like going shopping, or to the beach... There's lots of things I want to try. I've actually always wanted to sit in a family restaurant all day just to talk with people, just a bit.」


％Ｂ
「That's not something guys really do. We only ever think of doing active stuff.」

Touko
「I want to do special things together with you
, Ryousuke

... but I want to do normal things with the others too.」

Touko
「Because having fun with other girls sounds fun too. Ehehe... I'm going to do everything I haven't been able to do until now!」

I feel like Touko's smile is shining even brighter.
It must be because she's genuinely excited to do all that, from the bottom of her heart.
Touko
「Hey, what do you wanna do tomorrow?」
％Ｂ
「What? Planning for tomorrow already?」
Touko
「Because I still have looots of stuff I wanna do together with you! See, first...!」

％Ｂ
「Hahh... It's so hot again this year...」
I can feel the sunlight sizzling on my skin.
It's about the same as last year... No, I think it might be hotter.
Students busy themselves with preparations out on the grounds.
Shionagi Academy's Tanabata Festival's looking to be a big hit again this year.
Touko
「It's been a year already... It's so nostalgic.」
We've been together for a year now.
I've spent the past year being swung around by Touko's carefree ways, just like always.
Touko's still wearing that school uniform she likes even after she ended up not having to transfer, saying, "It's a precious keepsake."

I'm used to seeing her like this anyway, and it makes her really easy to spot when she just up and disappears.\n\r

Her wearing a different uniform from everyone else is unexpectedly convenient.
Touko
「I remember we were busy like that too.」
％Ｂ
「No, you were just wandering around. You were playing with stray cats and stuff while I was talking to people, remember?」

Touko
「...Was I? Oh, but I stamped lots of paperwork. I think I could still do it pretty well, even now.」

Stop miming that.
I'm never gonna forgive you for stamping my forehead while I was asleep the other day...

all
I recall the painful memory.
She couldn't possibly understand how I felt when I showed up in class, almost late, with my own last name stamped onto my forehead.

I remember Segawa saying, "I know who you are! Ahahahahah!" as she clutched her belly and fell on the floor laughing.

And Narusawa was like, "D-Don't come this way! Pff... pffh...!"

Touko
「Oh, look! It's a bamboo display! I'm gonna make the first wish this year!」

...She changed the subject.
She must have sensed the bitterness in my gaze. She immediately looks at a bare bamboo display.

％Ｂ
「Hm? What's that?」
Touko
「I decided I'm going to use this instead of a tanzaku this year.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, that's...」
A fragment of a place that was precious to us.
The key to the old school building that's already been torn down.

Touko
「I don't need this anymore, right? So I wanted to use this as a tanzaku... so I could express my gratitude too.」


％Ｂ
「I get it. Yeah, I think that's great.」
Touko was depressed for a while after they started tearing down the old school building.
I did my best to cheer her up, but Shinozaki and the others were the ones to get her back to usual.

There are some things that only they can do, as fellow girls.
They constantly supported Touko, telling her, "You're not alone."
Touko
「There we... go. Thanks for everything. I can still be together with everyone... because I had you. I'm very grateful.」


％Ｂ
「I'm grateful too. Thanks... for supporting Touko all this time. I'll support her in your place from now on.」


Touko
「...Mhm. I'm not alone anymore... so it's okay. That's why... today is goodbye.」

Because she doesn't need to depend on a place where she can be alone anymore.
The bamboo and key rustle in the wind, as if to laugh in joy for her resolve.

Touko
「...I hope my wish this year comes true.」
％Ｂ
「What'd you wish for?」
Touko
「It's a secret. Don't you think there's a better chance of it coming true if I don't tell anyone?」
％Ｂ
「Come on, just tell me. Actually, now that I think about it... I don't know what your wish was last year either. What'd you end up wishing for?」


Touko
「Ahaha, that's a secret too! I'll tell you if it comes true!」

all
％Ｂ
「Agh, hey! Don't run away, Touko!」
all
I was referring to the capsule matching mine that I gave her last year.
Looks like... I won't get to know its contents for a little while longer.
The summer sky is beautifully blue.
There's a zero percent chance of rain today, according to the weather forecast.
Tonight, I'm going to wish upon a sky full of stars.
There's just one wish for me to make tonight.
For me to be able to stay together with Touko... now and forever.
