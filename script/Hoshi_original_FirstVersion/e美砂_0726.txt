Misa
「...」
Misa-senpai's looking at the sky.
％Ｂ
「Is something wrong?」
Misa
「...The wind has started to pick up. It appears a hurricane is coming.」

％Ｂ
「Wha... You can tell? Can you predict that from the wind once you're that knowledgeable...?」


Marika
「They were saying it on the weather forecast this morning～」
％Ｂ
「Oh... I get it now.」
all
I pull out my phone and check the weather.
％Ｂ
「You're right. It looks like there's a big hurricane approaching us. It appears to be on a direct collision course.」


Misa
「I see, I see... The wind will get stronger this evening and rain will come by nightfall. I was hoping it would deviate from its course, but it appears not.」


She's peering at my phone to see the newest updates on the weather.
all
Natsuki
「Don't hurricanes get you kinda excited?」
Touko
「Oh, I get what you mean. I always feel like I do when it's the day before a field trip.」

Sora
「...You can see the stars clearly once the clouds part after a hurricane.」
all
Rikka
「...It must be nice to be so carefree.」
％Ｂ
「Anyway, we probably shouldn't do too much work today, then. That way, we can all go home before it starts raining.」

Rikka
「I know I'll be going home before then.」
all
％Ｂ
「That's fine with you too, right, Senpai?」
Misa
「...」
She's thinking about something. She looks worried.
％Ｂ
「Senpai?」
Misa
「What? ...Oh, yes.」
％Ｂ
「Is something the matter?」
Misa
「Well, umm... I believe I may be worrying too much...」
％Ｂ
「Please tell me. Perhaps I could help.」
Misa
「Yes... I'm slightly worried about the fish.」
Natsuki
「...I know it's supposed to be a big hurricane, but there's no way the entire building's gonna get blown away, right?」
Misa
「I'm worried about blackouts. If a blackout causes the fans or air pumps to stop working, the water temperature will rise, which will cause anoxia.」


Misa
「I believe just one night should be fine, but...」
all
Touko
「But if a blackout happens, then it'll be tonight during the hurricane, won't it? I don't think there's anything we can do about it.」

Rikka
「And it isn't like we can come check in the middle of the hurricane.」
Sora
「...Staying the night at school would be efficient.」
all
Misa
「Yes, exactly.」
Marika
「What? ...Are you serious?」
Misa
「Yes. That is what I will have to do, since there is no other option.」
％Ｂ
「J-Just a second. You're not actually planning on staying the night here, are you?」

Misa
「Of course I am! This isn't something I could ask someone else to do.」
％Ｂ
「Well, but... aren't you going to be afraid?」
I say the latter half in a low voice so she can save face.
Misa
「Uuuh... B-But... I can't allow myself to leave them by themselves!」

％Ｂ
「I understand how you feel, but...」
As for me, I can't let her stay the night alone in a place like this.
But we can't just abandon the fish either...
％Ｂ
「...I'll stay.」
Misa
「What? B-But, that would be...!」
％Ｂ
「I'm the only option, aren't I? There's no way we can let just one girl stay the night here.」

Misa
「Y-Yes, that's why I will―」
％Ｂ
「What are you saying? You're a girl too.」
Misa
「Then I will stay here with you!」
％Ｂ
「Your parents would just be angry with me if you did that. And we'd be in a heap of trouble if the school found out that both of us stayed the night here.」


％Ｂ
「If it's just me that stays behind, then I can at least make up an excuse, like I got caught up in preparing for the Tanabata Festival and ended up trapped here.」

Touko
「That's a boy for you. Very cool!」
％Ｂ
「Oh, shut up.」
Misa
「...Is it really okay?」
％Ｂ
「Yes. It's just one night. Please let me handle this.」
Misa
「...I understand. Then... I apologize, but please do.」
％Ｂ
「Now that that's decided, please tell me what I should do in the case of a blackout.」

all
％Ｂ
「We got what we need, Misa-senpai.」
Misa
「Thank you very much.」
We left to go buy flashlights, a rechargeable fan, and an air pump, as per Misa-senpai's instructions.


Marika
「It's already starting to rain a bit. We need to charge these quick...」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. Let's get on that right now.」
all
We immediately start charging the fan and pump.
These are apparently for preventing an increase in water temperature during a blackout.
Natsuki
「Can we really cool down all of these tanks with just one fan?」
Misa
「...To tell the truth, I believe it may be only temporary peace of mind. This would only be an emergency measure with which we would bide time during a blackout...」

％Ｂ
「I'll use this if I have to.」
all
I hold up a handheld fan.
％Ｂ
「If the electric fan's not enough, then I'll use this to make wind to cool down the tanks even more myself!」

Rikka
「...How primitive.」
Touko
「So let's say you can manage on the temperature front. What about air? There's not going to be enough oxygen in the water if the pumps stop, right?」

all
Misa
「This will be used in that case.」
She takes out the hand-operated air pump from the bag.
Misa
「This pump can be attached to a typical plastic bottle. One pumps it by hand to build pressure within the bottle, which then pushes air through this tube.」


Rikka
「More and more primitive...」
Sora
「...Looks tiring.」
％Ｂ
「It's an emergency tool, so yeah. There won't be any issues if there's no blackout in the first place.」

Misa
「Yes... It would be nice if there weren't one, of course...」
all
Natsuki
「Hey. It's really starting to pour outside.」
all
I can hear the rain battering against the window.
And then a schoolwide broadcast starts.
Yamashita-sensei
『This is Yamashita, the extracurricular adviser. There will be a large-scale hurricane approaching the city today. Those of you who are still at school, please go home as soon as possible. To repeat―』


％Ｂ
「All right. I'll take care of the rest, so you guys should all go home now.」

Misa
「Um... Are you really sure about this?」
％Ｂ
「Don't worry. It's just one night. Plus, the hurricane still might end up changing course.」

Misa
「Please let me know immediately if anything happens. Even the most trivial thing.」

％Ｂ
「I understand.」

Natsuki
「You make sure Yamashita-sensei doesn't catch you.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, I know.」
all
He'd shoo me out of the school if he did.
I've gotta hide until all the teachers leave.
Marika
「You can talk to all of us on LIME if you get lonely, okay?」
％Ｂ
「Oh, come on... I'm not a kid.」
all
Touko
「Good luck, then.」
Rikka
「See you tomorrow.」
Sora
「...Bye-bye.」
all
Misa
「Then... I leave the rest to you.」
％Ｂ
「Yes. I'll handle all of it.」
all
％Ｂ
「...It's getting real rough out.」
I take out my phone and look at the weather again.
％Ｂ
「Ack... That's a ton of warnings.」
We might seriously get a blackout at this rate.
％Ｂ
「Might as well turn on the lights now.」
I doubt there's still anyone here at this point.
％Ｂ
「Phew... That livens things up a bit.」
Hiding alone in a pitch-black room was just a bit scary, I have to say.

％Ｂ
「I'm hungry. Guess I'll eat.」
I bought some rice balls for dinner from a convenience store when we went out to get the fan and stuff earlier.

％Ｂ
「Let's eat... Hamh... Mgmgh...」
％Ｂ
「Ah...?」
A LIME message... Who's it from?
【Misa】「The weather seems to #Nhave gotten quite #Nrough. Is everything #Nokay?」
％Ｂ
「Haha... After I told her I'd be fine, too. She's a real worrywart.」

I guess that means she's just that worried for my sake?
【％Ｂ】「I'm fine. I'm eating #Nright now.」
【Misa】「I meant the fish...」
％Ｂ
「...Riiight.」
【％Ｂ】「The fish are okay too. #NThere haven't been any #Nblackouts yet. I think #Neverything's going to #Nbe okay.」
【Misa】「Thank you very much. I #Napologize for asking #Nsomething so ridiculous #Nof you.」
【％Ｂ】「You don't need to #Napologize. Someone had #Nto do it.」
【Misa】「I'm still slightly #Nregretful. I believe I #Nshould have been the #None to stay...」
【％Ｂ】「Am I that hard to #Ndepend on?」
【Misa】「Not at all. I'm just #Nashamed of myself for #Nhaving you do it alone.」
【％Ｂ】「I'd be the one who'd be #Nashamed if our #Npositions were reversed.」
【％Ｂ】「I could never let a #Ngirl stay here alone #Nwhile I went home. So #Nthis is fine by me.」
【Misa】「That does put me just a #Nlittle at ease. But... #Nisn't it scary?」
【％Ｂ】「Nope, not at all! Being #Nat school at night's #Nactually pretty neat. #NI'm having a good time!」
【Misa】「You're very strong... #NI'm sure I would be #Nhorribly afraid if I #Nwere the one there.」
【Misa】「I may have been #Nshivering with fear #Nfrom the sound of the #Nwind and rain...」
【％Ｂ】「I'd come running to you #Nright away if that were #Nthe case. #NIf it's for you, #N"Through the rain, #Nthrough the wind..."」
【Misa】「"Through snow, through #Nsummer's heat. With a #Nsturdy body..." A Dazai #Nquote, yes?」
【％Ｂ】「I'm just so impressed #Nyou replied with #Nsomething like that #Nimmediately...」
【Misa】_st_0218
【Misa】「And thank you very #Nmuch. I'm very happy #Nthat you would say #Nsomething like that for #Nme.」
【Misa】「It feels like... I'm #Nreally loved.」
【％Ｂ】「Of course it does. #NBecause I do love you!」
％Ｂ
「Oh god... That's kinda embarrassing...」
Maybe it's because of the circumstances, and the fact that I actually wrote it out.
I feel kinda weird about what I typed out.
％Ｂ
「Crap... She's stopped responding. Maybe she doesn't know how to respond to that?」

I might've gotten a little too carried away...
【Misa】「I... love you too.」
％Ｂ
「...」
I can tell that my face is getting redder and redder.
【％Ｂ】「I'm bright red right #Nnow...」
【Misa】「Yes... Me too...」
【％Ｂ】「You didn't have to #Nforce yourself to send #Nthat.」
【Misa】「It must be because it's #NLIME. I sent it without #Nreally thinking.」
【％Ｂ】「I'd like to hear the #Nsame words from you #Ndirectly next time.」
【Misa】「...I can do it when #Nwe're alone together.」
％Ｂ
「Khh... Man, that makes me happy.」
All right, time to reply―
％Ｂ
「Wha...!?」
All of the lights go out all at once.
The room lights, the tank lights, and the LED constellations.
％Ｂ
「You've gotta be kidding me...」
I know we were talking about how a blackout might happen, but to be honest, I wasn't entirely convinced.\n\r

I didn't think it would actually happen.
％Ｂ
「But it's a good thing I stayed here, then... All right.」
I put my phone down and grab a flashlight.
I walk over to the electric fan.
％Ｂ
「Didn't think I'd really end up using this either.」
I remove the charging cable and throw the pump into the water.
I turn on the electric fan. A decidedly mild air current starts up.

％Ｂ
「Yeah, this really isn't gonna do much.」
But it's better than nothing.
I put the flashlight down on a table and hold the electric fan with both hands.
I point it toward one of the tanks at the end of a row.
I move it slowly, making sure the wind hits each of the tanks evenly.

％Ｂ
「Hope this ends before the charge runs out.」
％Ｂ
「Still isn't over...」
I dunno how long it's been since the blackout's started.\n \n\r

I can't check my phone either, since I have both hands full.
It could be anywhere between twenty minutes or an hour from how it feels...
％Ｂ
「And... it's so hot in here.」
The room's only getting warmer and warmer with all of the windows being closed.
％Ｂ
「Whoa!?」
The fan almost slipped out from my hands because of my sweat.
％Ｂ
「Phew... That was close.」
I realize that I'm covered in sweat.
％Ｂ
「This isn't good... That probably means the water temperature's gone up a lot too.」
I can tell the electric fan's weakening too.
If this blackout doesn't end soon, I'm gonna actually have to flap a fan to cool these tanks down.
％Ｂ
「Right, the hand-operated pump!」
I put the fan down and grab the pump.
I pump it over and over to build up pressure, place the end of the tube in a tank, and bubble air in.

％Ｂ
「Kh... This is a lot of work.」
All this pumping's only making me sweat more.
Looks like it takes about seventy pumps or so to fully compress the air.

％Ｂ
「If I'm gonna do this for the other tanks... This is gonna be pretty rough.」
I won't have to as long as the fan's still running, but once it stops...
I'll have to flap a fan over the tanks while pumping air in...

％Ｂ
「I seriously hope the blackout ends before that happens... Come on, electric companies!」

％Ｂ
「A-A call? H-Hello?」

I put the fan down.
I grab my phone and accept the call without even looking at the screen.
Misa
『This is Misa!』
％Ｂ
「Oh... Misa-senpai!?」
Misa
『I apologize... You suddenly stopped responding on LIME, so I thought something may have happened...』

％Ｂ
「Oh, uh... Well... Actually, we've got a bit of a blackout over here at school.」
Misa
『So it really did happen?』
％Ｂ
「Yes, but I'm sure it'll be over soon... That electric fan's real helpful, hahaha. And using the pump's actually pretty fun too...」


Misa
『...』
％Ｂ
「Misa-senpai?」
Misa
『...You're breathing heavier. You seem tired.』
％Ｂ
「Do I now? Either way, I'm totally fine by myself over here, so...」
I try to sound as casual as possible.
It's Misa-senpai we're talking about. I wouldn't be surprised if she tried to come help in the middle of the hurricane if she got worried.

Misa
『Is that true?』
％Ｂ
「Y-Yes... More or less.」
Misa
『...』
She's silent.
Misa
『...Um.』
％Ｂ
「Y-Yes?」
Misa
『...I am your girlfriend, aren't I, Ryousuke-san?』
Misa
『...I am your girlfriend, aren't I?』
％Ｂ
「What? ...Yes, of course...」
Misa
『Are things... really okay over there?』
If she says it that way...
％Ｂ
「...」
％Ｂ
「I feel like... I may be just a bit overwhelmed, yes.」
...Then what else can I do but tell her the truth?
Misa
『...』
_smh_st_04
％Ｂ
「What? ...The call ended? Hello?」

Did she hang up? What happened just now?

％Ｂ
「B-But... I need to focus on the tanks right now!」
I pick up the fan again.
％Ｂ
「Huh?」
I press the power button, but the fan doesn't move.
And I don't see the foam from the pump either.
Looks like they've both run dry.
％Ｂ
「So it's come down to physical strength in the end!」
I put the electric fan down and grab the fan and hand-operated pump.
％Ｂ
「Hahh, hahh... Th-This sucks...」

...How long's it been since I switched from the electric fan?
I'm covered in sweat, fanning the tanks.
I'm also keeping up a steady stream of air.
％Ｂ
「My arms are gonna give out at this rate... Come on, electric companies! I'm counting on you guys! I'll do my best over here too!」


％Ｂ
「Whoa, what!? Light...!?」
Everything goes bright for an instant. I squint. Have my prayers been answered?

％Ｂ
「...Hm?」
The light was from outside the window.
Just for a few seconds. Now there are only afterimages burnt into my retinas.
％Ｂ
「...What was that just now?」
％Ｂ
「Wha...?」
Now I can hear something from out in the hallway.
％Ｂ
「It-It's getting closer...!?」
Misa
「Ryousuke-san!」
Misa
「I apologize for the wait!」
That's...?
％Ｂ
「―Gueh!?」
Misa-senpai comes running into the room and throws her arms around me.

Misa
「I'm so sorry! I took far too long...!」
％Ｂ
「W-Wait, uh... Why are you here?」
Misa
「Because you told me you were overwhelmed! So I knew I had to come here, as soon as I could!」

％Ｂ
「Wh-What? Because of something like that?」
Misa
「It was not just something like that! I thought it must have been quite serious!」

％Ｂ
「...You're very sharp.」
Misa
「Why didn't you just tell me?」
％Ｂ
「I thought I might be able to pull through alone...」

％Ｂ
「And I know what you're like, so I thought you might come here in the middle of the hurricane if I complained...」

Though that's what ended up happening anyway.
Misa
「Of course I would.」
％Ｂ
「Yes... You're worried about the fish, after all.」
Misa
「No. I'm worried about you, Ryousuke-san!」
Misa
「No. I'm worried about you!」
％Ｂ
「Wha... Me?」
Misa
「I'm worried about the fish too, of course... but I'm much more worried about you overexerting yourself. And look at you, you're just covered in sweat...」


％Ｂ
「...I'm sorry.」
Misa
「I appreciate you being considerate of me. But you should know that I feel just as much the same about you.」


％Ｂ
「Huh?」
Misa
「And of course I do. Because I am your―」
？？？
「Ahem! Ahhemh! Harrumph!」
％Ｂ
「Uh...?」
all
There's someone standing in the doorway.
Misa
「Oh... Father.」
％Ｂ
「Wha... F-Father...?」
all
Misa's Father
「...I would be Misa's father.」
Misa-senpai's... father!?
I frantically step away from her.
％Ｂ
「M-My most sincere apologies! I'm, uh, I mean, my name is ％Ａ ％Ｂ! Misa-senpai... I mean, Misa-san and I are, um―」


Misa's Father
「That's enough.」
％Ｂ
「Wha...?」
Misa's Father
「Misa's already told me about you. Let's put aside the formalities for now and do what needs to be done.」

％Ｂ
「Uh...」
He walks up to one of the tanks, flashlight in hand, and places a finger in the water.

Misa's Father
「Hm... We should be fine if we can maintain this water temperature.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, but, the electric fan and pump are both out of battery...」
Misa's Father
「No need to worry. We brought two sets from home.」
He walks back over toward the door and comes back carrying two sets of electric fans and pumps.

Misa's Father
「I'll handle this, so you should rest a bit. Misa, you do the pumps.」

Misa
「I understand!」
all
％Ｂ
「I-I'll help too!」
Misa's Father
「You don't need to force yourself.」
％Ｂ
「I'm fine! I can keep going! Please let me help!」
I grab the other electric fan.
Misa's Father
「Hm... Then please. I'll start from over here, so please start at the other end.」

％Ｂ
「Understood!」
The three of us spend the next hour or so maintaining the water tanks.

And then―
％Ｂ
「Oh...」
The room lights suddenly turn on, along with the tank lights.

Misa's Father
「Looks like the blackout's over.」
％Ｂ
「We did it...」
Misa
「Yes... We did.」
We look at each other, with sweat on our foreheads, smile, and―
％Ｂ
「Phew.」
Misa
「Hahh.」
all
We both immediately sit down, breathing sighs of relief.
％Ｂ
「I am soooo tired!」
Misa
「Thank you very much for your hard work. Thanks to you, the fish are safe.」

all
I look at the tanks.
The fish seem startled at the sudden lights, but they're still all swimming around.

％Ｂ
「Thank god... they're all okay.」
Misa
「There's no telling what may have happened to them if you hadn't stayed behind. Please allow me to thank you in their stead.」


Misa
「Thank you so very much.」
％Ｂ
「It wasn't just me. Things might have really taken a terrible turn if you and your father hadn't shown up...」


％Ｂ
「And I'm sorry for trying to play it off. I should've told you everything right from the start. Because you're my... well, you know...」


Misa
「...」
％Ｂ
「Um... Misa-senpai?」
Misa
「...Zzz...」
all
％Ｂ
「Huh?」
Misa
「...Zzz... Zzz.」
％Ｂ
「Uh, what?」
...She's asleep?
Misa's Father
「It looks like she's finally relaxed.」
％Ｂ
「What?」
Misa's Father
「She's always been this way. She falls asleep out of relief once a tense situation's over.」

％Ｂ
「Oh, really...」
Misa's Father
「Though she almost never does it in front of people who aren't family. It looks like she trusts you quite a lot.」

Misa-senpai trusts me that much...?
...That makes me pretty happy.
％Ｂ
「Uh.. Um...!」
I hurriedly stand up.
％Ｂ
「Um... Please allow me to formally introduce myself. I'm... I am Senpai's... M-Misa-san's junior by one year. My name is ％Ａ ％Ｂ.」


％Ｂ
「Misa-san and I are, um... please forgive my forwardness, but we're da...dating...」

Misa's Father
「Mhm, I've already heard from Misa. Then allow me to introduce myself as well... I'm Misa's father, Okihara Kazuyoshi.」

％Ｂ
「I-I'm pleased to make your acquaintance.」
Misa's Father
「Likewise.」
％Ｂ
「Um... I've, uh, well...」
Misa's Father
「There's no need to be so nervous. You can speak the way you always do.」
％Ｂ
「O-Okay... I've also heard about you from Misa-san. That you were the marine scientist who was the director of Marinpia Shionagi.」


Misa's Father
「Former director. Since Marinpia's closed down now.」
Misa-senpai's father... Okihara-san smiles nostalgically.

Misa's Father
「Though I was quite lacking in aquarium maintenance know-how for a marine scientist back when we first started up Marinpia. I went through nights like tonight all the time.」


％Ｂ
「Did you really?」
Misa's Father
「I lost count of the number of times I stayed the night at the aquarium, like you did today. I slept in front of the tanks when the fish were ill, because I was so worried.」

Misa's Father
「Unfortunately, it seems like my daughter's inherited those eccentricities of mine too...」

He smiles sympathetically at Misa-senpai.
I smile too.
Misa's Father
「I hear you really liked Marinpia.」
％Ｂ
「Y-Yes... I did... Though to be honest, it was more about the building itself than the aquarium...」

Misa's Father
「I've heard that too. You respect Azuma-san, don't you?」

％Ｂ
「Oh, you know Azuma-san, don't you?」
Misa's Father
「Of course I do. We talked on many occasions while we were designing Marinpia.」

Misa's Father
「I'm terribly sorry for what I've done to him. That aquarium could be said to be his most exemplary work, but it closed down because of my shortcomings.」


％Ｂ
「B-But it wasn't your fault that Marinpia closed...」
Misa's Father
「Ah, that's right... You know about that, too. Misa told me about that. That you defended Marinpia's honor.」


Misa's Father
「And I've also heard that you want Misa to reopen Marinpia someday?」

％Ｂ
「Yes... I believe that she can do it.」
Misa's Father
「She seemed very happy about that when she told me about it. And as her father, I'm happy that you think so positively of my daughter as well.」


％Ｂ
「Oh, no...」
Misa's Father
「This may only end up being an excuse... but Marinpia's closure was a foregone conclusion, as a municipal aquarium receiving public financial aid.」


％Ｂ
「Yes... I understand. Azuma-san told me the same thing.」

Misa's Father
「Thinking back on it now, there might have been another way. But at the time, shouldering those constant losses seemed to be the only way to build an aquarium in Shionagi.」


％Ｂ
「I don't think the aquarium itself was a mistake. There are still so many people who say they loved Marinpia.」

Misa's Father
「...You're right... Though that only makes it all the more frustrating.」
％Ｂ
「Oh... I-I'm sorry! I shouldn't be talking so high and mighty when I don't know anything...!」

Misa's Father
「No, it's fine. But I'd like to say just one thing. I haven't given up on Marinpia just yet either.」

％Ｂ
「Huh?」
Misa's Father
「I want to reopen Marinpia one day... I want to create another aquarium here in Shionagi City... I really do.」

Misa's Father
「But I've gotten old. I don't have much more time left in my career.」

Misa's Father
「But even if I can't do it... if Misa inherits those wishes of mine, then nothing would make me happier.」


Misa's Father
「I want to be there to help her for that.」
％Ｂ
「I-I do too! I'd... also like to help Misa-san.」

Misa's Father
「...Thank you. Allow me to say it in Misa's place.」
He smiles at the sleeping Misa-senpai.
Misa
「...Zzz... Zzz...」
Misa's Father
「...Misa always pursues the things she likes as directly as she can. I think it's a wonderful thing.」

Misa's Father
「But there have been times when that's caused her to lose sight of the things around her. It's resulted in terrible failures, and incredible pain.」

Misa's Father
「I'm very happy that now there's someone like you who understands her by her side, for when that happens.」

％Ｂ
「Th-Thank you very much!」
Misa's Father
「Please allow me to say... please take good care of Misa.」
％Ｂ
「Y-Yes, I will, and thank you very much!」
And so ends a strange night.
Misa-senpai's got her eyes closed in front of the fish tanks she loves so much... soundly in dreamland.
