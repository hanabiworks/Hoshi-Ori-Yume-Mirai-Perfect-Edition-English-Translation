Mother
「Yes, that's it. That's good～ I think you've completely mastered our family's taste.」

Rikka
「Have I really? Thank you very much, Mother.」
Mother
「Oh, noooo. You don't have to call me thaaat. You'll make me bluuush.」
％Ｂ
「...But you're the one who made her call you that.」
all
My mom had apparently asked her to call her "Mother" at some point.

Mother
「It's fine, isn't it? I'm currently trembling with joy at having a daughter now.」
Mother
「Though having a son is nice too. I can have you grab things that are up high or carry heavy bags.」

％Ｂ
「I'm just a servant for you, aren't I?」
Though I don't really mind.
Mother
「There are just some things that only another woman could understand. I guess you could say it's like men are a different kind of animal?」

％Ｂ
「I can kinda understand what you're getting at.」
I've heard before that men and women might as well be different species biologically.
％Ｂ
「You still dote on Rikka way too much, Mom.」
She acts way more like a mother to her than to me.
Though it's a good thing that my mother and girlfriend get along.
Mother
「I want you to become part of the family for sure. And I want to see my first grandchild's face too. Make sure they take after you! I'm sure they'll be cute!」

％Ｂ
「Is disparaging your son that fun for you, Mother...?」
Mother
「Rikka-chan! My son may be the way he is, but don't lose your love for him, okay?」

Rikka
「Losing... I'm genuinely very glad I met him. I couldn't imagine dating or, um... marrying anyone else.」

％Ｂ
「Rikka...」
May I cry?
Rikka
「But I currently would like to work toward my dreams... Having a child... as of now at least, isn't really...」

Rikka
「Of course... I would love for that to be the case in the future... and I hope Ryousuke thinks the same.」

Rikka
「Of course... I would love for that to be the case in the future... and I hope you think the same.」

％Ｂ
「I do. I think so too.」
Rikka
「Ryousuke... I'm so happy. Thank you. I apologize for being so selfish, Mother.」

Rikka
「Hehe... I'm so happy. Thank you. I apologize for being so selfish, Mother.」

Mother
「It's okay～ I'm happy just knowing that you're thinking about a future with him.」

Rikka
「I'm still in the process of learning many things, so I hope you can continue to help me do so.」

Mother
「Oh no. Likewise.」
They lower their heads to one another.
all
Mother
「But you know. Maybe not kids, but you could at least submit the marriage registration―」
％Ｂ
「Just stop with that already...」
We leave the house, trying to escape from my mom's schemes to make Rikka her daughter.

％Ｂ
「Sorry she's always like that.」
Rikka
「Hehe. I like having a fun mother-in-law like her.」
％Ｂ
「If you say so. It just feels like you're seeing a really embarrassing part of the family...」

Rikka
「I think she's trying to be considerate in her own way, so I can feel better at ease.」

％Ｂ
「I doubt she's thought that hard about it.」
She's probably just enjoying herself.
Judging by how she was like, "I'm so jealous of you two, you're just like your father and me in the past～" the other day.

％Ｂ
「Anyway, we need to find somewhere to live soon.」
Rikka
「About that... I don't need a piano. I can always go back to play the one at home, and they are pianos at the university too.」

％Ｂ
「But it'd be convenient if you had one at home too, right?」
all
The main thing that's getting in the way of our home search is a piano for Rikka.
A piano needs a decent amount of space, thick walls for soundproofing, and a strong floor.

All of the places that fit that description are really expensive.
Those requirements are something Rikka's parents pointed out to us, along with a wonderful show of support.

The first is that if we're going to take the piano at Rikka's house right now with us, they would foot the bill for moving it.

That was the first time I learned that you need to hire specialty movers to move a piano.

The second is that if we aren't able to find the space for a grand piano, they would provide us with an upright piano.
The third is that they would take on paying the rent for a place that would have enough room for a piano. It was the best offer we could possibly ask for.

Rikka and I talked things over together, and gratefully accepted their aid regarding the piano.

I thought a piano would be indispensable for Rikka, and it was something that I could never be able to accomplish with the meager means currently available to me.

But we politely declined their offer to pay our rent, saying we'd like to be as independent as possible. 

％Ｂ
「...I was naive. I thought we could make do and find a place that had what we needed if we just looked hard enough.」

Rikka
「You're not at fault. I thought the same thing. And besides, you did your best looking.」

％Ｂ
「I wish that had actually produced some results, though.」
％Ｂ
「Hey, Rikka. How about we pick that place the realtor showed us the other day?」

Rikka
「Wha... But that was pretty expensive.」
％Ｂ
「It wouldn't be impossible if I picked up an extra job for when I don't have anything to do at the firm.」

Rikka
「No. I don't want you to overexert yourself over something like this.」
％Ｂ
「This is exactly what I'd wanna be overexerting myself for.」
Rikka
「I'm happy you feel that way. But I want you to understand how I feel too.」
％Ｂ
「Don't you want to play piano?」
Rikka
「I do, but that's not what's important here.」
I know what Rikka's trying to say.
She's trying to prioritize me over having a place with a piano.
But that just makes me feel so weak... and pathetic...
I'm bitter about not being able to provide any part of a satisfying lifestyle for her. I want to do it for her, even if that means a little extra strain on my part.

It's the pointless pride of a man.
Azuma
「What's this? ...Having a lover's quarrel in the middle of the street?」
all
％Ｂ
「Teacher...」
Rikka
「It's very nice to see you again.」
Azuma
「Oh, Rikka-chan, long time no see. Feel free to come over to the firm again whenever you want. A pretty girl really livens the place up.」


Rikka
「Oh... Yes. Thank you very much.」
Azuma
「So? What are you arguing about?」
％Ｂ
「Well...」
Azuma
「I'll save you from your troubles, boy. Here, come with me.」
Azuma
「Living togetheeer～～～!?」
Azuma
「Hahahahahahah! Really jumping into things, aren't you!? No, I think that's great. I love stuff like that.」

Azuma
「And so you've decided to live together, but you need to find a place where you can keep a piano...」

％Ｂ
「...Yes.」
Azuma
「Listen... The price of a property takes lots of things into account, like the year of its construction, the location, floor plan, and facilities.」

Azuma
「Which of course means that if the property's got better stuff, then the price goes up. What's a guy who wants to become an architect doing not being able to see that coming?」

％Ｂ
「I was naive to think we could find something within our budget if we just prioritized the floor plan and facilities, and compromised on the rest. I know I was wrong... I have no words with which to explain myself.」

Azuma
「This area's gotten developed real fast lately, and the number of old buildings around goes down every year. So what, you gonna give up now that you haven't found anything?」


％Ｂ
「No! I'll keep looking!」
Azuma
「Sorry to tell you this, but you're not gonna find the place you're looking for, no matter how much you look. Take it from me, who knows more about how things go around here. Though it's up to you whether or not you believe me.」
％Ｂ
「...Hgh.」
The Azuma Architectural Firm is far and above the most well-known firm in Shionagi.
He's well acquainted with the realtors in the area. He must be telling the truth.

Azuma
「What do you think, Rikka-chan?」

Rikka
「I... don't mind if we don't have a piano. I can always play elsewhere. But there will only ever be one place where I live with him, so...」


Azuma
「You wanna live together with this guy that badly?」
Rikka
「Auh... Y-Yes...」
Azuma
「She really loves you. How about I pitch in and help you out, out of respect for Rikka-chan's love.」

all
％Ｂ
「Wha... But I thought you said there wasn't anywhere nearby...」
Azuma
「That's if you go at it normally through realtors. Who the hell do you think I am?」

all
It's a slightly old apartment in a hilly area, in walking distance from the university. 

％Ｂ
「Is it really okay for us to live in a place this nice for so little?」
The amount we're being asked for is about a fourth of the budget we had agreed on... It's way too cheap.

Landlady
「It's fiiine. You see, I had this room built specifically for my daughter when she told me she wanted to become a pianist. But she quit partway.」
Landlady
「We already got rid of the piano. But I just couldn't bear letting anyone else live here once my daughter got married, because of how much I supported her piano playing.」
Landlady
「You two are working hard to achieve your dreams, aren't you? I think that's wonderful. Good luck with the piano.」
Rikka
「Y-Yes! Thank you very much!」
The landlady grabs Rikka's hand with both hands and whips it up and down.

She seems like a really nice landlady.
％Ｂ
「Thank you very much, Teacher.」
Azuma
「Don't mention it.」
％Ｂ
「But it seems I've just ended up relying on you again...」
Azuma
「Keep this in mind. A person's connections are undeniably one of their assets. You found this place on your own, through your own efforts.」

％Ｂ
「Yes. Then please, allow me to thank you for your help sometime.」

Azuma
「Just listen to you talk, kid. If you've got the time for that, then learn how to do some work. Getting to see that smile of Rikka-chan's is plenty enough reward for me.」


He ruffles my hair.
We're both watching Rikka.
Rikka
「Hehe... Yes. We can discuss that when the time comes.」
She's smiling happily as she talks with the landlady.
Azuma
「She's a good girl. Don't make her cry now.」
％Ｂ
「I know.」
I make a vow. I'm going to keep protecting that smile.
