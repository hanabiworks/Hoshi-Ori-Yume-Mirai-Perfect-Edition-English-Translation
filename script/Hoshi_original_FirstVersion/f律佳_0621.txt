「Aaaaaaaahhhhh, there's no more tiiiime!!」
$$smh_OpenCHK
My morning was fine until after I took a bath.
I used some gel for the first time to try to fix up my hair, but I started freaking out when it stood up like bed hair.
My floor is covered in clothes from when I was ransacking my closet.

And on top of that, I still have no idea what I'm gonna wear.
％Ｂ
「I know... I know it isn't a date!」
But I'm still going out somewhere with a girl today.
And she's someone I'm interested in. This is even higher stakes than a date.
But I'll be late if I keep this up forever.
％Ｂ
「But what if she thinks I look lame...?」
％Ｂ
「What am I supposed to doooo!?」
...I casually glance at my phone.
It's only been a minute since the last time I looked.

There's still about thirty minutes until we're supposed to meet up.
％Ｂ
「...I'm starting to get nervous. Is this really okay...?」
I'm looking at myself in a store window in the marketplace. I'm wearing totally normal clothes, no different than usual.

Picking out cool-ish clothes or messing with my hair only made it all the more apparent that I put a bit too much thought into things.

So I washed out the hair gel, used a comb and hair dryer, and picked out clothes that were just clean.

Either way, I don't have the time to go home and change now.
I've done the best I can for now.
If it doesn't work out, I'll make use of the experience for next time.
Thinking about it that way gets me a little more relaxed.
I look at the time on my phone.
...It's only been a minute since the last time.
It's a little before our meet-up time.
_00cutinBS
I can see someone tall and pretty walking toward me, her black hair fluttering behind her.

It's like a scene out of a movie.
She spots me, and starts heading straight this way.
_00cutinBS
Seeing men turn around to watch her pass by serves to remind me of just how pretty Narusawa is.

But she herself isn't paying any mind to the attention at all.
She's probably used to it.
She comes to a stop before me.
％Ｂ
「Morning, Narusawa.」
Rikka
「Good morning. I'm sorry, did you wait long?」
％Ｂ
「No, I just got here a bit too early.」
Narusawa's not particularly dressed up, but she's still elegant and pretty.

Which makes sense... Since from her perspective, we're just going shopping together.
I'm a little disappointed, but I'm also glad that I ended up not dressing up too much myself.

％Ｂ
「By the way, what do you think of my clothes today?」
Rikka
「Yours? Let's see... Hmm～ ...They're normal?」
％Ｂ
「Normal, huh.」
Thank god... Passing marks, at least.
Rikka
「But they have a nice, clean look to them. I think they look very good on you.」
She smiles gently.
Rikka
「Let's go. The music store's this way.」
all
Her long black hair curves behind her as she turns to face the street.

I can smell the barest hint of citrus.
It's a gentle, reassuring fragrance.
It smells a bit different from shampoo...
It's coming from around behind her ear... maybe?
Is it perfume?
Rikka
「What's wrong? Aren't you coming?」
％Ｂ
「Oh! My bad. Let's go.」
...Did she do just a little bit extra to prepare for our outing today?
Nothing would make me happier if she did.
％Ｂ
「Wow... So this is what music stores are like.」
It's a calming place, unlike CD shops.
I see stringed instruments like violins, trumpets and other brass instruments, saxophones among the woodwinds, a piano on display...

They all look expensive, and looking at the price tags, they actually are.
There are even what look like unidentifiable components of other instruments. I'm totally lost.

Rikka
「Is this your first time in one?」
％Ｂ
「Wha, how'd you know?」
Rikka
「Hehe. You've been looking around the store this whole time. It's obvious it's your first time.」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, this is pretty nerve-racking for a first-timer.」
Rikka
「Let's just get what we came here for and leave, then.」
％Ｂ
「No, I can just look around and wait if there's other stuff you wanna look at.」

Rikka
「There's nothing I want in particular at the moment. The sheet music is in the shelves in the back. They're arranged by composer.」

％Ｂ
「So who composed "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star"...?」
Rikka
「Mozart. Although it was originally a chanson written by Jean-Philippe Rameau.」

So it was Wolfgang...
That was only a short while ago, but the name seems so nostalgic to me.
Maybe that speaks to how rich my time with Narusawa feels.
all
We look through the staggering array of sheet music for the piece.
％Ｂ
「Mozart... Mozart... Oh, here he is.」
％Ｂ
「"Good night, you're quite an ox"? Hm... Uh... Wha, "Lick my butt"!?」

Rikka
「What's wrong?」
％Ｂ
「Mozart was a hell of a sadist, wasn't he... Or maybe it's the other way around?」
Either way, he was a total freak!
％Ｂ
「You know... I always thought historically famous musicians were all really noble, refined people, but I think I've really started to see them as fellow human beings today.」

Rikka
「Just so you know, "Lick my b..." isn't what you think it's about.」

％Ｂ
「Sorry, didn't catch that just now. Lick what?」
Rikka
「Lick... my... bu...bu... auuuh...」
％Ｂ
「...」
Rikka
「...Leck mich im Arsch.」


She used some words I don't know. It isn't even the slightest bit erotic.
Rikka
「You're just like Mozart, aren't you?」
％Ｂ
「Hm? Hmmh～ ...I assume you meant that as an insult?」
Rikka
「I'm surprised you understood. He was a womanizing alcoholic who loved toilet humor and was always neck-deep in debt.」
％Ｂ
「I haven't done anything that bad, have I!?」
Rikka
「You've done enough to have that piece from just now sung into your ear as a canon for six voices.」

all
Narusawa takes some sheet music titled "Ah vous dirais-je, Maman" to the register.



％Ｂ
「Thiiiiiss～～ ...iiiiiisss～～ ...heaaavyyyyy～～」

％Ｂ
「Fnnhhhhhhhhh!!!」
I will myself to move my legs.
I'm carrying tons of heavy stuff. Rice, milk, detergent, the works.

Is this Narusawa getting back at me for what I did earlier?

If it is, then I just have to suck it up and take it...
I was already expecting something like this anyway, since the whole point of me coming along was to hold her stuff...
％Ｂ
「Fnh, fnh, fnnnhhhhhhhhh!!」
％Ｂ
「Hahh, hahh... Fnnhh! Fnnhhhhhhhhhh...」
Rikka
「...Are you okay? Maybe I should hold some?」
She looks worried. Maybe even she's realized she's made me hold a lot.
％Ｂ
「No... I can handle this. I came here to hold your stuff, so what kinda loser would I be if I had you hold it partway through...!!」

Rikka
「I see. We're almost to my house, so do your best.」
％Ｂ
「Right! ...Hm? Uh... Wait, what?」
What'd she say just now?
Did she just cheer me on?
Narusawa just cheered me on?
％Ｂ
「All riiiiiight! I'm getting puuuuuuuuuumped!!」
％Ｂ
「I think I could go right past your place and carry this all the way to the other side of Shionagi now!」

Rikka
「Sigh... What would be the point of going that far?」
％Ｂ
「We're, heeeeeeeeeeeeeeere～～～」
We've finally made it to Narusawa's place.
I'm covered in sweat. I wanna take a bath right this very second.
Rikka
「Thank you very much.」
％Ｂ
「I'll put the bags here.」
I can't bring myself to just walk into a girl's house like that.
Rikka
「Wait... I'll make some cold tea, so come on in.」
％Ｂ
「You sure? ...Wait, is this another test?」
Rikka
「This time... I'm serious.」
％Ｂ
「Please excuse me, then.」
Rikka
「Could you put the bags next to the kitchen?」
％Ｂ
「Sure thing. Here, right?」
all
I finally rid myself of the crushing weight of the bags.
Rikka
「Here. Use this to wipe your sweat.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, thanks!」
I accept the pure-white towel.
I press it against my face. I feel a fluffy softness, and smell a flowery fragrance.

Rikka
「You can relax on the couch over there. I have coffee, black tea, apple juice, and barley tea. Which do you want?」


％Ｂ
「Black tea sounds nice. Cold, if possible.」
Rikka
「Do you want it straight? Or do you want something in it? I have lemon slices and milk.」

％Ｂ
「Lemon, then, please.」
all
Whompfh...
％Ｂ
「...Hm.」
I sink myself into the living room couch.
So Narusawa usually sits here.
Of course she does. She lives here.
It's an obvious fact, but... I'm nervous.
This is the second time I've been here, but it's the first time it's been just the two of us.

Maybe something special might happen now that no one else is here... Hey, you can't blame me for imagining, right?

The nice, sweet, citrusy scent makes it patently obvious that a girl lives here in this space.

％Ｂ
「Hey, Narusawa. I've been wondering. What's this orange smell from?」

I call out to her as she readies the tea in the kitchen.
Rikka
「It's a room freshener. I like citrus smells, so I use something similar for my perfume too. I can turn it off and ventilate the room if you don't like it...」
％Ｂ
「It's fine. It's a nice smell.」
Rikka
「...You're kind of a freak.」
％Ｂ
「Why!? I just said it smells nice!」
Rikka
「Sharing your opinion on how a girl's room smells is something a freak would do. Sigh... It looks like you've been smelling me.」

She sighs jokingly and walks over.
I can tell from her tone that she wasn't serious, so I decide not to continue trying to explain myself.
Being able to talk this casually's a huge step forward from the way we were when we first met.

Rikka
「Here you go.」
She sets down a tray with two refreshing-looking glasses of iced tea and two sweet-smelling muffins.

She places one set in front of me and sits down across from me.
％Ｂ
「Oh, this looks delicious!」
Rikka
「I hope you find it to your tastes. It's my first time having someone that isn't family eat them.」

％Ｂ
「What? You baked these!?」
She seems a little embarrassed.
Rikka
「Yes, I did. But these are just something I make on weekends or when I have the time. It's not really what I'd call a hobby.」

％Ｂ
「It's still amazing! I thought you bought these from a store or something!」

％Ｂ
「I didn't even know you could make muffins that quickly. Not that I know that much about baking, though.」

Rikka
「Oh... W-Well...」
Her expression tells me she didn't want me to point that out.
She bashfully averts her eyes...
And her gaze eventually settles on the muffins.
Rikka
「...I made these this morning before I left.」
Rikka
「I knew you'd be coming along to help with my shopping, and I thought it'd be hot today, so you could rest here... So I made these beforehand...」


％Ｂ
「...」
So that means she made these for me? ...That's how I can think of this, right?

How do I express how I'm feeling right now?
％Ｂ
「Haha...」
Rikka
「Ghh... What's so funny?」
％Ｂ
「No, I'm just so happy. I'll dig in!! Agh, hagh... Ohh, this muffin's great!」

％Ｂ
「Gulp, gulp... This lemon tea's great too. It's just a bit sour, and it makes the muffin taste even sweeter!」

％Ｂ
「This muffin tastes so smooth! I could eat these all day!」

Rikka
「Hehe. You don't have to eat it so frantically. And there are more if you want them.」
Rikka
「Oh... Look, you're spilling because you're rushing.」
％Ｂ
「Oh, sorry... It's just so good.」
The table's covered in muffin crumbs.
I'm not usually this messy an eater. This might've been a bit ill-mannered of me...

％Ｂ
「Could I get something to wipe the table with?」
Rikka
「It's fine. I'll do it.」
She grabs a rag from the kitchen and swiftly clears the table.
Rikka
「Pff... Hehehe... Ahaha!」
And then she starts laughing when she sees my face.
％Ｂ
「Wh-What?」
Rikka
「You even have crumbs around your mouth.」
％Ｂ
「Wha? Wh-Where? Here? ...Did I get it?」
Rikka
「You didn't. Here, stay still.」
She extends her fingers toward the other side of my mouth.
I feel her lightly touch my skin, then pull away.
She gives another small, happy smile.
Rikka
「There, I got it. Eat more calmly this time, okay?」
％Ｂ
「Sorry about that.」
Rikka
「No, it's okay... It showed me that you really liked it. It made me happy.」

％Ｂ
「O-Oh really... I-I'll have some more...」
I start eating, slower this time, to try to cover up the embarrassment and indescribable ticklishness I'm feeling.

Narusawa smiles warmly as she watches me, her cheeks tinged just slightly pink.

It's kinda really hard to eat when she's watching me like that...
％Ｂ
「Uh, mh... Aren't you gonna eat?」
Rikka
「I will.」
But she doesn't reach out toward her fork or anything.
Her gaze is locked onto me as I eat.

％Ｂ
「Um... Am I still eating messily?」
Rikka
「No, you're not.」
％Ｂ
「Well uh, I was just wondering, 'cause you've been staring at me.」

Rikka
「...Huh? Oh, I-I'm sorry! That must have made it hard to eat... It's just... I was happy, so...」

％Ｂ
「You were happy?」
Rikka
「I was so happy that you were enjoying what I made... I didn't even realize I was staring.」

％Ｂ
「...It really is delicious.」
What? I couldn't say anything better than that?
But my mind's blank. The girl I'm interested in is making a face like that, right before my eyes.

I'm not nearly composed enough to be able to try to look good for her.

I'm just that attracted to this girl named Narusawa.
Rikka
「Hey... Your face is red. It must be because of the heat. Should I turn on the air conditioning?」

％Ｂ
「Oh, mm... I'm fine. The iced tea's cold enough for me.」
Rikka
「Is it? Let me know if you want more. I'll get you some.」
％Ｂ
「Thanks.」
...There's no mistake. This is love.
Now that I've realized it, I feel refreshed. I calm down...
But my heart's really loud in contrast.
all
And after that, Narusawa just kept staring at my face... 
And my body temperature just kept on going up...
Rikka
「Thank you for today.」
％Ｂ
「I should say the same. The muffins and tea were delicious.」
Rikka
「...」
％Ｂ
「...」
Rikka
「I'll see you again... on Monday.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah... See you on Monday. Later, Narusawa.」
％Ｂ
「...」
By the time I leave Narusawa's place, my brain's already been cooked to well done.




...I wonder if ％Ａ-kun's walked away by now.
I lean against the door and let myself relax.
It's been a long time since I've had such a wonderful teatime.
My heart's hammering against my chest. I can't stop it.
I might have said lots of strange things...
And that must all be because it was ％Ａ-kun who was here...
Rikka
「Monday... It seems so far away.」
He's going to catch fish with Okihara-senpai and the others tomorrow.
I have to play the piano for the BGM for the Tanabata Festival display.
...But that might be a good thing.
I don't know if I'd be able to face him properly tomorrow...
Rikka
「I want it to be Monday already... but I also don't...」
Rikka
「...No, I do. Uuuhh... Geez... My heart's so loud.」
It sounds as if it wants to passionately play a piano piece of its own.
It's beating out a comfortable rhythm.
But for now, I just want the time I need to calm my uplifted emotions down.
