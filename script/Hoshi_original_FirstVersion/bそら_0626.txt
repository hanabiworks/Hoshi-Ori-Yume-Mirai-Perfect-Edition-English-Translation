The next day.
$$smh_OpenCHK
Now that I'm completely recovered, it's time to go to school.
％Ｂ
「...Yooo.」
％Ｂ
「Wagh!?」
Natsuki
「Congrats on getting better!」
％Ｂ
「Segawa... You shouldn't blind people with camera flashes out of nowhere when they're just getting over being sick.」

Natsuki
「Just getting over, my butt. You had lots of fun yesterday～ Was it delicious?」


％Ｂ
「Don't say it like that...」
Natsuki
「Oh, it wasn't? She made you food, didn't she?」

％Ｂ
「...Yeah, it was delicious.」
Natsuki
「See? You did have fun.」
％Ｂ
「No, it's more like the way you said it...」

Natsuki
「Oh, Rikka. Mooorning.」
Rikka
「Good morning.」
％Ｂ
「Yo, Narusawa.」
all
Rikka
「Oh... You're here today?」
％Ｂ
「I am. I'm feeling all better now thanks to all of you.」
Rikka
「I didn't do anything. Though I was a little worried.」

％Ｂ
「Really. Sorry to make you worry.」
Rikka
「...You don't have to get that formal. Anyway, Segawa-san and the others went to your house yesterday, didn't they?」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, Segawa and Shinozaki did.」
Rikka
「What about Ousaka-san? She was with them too, wasn't she?」
％Ｂ
「...So you knew.」
Natsuki
「Of course she knew. Rikka's the one who recommended for Sora to come over.」


％Ｂ
「Wha... Really? I thought you said you kidnapped her...?」
Rikka
「She looked very worried for you when she came to our classroom, so I just said that she should go see you in person if she was that worried.」


Natsuki
「But she was hesitating, and that's where I came in and kidnapped her!」

％Ｂ
「...So you did force her to come along, then...」

Natsuki
「It's fine. It's not like she was against it herself anyway. And you got to have yourself quite the tasty meal yesterday because of it!」


％Ｂ
「I told you not to say it like that!」
Rikka
「...How obscene.」
％Ｂ
「Come on, Narusawa, stop it! She just made me food!」

Why do I have to make excuses for myself like this as soon as I'm back after two days of absence...?

all
％Ｂ
「Oh, right. Hey, Segawa.」
Natsuki
「Hm? What is iiit?」
％Ｂ
「Sorry about this, but could you show me your notes for class from while I was out?」

％Ｂ
「Shuuichi told me exams are coming up soon. It'd be great if you could tell me what I should know for the exams too.」


Natsuki
「...You see, I think photos are something like a bridge linking the past to the present, and the present to the future.」

％Ｂ
「...? Yeah, I remember you saying that was your personal belief. So those notes.」
Natsuki
「Which means that I stick by my principles, and don't record the past through any means but photos...」
％Ｂ
「...So what you're saying... is that you don't take notes...」
Natsuki
「N-No, I do? It's just that I happened to not take notes for just these last two days?」

％Ｂ
「...As if coincidences like that happen. So then how are you going to do on exams?」

Natsuki
「I'm perfectly ready! ...Probably.」
Well, I guess I don't have the time to be worrying about others.
％Ｂ
「All right. I'll just ask Narusawa, then.」
all
I didn't really wanna ask her, since I felt like she'd be kind of strict about stuff like this...

％Ｂ
「Uhh... Narusawa, mind if I ask you something?」
Rikka
「...This is about my notes, isn't it?」
％Ｂ
「Oh... You already know?」
Rikka
「Segawa-san's very loud, after all. It's fine, I can lend you mine.」

％Ｂ
「Wha, really?」
Rikka
「...I wouldn't give them to people who don't usually take them, but you had no choice. There are a few subjects I haven't brought today, so can I give you those tomorrow?」


％Ｂ
「That'd be great. I owe you one.」
Natsuki
「Thanks so much, Rikka.」
％Ｂ
「Segawa... You're kidding...」
Natsuki
「You know how I've been supporting the naturalist club with you, as a member of the grad-alb committee? I just don't have the time to study. I didn't have a choice, so it's okay, right? Please?」


Rikka
「Sigh... Do whatever you want.」
Natsuki
「Lucky me! Thanks, Rikka! I'll make sure you're 30 percent prettier in the photos for the grad-alb!」

She says something random and starts copying Narusawa's notes with me.

all
Narusawa's notes are really easy to understand.
Her handwriting's neat, and she always writes the important parts with colored ink.

％Ｂ
「Wow, Narusawa. You must have great grades with notes like these.」

Natsuki
「Which means we'll be perfectly prepared because we're wholesale copying these notes!」

％Ｂ
「...That's a pretty interesting way of looking at it.」
I guess you could call her an optimist.
Natsuki
「Oh... By the way, are you and Sora dating already?」
％Ｂ
「No, I'm still waiting for a response─」
％Ｂ
「...」
％Ｂ
「Wait a second. Why do you know about that?」
Natsuki
「Excuuuuuuuse me!? What, did you think I didn't know about how you feel? That's the real surprise here!」

％Ｂ
「Well... Uh...」
Natsuki
「You really think no one would notice when you've been paying that much attention to her!?」

％Ｂ
「S-Segawa!? Shhh! P-Please, let's speak a little more quietly...」

Natsuki
「Your feelings have been obvious for a while now! To me, at the very least.」

％Ｂ
「I-I apologize for underestimating you...」
Really...
Yeah, I guess it did seem like Segawa noticed a while ago...
Natsuki
「I guess you've already confessed to her, if you're waiting for a response.」
％Ｂ
「Mm... Yeah.」
Natsuki
「But it doesn't look like you've been rejected right away like every other boy up until now, so it's all up to what you do from now on.」


％Ｂ
「Yeah, pretty much.」
Natsuki
「Good luck, I guess. I'll help out as much as I can too.」

％Ｂ
「R-Right... Thanks...」
...Is Segawa supporting me?
Man, she's such a nice person...
Natsuki
「Boys who have girlfriends smile more, so they come out better in photos～」

...Hmm... Kinda hard to thank her sincerely after hearing that...
But still. Thanks, Segawa.
all
I go to the astronomy clubroom to pick up the telescope and bring it up to the roof.
Ousaka walks quietly beside me.
Mhm. This feels best to me.
％Ｂ
「Thanks for coming over to make food yesterday. I'm feeling completely better now, thanks to you.」

Sora
「...Are you really okay?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. I was fine already when you came yesterday, wasn't I? I'm okay now.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「The weather's nice today. Looks like we'll be able to stargaze properly.」
Sora
「...」
all
％Ｂ
「...Huh?」
Ousaka's not next to me anymore.
I start frantically looking around when the telescope suddenly becomes lighter in my arms.

I look to see Ousaka holding the end of the tripod.
Sora
「...I'll hold it with you.」
％Ｂ
「...Okay.」
A few days ago I probably would've told her she didn't have to do that.
But now this little bit of kindness from her makes me happy.

I'm always happy when I'm with Ousaka, no matter what we do.
％Ｂ
「...Hey... Do you think aliens exist?」
Sora
「...Why so suddenly?」
％Ｂ
「Well I just wanted to ask. You like astronomy, so I was wondering what you thought about aliens.」

Sora
「...I can't say they exist, since there aren't any actual sightings.」
％Ｂ
「Sounds like you wanna say they do, though.」
Sora
「...There are infinite possibilities in space. It's hard to prove they don't exist.」
％Ｂ
「I see.」
Sora
「...What do you think
, Ryou

?」
％Ｂ
「Well... They might not be out there, but I think it'd be interesting if they were. Don't you think it sounds like an adventure?」

Sora
「...There are stars that are like people.」
％Ｂ
「Huh? What do you mean? Like constellations like Orion?」
Sora
「...No. Stars that are compared to people. Vega and Altair.」
％Ｂ
「Ohh... Orihime and Hikoboshi. I get it, yeah, they are kinda like people.」
Sora
「...You could call them aliens.」
％Ｂ
「Haha, I guess so.」
We make casual conversation.
Spending time like this makes me happy too.
It's like Ousaka said. It's recently become natural for the two of us to be together.

That's why Ousaka felt lonely after not seeing me for just one day. And I feel the same way.

I know I want to be with Ousaka more.
I want to be with her from now on...
Those feelings have grown a lot stronger than before.
all
Sora
「...It's almost time to go. We'll put away the telescope.」
％Ｂ
「Hey... Ousaka. I wanna make a request... Couldn't you participate in the Tanabata Festival, as the astronomy club?」

Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「I'm in the event committee still... If the astronomy club doesn't participate in the Tanabata Festival, then I'll have to go help other clubs.」

Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「I'll come here when I have time, of course. But we might not get to be together all the time like we do now.」


Sora
「...Really...」
％Ｂ
「But... I don't wanna spend less time with you. I like being with you like this.」

Sora
「...I also don't dislike being with you
, Ryou

... But I'm the only member of the astronomy club. I won't be able to do anything much even if I do participate.」


％Ｂ
「You have me! I'll support you! I'd help you even if I weren't in the event committee!」

Sora
「...Oh...」
％Ｂ
「I know I might just be acting selfish, but I wanna do something with you. I want to create something in our lives at school. I want to make my time with you into precious memories.」


Sora
「...」
％Ｂ
「Could you participate in the Tanabata Festival with me...?」
Sora
「...」
She falls silent.
...Maybe it's no good after all.
I wasn't intending on rushing her, but I couldn't help but ask her after seeing her today.

But if Ousaka's still not interested, then I'll give up on getting the astronomy club to participate, and find the time to come up to the rooftop while I'm helping the other─

Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「Wha...?」
Did she... nod just now...?
％Ｂ
「Uh, Ousaka... Was that...?」
Sora
「...I'll participate.」
％Ｂ
「Re...Really!?」
Sora
「...I feel like I'll be able to do something if it's with you
, Ryou

. So... I'll participate in the Tanabata Festival.」

％Ｂ
「Re...Really... You'll participate!」
Sora
「...*nod*」
I'm struck by the urge to hug her, but I hold myself back. I hold out my hand to her for a handshake.

％Ｂ
「Then... Let's do some good work together.」
Sora
「...Let's.」
