Shuuichi
「I've got a favor to ask of you.」
Shuuichi
「I want you to distribute these to all classes.」
Shuuichi hands me a stack of tanzaku.
They're for the Tanabata Festival, of course.
％Ｂ
「Wow, this is a lot.」
The tanzaku are arranged into a stack for each class, but there's definitely way more than necessary.

Shuuichi
「Two people should be enough, right?」

Marika
「Mhm. Easy-peasy!」
Shinozaki and I have been assigned to distribute the tanzaku.
Marika
「There's a lot, but it's not like it's too much for us to carry.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, we're fine on that front. I was just thinking it seemed like a lot if we were gonna give one to each person.」

Shuuichi
「Not everyone's going to have just one wish, right?」
Shuuichi
「And it'll look better on the bamboo if we have tons of tanzaku, right?」

％Ｂ
「...I get it now. You've got a point.」
all
Shuuichi
「I'll let you handle it, then. And you should write in a bunch of wishes while you're at it too. Go wish for a girlfriend or something.」


％Ｂ
「Oh, shut up already.」
He's just so smug about having an older girlfriend.
Sucks that I don't have an actual comeback, though.
Marika
「...Do you want a girlfriend?」
％Ｂ
「Huh? Nah... That was just Shuuichi messing around.」
Marika
「Oh, r-right! That's right! L-Let's hurry and pass them out, then! Hurry hurry!」

She's weirdly frantic.
all
Marika
「That was over quicker than expected.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, pretty easy.」
We spent lunch break and some time after school to distribute the tanzaku to all of the classes. We're taking a bit of a break before going back to the committee room.

Marika
「We have a few left over.」
％Ｂ
「That's perfect. We should write some wishes too.」

Marika
「Oh, you're right. I wonder what I should write～」
Despite her saying that, she's already writing.
She's done in a flash.
％Ｂ
「That was quick. What'd you write?」
all
I peer at her tanzaku.
"I wish to see pretty stars on Tanabata," it says.

Marika
「It'd be a shame if it rained on Tanabata, after all.」
％Ｂ
「...Is that all? We've still got some tanzaku left over, you know.」
Marika
「No, this is enough for me.」
％Ｂ
「You don't want much, huh? You gotta write stuff like, "I wish I could be rich," you know?」


％Ｂ
「You know, like how you wrote all that stuff back when we were kids.」
Marika
「Ahaha, did I do that～? ...Now that you mention it, I feel like I did write a lot. But this is enough this year... I think.」


Her eyes are shining.
％Ｂ
「Really... You really don't want anything, do you?」
Marika
「That's not true. I'm actually pretty greedy.」

％Ｂ
「That so? Doesn't seem that way.」
If this is considered greedy, then all humans must be greedy too.
all
...But if Shinozaki's only got one wish, then I really hope it comes true.
