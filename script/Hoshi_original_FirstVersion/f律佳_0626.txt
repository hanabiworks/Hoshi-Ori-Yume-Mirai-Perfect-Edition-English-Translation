The seat next to me is empty once again today.
But I'm not too worried.
Natsuki
「Rikka's apparently not coming to school again today. Are you going to go visit her?」
％Ｂ
「Nah. She's apparently recovered enough to be able to move.」
Natsuki
「Where'd you get that info?」
％Ｂ
「From Narusawa herself.」
Natsuki
「Oh my. Just when did you two become close enough to contact each other about things like that? I wonder what happened when you went to visit her yesterday～」

％Ｂ
「You're in contact with her too, aren't you?」
Natsuki
「That's because I'm a fellow woman. It's completely different.」
all
I got a message from Narusawa this morning saying that she could cook for herself today.

Of course, it might just be that she's too embarrassed to have me come check up on her again now that I know that it's because of her period.

She also apologized for not being able to do our music lessons, to which I responded that she didn't need to worry about it.
％Ｂ
「I took off from committee work yesterday, so I'll make it up with my work today.」

Natsuki
「Oh my, well aren't you motivated. Rikka seems like she's been enjoying herself recently. It must be because of you.」

％Ｂ
「Huh?」
Natsuki
「Just think about it. When you first transferred in, Rikka always came into class right before the bell, and she'd always just listen to music or go off somewhere on her own during breaks, right?」

％Ｂ
「Yeah... Now that you mention it.」
Natsuki
「But now she stays in the classroom a lot, and she talks a lot more. It's a good thing.」

％Ｂ
「I think so too.」
Natsuki
「I think Rikka appreciates you too. Maybe she's in love with you.」

％Ｂ
「Wha, seriously?」
Natsuki
「Look at you smiling like that～」
％Ｂ
「Gh, you're making fun of me!?」
Natsuki
「Ahaha, who knows! Time to get ready for class!」
all
She laughs happily and runs back to her desk.
％Ｂ
「...Honestly.」
I start preparing for our first class too.
Someone different came to visit me today.

Natsuki
「Disappointed that it's me?」
Rikka
「...Whatever could that mean?」
Natsuki
「Don't play dumb～ C'mon now～ Hey, so how was it when Hino came over yesterday?」

Natsuki
「Don't play dumb～ C'mon now～ Hey, so how was it when he came over yesterday?」

Rikka
「Wh-What do you mean, how was it? Nothing really happened.」
I can't stop myself from looking at the fruits on the table as I say so.

The leftovers of the fruits that Hino-kun bought for me yesterday are in my usual basket, letting off a sweet fragrance.

The leftovers of the fruits that ％Ａ-kun bought for me yesterday are in my usual basket, letting off a sweet fragrance.

The smell brings our interactions from yesterday back to mind.
Natsuki
「Hmmh, your face is awfully red for nothing happening... Are you suuure something didn't happen?」

Rikka
「...It's because he found out about my period.」
Natsuki
「Huuuh, hmmmh, is that sooo.」
She speaks in monotone.
Natsuki
「I always thought you were calm and composed, but you're actually pretty fun to tease... It's fun to mess with you, I guess.」

Rikka
「...What are you saying?」
Natsuki
「Nooothing. I like the current you. I can understand why he feels the way he does.」

Natsuki
「Well, Rikka? Did you fall in love with him?」
Rikka
「We're back to talking about this...」
Natsuki
「Isn't it fun to talk about stuff like this, as girl talk? It's kinda like a pajama party.」

Rikka
「I'm just infuriated at being teased.」
Or at least I should be...
But there's also a part of me that enjoys talking to Segawa-san about him.
Natsuki
「You should be a little more sugary for him. I bet he'd be happy.」
Rikka
「I won't.」
Natsuki
「Is that so? I think a girl like you would get all completely sugary sweet once you got in a relationship.」

Rikka
「Is... that what you think?」
Natsuki
「Oh, how rare. You're not denying it?」
Rikka
「...Because I don't quite know myself.」
I would've denied it right away before, but now I don't know.
Just thinking about Hino-kun, even when he's not around...
Just thinking about ％Ａ-kun, even when he's not around...
Rikka
「...Gh, uuuh～」
It squeezes my chest so tight, so sweetly...
My heart starts beating out a pleasant rhythm...
And a part of me deep down goes hot.
Natsuki
「Oh my, you're really in it deep too... You two should just get together already.」
Rikka
「What?」
Natsuki
「I know! I brought snacks～ There's cup cheesecake too. Want some?」

Rikka
「I'll have some.」
Rikka
「"Don't worry about it. Let's continue where we left off once you're back at school."」
Rikka
「"The stuff we learned today in classical lit's apparently gonna be on the exam for sure. I made sure to take good notes, so I'll lend you them later."」
I'm lying belly down on the sofa, reading my messages from ％Ａ-kun to myself.
My phone's filled with messages from him.
It hardly ever made any sounds until just a month ago.
My contacts list only ever had my family members, but now it's up to the double digits.

And it's all because I met him.
Rikka
「"Out at the home goods store getting supplies for the Tanabata Festival. Okihara-senpai won't step away from the pet corner's tropical fish, and I kinda dunno what to do."」

He's attached a cute stamp of a bear with a pained smile.
I rub my face against a cushion.
Rikka
「...I didn't know. I'm a jealous person.」
I'm happy to get messages from ％Ａ-kun.
I can tell that he's trying to entertain me.
But... I can't stop myself from feeling these vague, cloudy emotions when I see another girl's name in his messages.

Rikka
「Okihara-senpai... I'm sorry. That's the second time I've been jealous of you now... It's so unseemly.」

The first time was when we went to collect fish.
The same feelings welled up in my chest when Segawa-san teased him about going with Okihara-san.

Now that I think about it, that might've been the beginning of me being attracted to him...
Rikka
「...Because just thinking about 
Hino-kun 
him 
makes my chest pound and go crazy, and I don't know what to do with myself...」
Rikka
「Is... something wrong with me...?」
My heartbeat quickens.
I hold my phone tight to my chest, pressing it against my heart.
