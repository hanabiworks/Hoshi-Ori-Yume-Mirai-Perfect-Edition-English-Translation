We all meet up in front of the school gates like planned.
％Ｂ
「Uhh... Okay, so we're going to go get cardboard now... but the truth is, Sora and I decided on a part-time job and we have our interview...」

％Ｂ
「It's at 11, so we're sorry about this, but we're going to have to leave the cardboard to you guys.」


Shuuichi
「It's fine, we can handle it. We'll just go through the list of stores you sent us yesterday. You better pass that interview to make up for it, all right?」


％Ｂ
「Yeah, we'll do our best.」
all
Marika
「By the way, what job are you two interviewing for?」
％Ｂ
「Well, it's...」
I glance at Sora.
Sora
「...Similar to customer service.」
Marika
「Similar to...?」
％Ｂ
「I don't really get it either, but that's apparently how it is. Anyway, I'll ask them a bunch of stuff at the interview. The numbers for the job seem pretty good, at least.」


all
Shuuichi
「Okay, then we'll split up to gather up cardboard. There's no point in us all going to the same places at the same time, so let's split up into three groups.」


Natsuki
「How are we deciding groups?」
Shuuichi
「Rock paper scissors should be fine. Everyone who puts out the same hand'll be in a group. Ready? Rock, paper―」

all
Marika
「We're in a group together, Okihara-san.」
Misa
「I look forward to working with you, Marika-san. Ufufu.」
all
Natsuki
「And I'm with Rikka. Oh, it's the classmate team! I think this might be the ultimate team!」

Rikka
「The ultimate... What does that even mean...?」
all
Shuuichi
「So I guess I'm with Yukimura.」
Touko
「I'll handle the negotiating, so Four-Eyes-kun can carry everything.」

Shuuichi
「Sure thing, leave it to me! No, wait a second! I'm holding everything?」

Touko
「I can't carry heavy things, since I'm fragile. You know how heavy cardboard is. Anyway, I'll be counting on you～」


Shuuichi
「Really, then I guess I'll have to... Wait, what? You're fragile...? I could've sworn...」

We all go to the marketplace together.
We split up here.
％Ｂ
「All right, we'll head to the interview. We'll go back to school once we're done, so let's meet back up there.」

Shuuichi
「Got it. See you at school, then.」
Marika
「Good luck on your interview～」
all
Shuuichi and the others head out to get the cardboard.
And we head to our interview.
％Ｂ
「Let's go, Sora.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
％Ｂ
「Hey, so is the customer service stuff gonna be at some store here?」
Sora
「...Probably.」
％Ｂ
「Probably? ...Wait a second, you don't know the details either?」
Sora
「...*nod*」
You're kidding...
％Ｂ
「How'd you find out about this job?」
Sora
「...Tanaka-san.」
％Ｂ
「Wha? Tanaka-san?」
Sora
「...My next-door neighbor. He works for the local chamber of commerce. I told my mom I was looking for a job, and she apparently told him about it. And he gave me this flyer.」


She pulls a folded sheet of paper out from her pocket.

all
％Ｂ
「That's the flyer?」
It's a flyer for a summer event at the Shionagi marketplace.
There's artwork of mascot characters as well as a description of summer-break-only stamp rallies and daily events in the marketplace.


The back side reads, "Recruiting friends to help!" along with a listing of the wages and details Sora already told me last night.

％Ｂ
「Yeah, you're right... It says, "Job description: Similar to customer service."」

Sora definitely wasn't lying.
Sora
「...Tanaka-san's already put in a good word. It's an interview, but it's mostly just a meeting. We've already passed.」


％Ｂ
「Oh, really.」
I was a little nervous about the interview.
％Ｂ
「So judging by the flyer, I guess it's going to be something along the lines of helping out with the stamp rally and stuff?」

Sora
「...Probably.」
I guess we'll just have to find out once we're there.
We walk into the office of the chamber of commerce and tell them we're here for an interview. They tell us to wait for the person in charge to come.

％Ｂ
「Looks like we're the only ones interviewing here today.」
Sora
「...*nod*」
I wonder if there's anyone else who applied.
I doubt we're the only ones...
all
Staff
「I apologize for the wait. Let's see, are you the two whom Tanaka-san referred to me?」

％Ｂ
「Oh, yes. It's very nice to meet you.」
Sora
「...Nice to meet you.」
all
Staff
「Oh, you can relax. This is an interview, but you two have already passed. I'll just be giving a simple description of the work you'll be doing.」


％Ｂ
「I see...」
Staff
「So anyway, the job involves something similar to customer service.」
This again...
Staff
「I guess you could say it's mostly miscellaneous tasks. It won't be for long since it's only until Friday, but we'll be counting on you. Anyway, that's all. That's the job.」


That really was simple...
Staff
「Oh, and could we get your measurements?」
％Ｂ
「Huh? Oh... No, I don't mind.」
I wonder why.
Maybe there's some kind of uniform for the event?
Staff
「You're, let's see... 178 centimeters tall. You're pretty big. And you are... 152 centimeters. You're real small!」

Sora
「...」
all
Staff
「And your shoulder span is... Hmhm... Okay, thanks. All right, the first event's on Monday, so please come here again at 9 a.m.」


％Ｂ
「Okay. We'll be taking our leave, then.」
Sora
「...Excuse.」
We head back to the marketplace after the very bare-bones interview.

％Ｂ
「That was over quicker than I thought...」
％Ｂ
「It's still too early to go back to school, so maybe we should go find some cardboard too while we're here.」

Sora
「...*nod*」
We head in a different direction from the stores I wrote down on the list for the others.
all
Shuuichi
「Oh, they're back.」

Natsuki
「Welcome baaack. How was the interview?」
％Ｂ
「We passed. We're starting on Monday, and it's until Friday the 25th.」

all
Shuuichi
「So you'll be able to start the dome construction on the 28th like planned.」
％Ｂ
「Yeah, we will. Oh, and we finished our interview early, so we also went around and got some cardboard.」

％Ｂ
「Though we only got three pieces 'cause we mostly went around to places that the other clubs went to already. How'd it go for you guys?」


Shuuichi
「Just take a look.」
％Ｂ
「Hm?」
all
Shuuichi points at a big pile of cardboard in the corner of the room.

Natsuki
「Your information came in handy.」
all
Rikka
「We got even more than we were expecting. It was a lot of work carrying it back with us.」
Touko
「There were a few places that didn't have any left, but we got enough to make up for that from other stores.」

％Ｂ
「I think this might be about half of what we need.」
all
Misa
「We looked through it ourselves earlier. It is slightly less than half. But I believe we should be able to reach our goal in three days at this rate.」

Marika
「There aren't going to be any store deliveries tomorrow because it's Sunday, but I think we'll be able to get lots again if we go on Monday.」

％Ｂ
「Really. That's great, Sora. Looks like we're making steady progress for the dome.」
all
Sora
「...*nod*」
She nods happily as she looks at the cardboard.
I'm sure she's imagining the sight of the planetarium dome we're going to make.
