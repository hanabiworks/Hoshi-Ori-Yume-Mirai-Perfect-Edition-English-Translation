Rikka
「Sigh... It's that time of the month again...」
I hold my stomach and sigh as I leave the bathroom.
I thought it was about time...
At least it's not as bad as last month's. I won't need to lie in bed this time.
But it's still painful.
My body feels sluggish, and I feel depressed.
Rikka
「I know getting pregnant makes your period go away... I guess that would free me from this pain and discomfort for a while...」
I go red when I realize what I'm contemplating.
You can't get pregnant on your own.
You need to deepen your love with the person you find precious, and have them give you the proof of their love.
And there's only one person who could do that for me.\n\r
I wouldn't have even thought of something like this a month ago.
And that's when a simple, yet important question comes to mind.
Rikka
「...Is it okay to have sex while I'm on my period? There's only a small chance of getting pregnant because I'm peeling away the baby's bed...」

...But if he puts it in while I'm bleeding down there...
...We just did it yesterday. I don't think even Ryousuke would ask to do it again so soon...
...We just did it yesterday. I don't think even ％Ｂ would ask to do it again so soon...
Rikka
「And I've started looking forward to doing it with him too, so I don't know if I'd be able to say no throughout my period if he wanted to... It was really embarrassing, but I'm glad we were able to do it yesterday.」


Being glad about it makes my face go hot again.
It's started to feel really good for me. Maybe my body's gotten used to it after doing it more with Ryousuke.
It's started to feel really good for me. Maybe my body's gotten used to it after doing it more with ％Ｂ.
Nowadays, I think I might want it just as much as he does.
...I'd definitely get made fun of if someone found out.
Even I've become aware my brain's been filled with thoughts about love ever since Ryousuke and I started dating.

Even I've become aware my brain's been filled with thoughts about love ever since ％Ｂ and I started dating.

But it doesn't feel like those thoughts have replaced something inside my mind. It's more like my capacity's increased to 150 or even 200 percent.

I can feel myself becoming more complete.
Rikka
「If Ryousuke still wants it... then maybe I could do it with my mouth. Though it felt really unnatural the first time I did that.」

Rikka
「If he still wants it... then maybe I could do it with my mouth. Though it felt really unnatural the first time I did that.」

But I started to think of it as cute yesterday.
Rikka
「If Ryousuke still wants it... then maybe I could do it with my mouth. Though it surprised me when he asked me to do that yesterday.」

Rikka
「If he still wants it... then maybe I could do it with my mouth. Though it surprised me when he asked me to do that yesterday.」

Rikka
「And he wanted it between my boobs too... I'm glad I was able to do it somehow, but I didn't know boys liked strange things like that.」


And yet I had come to think of it as cute as I was doing it.
It twitched in response to me licking it, putting it in my mouth, and sucking on it.

It was happy, telling me it all felt so good.
The way his thing reacts to my actions is so lovely to me.
Rikka
「Because it makes me happy when he looks like it feels good, or makes those sounds.」

It makes me want to do it for him again.
My phone buzzes on the living room table.
I run over to look. There's a very familiar name on the display.

Meguru
『Hello, Onee-chan? I just arrived in Japan!』
Rikka
「Wha... Your flight was today?」
Meguru
『Mhm. I kept it a secret because I wanted to surprise you.』
Rikka
「Hehe. Well, you succeeded. I'm definitely surprised. So when are you coming back here?」

Meguru
『I have a few meetings for work in Tokyo and Kanagawa, so I think maybe around this evening.』

Rikka
「I see, okay. Call me again, then. I'll come pick you up at Shionagi Station.」

Meguru
『Really? Thanks! I love you, Onee-chan!』
Rikka
「Hehe, you're such an opportunist. I'll be waiting for you to call.」
_smh_st_04
Rikka
「I see... So it's today...」
I'm genuinely happy Meguru's coming back.
She's my beloved little sister.
But there's a deep-rooted emotion that I can't control getting in the way of that happiness.

Rikka
「...My stomach hurts.」
I feel like my body's gotten just the slightest bit heavier than before.
$$smh_OpenCHK
％Ｂ
「Rikka, are you not feeling okay?」
I'm here to pick her up like always, and I couldn't help but think so when I saw her.

Rikka
「Wha... I'm not sick. Why do you ask?」
％Ｂ
「Just kind of a hunch... I guess it's just how you're carrying yourself? I feel like something's different.」
It's hard to point out anything specific.
It's probably a subtle change you normally couldn't notice.
It's a nuance kinda thing that I can only tell 'cause I see her every day.
Rikka
「Thank you. I can tell you're watching me carefully every day.」
％Ｂ
「It kinda makes me blush when you say it so straightforwardly...」
％Ｂ
「Anyway, is there really nothing wrong?」
Rikka
「...Mhm... Well, I think it might be good for you to know. It's not like it has nothing to do with you. This is embarrassing, so don't think about it too much, okay?」


％Ｂ
「O-Okay...」
Prefacing things with something like that's only gonna make that harder to do...
Rikka
「Um, well... It's about my... p-period...」
％Ｂ
「Your period...」
Having sex opens us up to the possibility of pregnancy...
And we did it raw yesterday too...
She's right that this is relevant information to me.
Rikka
「...My cycle usually puts my period at around the 25th, but it's a little earlier than usual this time. So... Um, it came, this morning...」
％Ｂ
「Ah...」
That's all I can say.
There's no way a guy could say anything other than "Ah" at that.
Rikka
「I'll try to be careful, but my health and emotions get unstable during my period... So I might end up causing you some trouble.」


I see. So that's why she seemed off.
％Ｂ
「All right. You don't need to try to be so considerate, though.」
％Ｂ
「I want to be with you for a long, long time. It'd be tiring to have to think about stuff like that every time, right?」

％Ｂ
「So you should just rely on me instead of saying you'll be careful. If there's something we need to fix, just tell me, and I'll do the same.」


Rikka
「Oh... Thank you. Hehe, mhm. I'll let you know right away. So I'll start, then... I have a request... Um, well... I want us to not have... s-sex... during my period.」
％Ｂ
「Ah...」
Yep, another "Ah."
There's nothing else I can say.
％Ｂ
「Right, yeah. That's fair. Nothing we can do about that.」
％Ｂ
「By the way, how long does it usually go for?」
Rikka
「It's usually about three to five days for me, I think...」
Five days...
That's a trivial amount of time to wait if it's for her sake.
Rikka
「But tell me if you really can't hold it. Um... I'll... use my mouth... instead...」

％Ｂ
「...」
My resolve's already about to crumble.
No. I can't just keep taking advantage of Rikka's kindness like that.
I need to become someone who can comfort her.
％Ｂ
「I'm glad you feel that way, but I won't ask you to. I'd feel like I'm just using you to relieve myself if I did that.」

％Ｂ
「Like I said earlier, I want our relationship to go on for a long time. And that relationship's gonna include your period too, right?」

％Ｂ
「I think we can just love each other together once you're feeling better.」

Rikka
「...Ehehe.」
She links arms with me tightly, and sticks right against me.
She rubs her head on my shoulder.
％Ｂ
「What's this for?」
Rikka
「I just really felt glad that you're my boyfriend. I think my period pains hurt a little less too. Maybe being happy lessens the symptoms. It's thanks to you.」
％Ｂ
「If this is all you need, then I'll help you out anytime.」
Rikka
「Hey...」
％Ｂ
「Hm?」
I look down to see her looking up at me longingly.

Seeing her like that makes my heart jump.
Rikka
「I'm going to end up making you wait for a while... but in exchange... let's do it lots once my period's over.」

％Ｂ
「Looking forward to it.」
Rikka
「You had a really dirty look in your eye just now.」
％Ｂ
「Well I am actually thinking dirty things.」
Rikka
「I wonder what kind of obscene things you're going to do to me... Hehe. I'm already getting worried.」

She looks happy, despite what she's saying.
Looks like I won't be jerking it while Rikka's on her period.
I wanna save it up for when we get to love each other.
I already can't wait to connect with her again.
all
％Ｂ
「Hup.」
I place the bags containing our home goods store purchases on the table.

They're the supplies we need to make little celestial bodies, like light bulbs and wire.

Marika
「Great job.」

Misa
「Boys are very strong!」
all
Sora
「Deneb, Vega, Altair, Antares, Arcturus, Denebola, Spica... I'm looking forward to making them.」

Sora
「I want to make the double star Albireo too. It's so pretty. Like a blue-and-gold jewel.」

all
Rikka
「Should I put this in the same spot?」
％Ｂ
「Yeah. Right there's fine.」
Rikka came to help after her concert team work finished early.


Touko
「I think it'd be lots more fun if you were always here, Piano-chan～」

％Ｂ
「Yeah, but she can't.」
Rikka
「I wish I were with you all sometimes too. But I have work that I've been assigned to because they thought I'd be suited for it.」

Touko
「You're so matuuure. I can't believe this is the same person who was like, "I want to hear your―mgahh!?」
all
I cover up Yukimura's mouth, all smiles, and bring my face close to hers threateningly.
％Ｂ
「Whaaat were you about to say just now～? Yukimura-saaan.」
Touko
「Yourh fashe, your fashe is shcawhy～」
％Ｂ
「Maybe that's because you did something that might make me get scary? I think you might know already?」

Touko
「...! ...!」
Looks like she understands. I pull my hand away.
Touko
「Hahhh～ I thought I was going to die～ You're unexpectedly scary when you're mad.」


Marika
「I think it's especially scary because he's usually so nice. But I don't think he's really mad.」

％Ｂ
「All I want is for you to stay quiet about that.」
all
That should be enough to preserve Rikka's dignity for now.
Rikka
「...So you're close enough with Yukimura-san to touch her like that, are you?」
But now she's sulking.

Touko
「Hmm... Jealous?」
I wish she wouldn't, but she's taunting Rikka now.
Rikka
「N-Not really.」
But I can tell that she's clearly displeased.

Touko
「Oh reeeally? It's okay if I do this, then? Hehe～」

all
％Ｂ
「H-Hey, Yukimura!」
Rikka
「Wha...! ...Uuh, mmhh～～～」
Yukimura's hugging me from behind.
My senses all reflexively focus on the two soft mounds squishing into my back.

And standing there before me is my beloved girlfriend, who looks like she might start grinding her teeth in irritation.

％Ｂ
「Yukimura... Don't tease Rikka too much, all right?」
Touko
「But don't you think Piano-chan's been really cute lately? Like she's gotten really approachable... Or maybe it's that she's worth messing with? And besides, this has a bit of a benefit for you too, doesn't it?」


％Ｂ
「Uh... M-My body no longer reacts to anyone other than Rikka. So while you may have some very impressive goods, they...」

Touko
「Ohh, really? Then maybe I'll hug you even hardeeer?」

％Ｂ
「P-Please don't... It's dangerous in a lot of ways.」
Rikka
「Uuuuuuuuh～～... No!」
all
She pulls a little, but still strongly, on my sleeve.
Yukimura smiles awkwardly when she sees that and pulls away.
％Ｂ
「Rikka?」
Rikka looks up at me like an abandoned puppy. She doesn't let go of my sleeve.

Rikka
「I seem to forget my surroundings when it comes to you. It's bothersome for me to get jealous over something like this, isn't it...?」

％Ｂ
「No, it's not.」
It's embarrassing to say what I'm thinking next in front of the others, but I really want to...

I bring my lips up to her ear and whisper it to her.
％Ｂ
「If anything, it's so cute I wanted to hug you as hard as I could.」
Rikka
「～～～～～Gh!! Geez, stupid! What are you thinking, with the others here!」

％Ｂ
「Don't worry, I won't.」
Rikka
「...You won't do it?」
She looks at me with wet eyes. She's close enough to kiss... I hold my urges in.

Rikka
「...I want you to hold me tight enough to break me. When we're alone together.」
％Ｂ
「We'll do that, then.」
Rikka
「Mhm. Hehe.」
Touko
「Hahaha... I can't watch this.」
Sora
「...Cringey couple.」
The second chemistry classroom's livelier than usual.
And that's because Rikka's here.
Things are brighter when Rikka's around. We all feel more together.

We've only all known each other for about two months, but we've spent a lot of valuable time together.

Rikka
「So about the star-making. Maybe we could try bundling the wiring for each constellation so we can turn them on and off all at once?」
Rikka
「I don't know if we can do it because I don't know that much about wiring, but it seems like we could do something like an illumination show at a certain time during the festival.」

Marika
「That's a great idea!」
％Ｂ
「Female guests would probably like something like that.」
all
Sora
「...*nod* Can we do it?」
％Ｂ
「I don't really know that much about that kinda stuff either, so...」
％Ｂ
「Oh, I know. I remember seeing an engineering club on the list back when we were confirming participation for the Tanabata Festival. They probably know what to do, so I'll contact them later.」

Misa
「That would make for a much more wonderful Tanabata Festival if possible!」
all
It's like Yukimura said. Rikka's changing.
And these changes are to be celebrated.
She's volunteering to help us, and she's come to make suggestions of her own too.

My heart fills with warmth watching Rikka interact with her friends.

all
I can hear a phone ring as we're about to wrap things up for the day.
Rikka
「Hello? ...Okay. Mhm... Got it. I'll head over now.」
She hangs up after a short conversation.
Rikka
「I'm sorry. Would it be okay if I left a little early? I told Meguru I'd go pick her up at Shionagi Station.」

％Ｂ
「Meguru? You mean your little sister?」
Rikka
「Mhm. She's coming home today. She just told me she's on the train from the airport, so she should be here soon.」

％Ｂ
「You should hurry and go to pick her up, then.」
Everyone nods in agreement.
all
Shuuichi
「Now I have to say, this is good timing on my part.」
％Ｂ
「Shuuichi. How long have you been there?」
Suddenly, Shuuichi's standing in the doorway.
Shuuichi
「Since just now. Ryousuke, you go with her too.」
Shuuichi
「Since just now. You go with her too.」
％Ｂ
「Why me? Rikka's going, so there's no need, is there?」
Shuuichi
「Narusawa's there as family. She's an important guest performer for the Shio-cademy Fest. Of course we have to give her a warm welcome.」
％Ｂ
「But then that should be someone from the concert team, shouldn't it?」

Shuuichi
「You're right about that... but unfortunately, Ishizuka-san's got something she has to attend to. She left it up to me and went home.」

％Ｂ
「You go, then.」
Shuuichi
「It's Narusawa's sister we're talking about. What am I gonna do if she hurls verbal abuse at me the moment we meet? I don't have your mental fortitude.」

Rikka
「I have a few questions for you, Nirasawa-kun.」
Shuuichi
「...Ahem. I'm busy at the moment, so if you could please save those for a later date.」
％Ｂ
「You're just too lazy to go.」
Shuuichi
「I won't deny that. But―」
Shuuichi
「If she's Narusawa's younger sister, then that means she might be your sister-in-law one day. You're curious what she's like too, right?」

％Ｂ
「Well, yeah...」
I don't really know anything about Narusawa's family, so of course I'm interested.

％Ｂ
「All right, sure. I'll go.」
Shuuichi
「So you finally understand, oh friend of mine.」
Natsuki
「It's gross watching two guys whispering with their faces close like that.」
Shuuichi
「You all do the same thing all the time! Don't discriminate based on gender!」

％Ｂ
「That's right! He might swing that way, but I don't!」
Shuuichi
「Agh, hey! You're trying to escape by yourself!?」
％Ｂ
「Sorry, Shuuichi. I've already got my precious girlfriend, Rikka. And I'm not really into guys...」

Shuuichi
「And I've got Kaori-san! What the hell are you trying to make it look like I'm interested in you for!?」
Marika
「Ahahah～」
all
Shionagi Station's the city's central train station.
There's a ramp running up from the marketplace, adjoining the central entrance hall of the station on the second floor.

There's a flood of people walking through... I guess a train must have just arrived.
And in that crowd is...
Meguru
「Oh...! Onee-chaaaan!!」
A small girl runs toward Rikka after spotting her.
She throws her arms around Rikka.
Meguru
「Eheh～ Long time no see, Onee-chan～ I wanted to see you～」
Rikka
「I wanted to see you too. Welcome home, Meguru.」
Meguru
「Yeah, I'm hooome～」
She seems pretty different from what I expected.
I thought she'd be more calm and composed like Rikka, judging from those posters...

Or maybe she's just like this in front of her family?
all
Meguru
「Huh? Um... Who is this?」
She finally notices me...
％Ｂ
「Oh, I'm...」
It'd be weird to suddenly introduce myself as her boyfriend, right?
And I'm here as a representative for the event committee today anyway.
％Ｂ
「I'm ％Ａ ％Ｂ. I'm here to greet you today as a representative for Shionagi First Academy's event organization committee. Thank you very much for agreeing to perform at the festival this year.」


Meguru
「Oh, I see. Thank you very much for coming all the way out to welcome me. I apologize for the slightly embarrassing sight just now.」
Meguru
「I'm Narusawa Meguru, a pianist. I'm honored to be able to perform at a concert for a school as storied as yours. I will be playing the best that I am able. I am pleased to make your acquaintance.」
She formally bows her head in response to my bow.
That childish image of her hugging Rikka gets blown away, leaving a professional woman in its place.

She's Narusawa's little sister, which means she should be younger than me, but she seems a lot more mature.

Meguru
「I will be coming by for our meeting tomorrow. And so...」

％Ｂ
「Ah, yes. I really am here just to greet you today, so we can conduct our business tomorrow.」

Meguru
「Yes. So he says, Onee-chan. I didn't have much to eat for lunch, I'm staaarving～」


Rikka
「Hehe, okay. Do you want to eat somewhere on the way home?」
Meguru
「I want to eat your cooking! It's been so long!」
I probably shouldn't get in the way of their reunion any further.
all
％Ｂ
「Rikka. I'll head out.」
Rikka
「I'm sorry. After you came with me, too.」
％Ｂ
「You haven't seen each other in a while, right? You guys should just have fun without worrying about me. See you tomorrow.」

Rikka
「Thank you. I'll see you tomorrow.」
Meguru
「...」
％Ｂ
「And Narusawa Meguru-san, I will now be taking my leave.」
Meguru
「Oh, yes. Thank you very much for coming to greet me. It made me very happy. See you tomorrow.」

％Ｂ
「Okay.」
all
Rikka's little sister, the world-renowned pianist... Narusawa Meguru.
She's proper, but she seems friendly, and not particularly distant or unapproachable. 

But she seems strangely mature. She's young, but she's clearly been living in the world of adults.

Now that I think about it, I wonder if it's all right for me to tell her I'm dating Rikka.
％Ｂ
「I'll ask Rikka over LIME tonight I guess.」
